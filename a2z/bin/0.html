These scripts are intended to help you find and install packages, and
otherwise work with the disc.  Feel free to adapt them to your own needs,
if they do not currently do what you wish.  Let us know about any bugs or
other opportunities for improvement:  ptf-bugs@cfcl.com

Much of the complexity in these scripts results from the fact that there
are four distinct decisions a UNIX vendor can make in presenting ISO-9660
file names to the user.  The decisions are whether or not to:

     hide version numbers
     map alphabetic characters to lower case
     hide trailing periods when no extension exists

A given ISO-9660 file (e.g., "FOO.;1") may thus be displayed by your UNIX
system in any of eight possible ways:

     foo             foo.            foo;1           foo.;1
     FOO             FOO.            FOO;1           FOO.;1

Because ISO-9660 files have no permission bits, vendors also get to chose
among some 4096 (2^12) possible mode combinations.  Worse, some vendors do
not allow direct execution of scripts, even when the mode allows it.  We
have therefore decided to assume mode 444 (r--r--r--).

We have attempted to make our scripts work in all cases.  We try to handle
all case, mode, and version number variations.  By ensuring that all our
file names have extensions, we eliminate the trailing period problem.  We
may have failed in some respect, however, or your vendor may have created
yet another case.  If so, please let us know (ptf-bugs@cfcl.com).
