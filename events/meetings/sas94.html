                           CALL FOR PAPERS

             1st International  Static Analysis Symposium (SAS'94)
                 Namur (Belgium) September 28-30, 1994

Static Analysis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental tool for
high performance implementations and verification systems of high-level
programming languages. The last two decades have witnessed substantial
developments in this area, ranging from the theoretical frameworks to
the design and implementation of analysers and their applications in
optimizing compilers.
  SAS'94 is the first international symposium on static analysis.
 It is motivated by the success of the three previous international workshops
Jtaspefl and WSA'92, which were held in Bordeaux (France) and WSA'93
which took place in Padova (Italy). The technical program for the symposium
will consist of invited lectures, presentations of refereed papers and
software demonstrations. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of Static
Analysis, including, but not limited to

Abstract Domains                Optimizing Compilers
Applications                    Specific Analyses
Complexity                      Theoretical Frameworks
Experimental Evaluation         Verification Systems
Fixpoint Algorithms             Type Inference
Partial Evaluation


Contributions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent,
constraint, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming.


Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15 pages (excluding
references and figures), and must contain a cover page including the following:
a 200 words abstract, keywords, and postal and electronic mailing addresses as
well as phone numbers and fax numbers of one of the authors.

Send SIX (6) copies of your submission by APRIL 30, 1994 to

	Baudouin Le Charlier,
	Institut d'Informatique,
	Facultes Universitaires de Namur (F.U.N.D.P.),
	rue Grandgagnage, 21
	B-5000				Namur(Belgium)
	Email: ble@info.fundp.ac.be
	Phone: +32 81 724977		Fax:	+32 81 724967

Authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their papers by
JUNE 30, 1994. Final versions of the accepted papers must be received in
camera-ready form by JULY 20, 1994. We anticipate that the proceedings will be
published by Springer Verlag in the LNCS series.
