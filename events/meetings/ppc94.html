              International Conference on Proof Theory,
                 Provability Logic, and Computation
                        March 20-24, 1994
                  University of Berne, Switzerland

CALL FOR PAPERS

The central aim of this meeting is to provide a platform for the
presentation of recent results in the areas of Proof Theory,
Provability Logic, and Computation where these are interrelated.
More specifically, the main emphasis will be on the following:

- Applications of Proof Theory to Theoretical Computer Science.

- New developments in Provability Logic related to Computer Science

- New challenges from Computer Science for Proof Theory and
  Provability Logic.

The conference is intended for logicians and computer scientists
interested in the interaction of proof theory and theoretical
computer science.

The scientific program will consist of invited lectures and
short contributions, which will be selected from the submitted
papers.

All contributions will be refereed for a special issue of the
journal "Annals of Pure and Applied Logic" devoted to the conference,
where selected papers will be published.

An extended abstract (2 pages) of papers to be submitted should
be sent to the address below not later than January 5, 1994.

The authors will be notified of acceptance for presentation
to the workshop by February 5.

The  complete  paper to be submitted for publication should not
exceed 15 pages and must be available before April 30, 1994.

The conference fee is SFr 200.--.
