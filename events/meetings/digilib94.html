Digital libraries are destined to be the first true archives of
integrated multimedia data. Currently, we have corpora of text, image,
and sound files. Soon we expect to have corpora of electronic books
which are capable of subsuming most of the media we use today and have
the potential for added functionality by being interactive.

A digital library is a unification of all available data repositories
through a single interface. That interface should be expected to cope
with whatever kind of data, e.g., text, image, and sound that is being
retrieved. Furthermore, this interface should serve as an effective
access means for scientists, engineers, managers as well as everyday
individuals.

With the new initiative to build a better information infrastructure,
it has become even more important to develop better means for
managing, locating, and retrieving information and knowledge bases.

We believe that the technologies of Parallelism, Networking/
Communications, Multi-media, User-interfaces, Database Management, and
Information Management will play an important role in making digital
libraries a reality.


OBJECTIVE: The aim of the workshop is to provide an international
forum to discuss evolving research issues and applications in digital
libraries.  Invited speakers from industry, universities, and
government will present their experiences and vision for the future.

The following are among  the invited speakers and panelists.

 - Ron Ashany, Program Director, Database and Expert Systems, NSF
 - Ed Fox, Virginia Tech  
 - Milton Halem, Chief of Space Data and Computing Division, NASA
 - Mike Lesk, Bellcore
 - William Steele, Director, Business Development, GTE
 - Don Tiedeman, Vice-President, AT&T
