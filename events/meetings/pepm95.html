			   Call for Papers
		       ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on
   Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation (PEPM '95)
	       La Jolla, California, June 21-23, 1995

The PEPM 1995 symposium brings together researchers working in the
areas of semantics-based program manipulation and partial evaluation.
The symposium focuses broadly on techniques and supporting theory for
the analysis and manipulation of programs to improve performance.
Technical topics include, but are not limited to:

  - Program manipulation techniques: program transformation, program
    specialization, partial evaluation.

  - Program analysis techniques: abstract interpretation, static
    analysis, binding-time analysis.

  - Related issues in language design and models of computation:
    functional, logic programming, object oriented, parallel, distributed.

  - Programs as data objects: meta-programming, incremental computation,
    tools and techniques, prototyping and debugging.

  - Applications: scientific computing, compiler generation, algorithm
    design.

Original results that bear on these and related topics are solicited.
Prospective authors should submit papers directly to the program chair
at the address below to arrive not later than November 16, 1994.
Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are encouraged
to consult with the program chair prior to submission.

Papers may be submitted electronically, either in Postscript or as a
self-contained TeX or LaTeX file.  Hard-copy submissions will also be
accepted, which should include 7 copies, double-sided if possible.
Submissions should not exceed 5000 words (about 10 pages), excluding
bibliography and figures.  Final papers may be longer.  Excessively
long submissions may be rejected outright by the program chair.
Submissions should designate a corresponding author and include a
mailing address, phone number, and Internet email address for
correspondence.

Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance,
relevance, correctness, and clarity.  They should include a clear
identification of what has been accomplished and why it is
significant.  Submissions must include an abstract and discussion of
related work.  Papers must describe work that has not previously been
published in a major forum.  Authors should indicate if a closely
related paper is also being considered for another conference or
journal.

Authors will be notified of acceptance by February 7, 1995.
Full versions of the accepted papers will be formatted according to
ACM conventions, and a camera-ready copy must be received by the
program chair no later than March 24, 1995.  Authors of accepted
papers must sign an ACM copyright release form.  Accepted papers will
be presented at the symposium and will appear in the proceedings
published by ACM.  Information about the conference is available on
the world-wide web at
