The Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular 
Biology will take place at Stanford University in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, August 14-17, 1994.  The ISMB conference, held for the first time 
last summer in Bethesda, MD, attracted an overflow crowd, yielded an 
excellent offering of papers, invited speakers, posters and tutorials, 
provided an exciting opportunity for researchers to meet and exchange 
ideas, and was an important forum for the developing field.  We will 
continue the tradition of pre-published, rigorously refereed proceedings, 
and opportunities for fruitful personal interchange.

The conference will bring together scientists who are applying the 
technologies of advanced data modeling, artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, probabilistic reasoning, massively parallel computing, robotics, 
and related computational methods to problems in molecular biology.  We 
invite participation from both developers and users of any novel system, 
provided it supports a biological task that is cognitively challenging, 
involves a synthesis of information from multiple sources at multiple 
levels, or in some other way exhibits the abstraction and emergent 
properties of an "intelligent system."  The four-day conference will 
feature introductory tutorials (August 14), presentations of original 
refereed papers and invited talks (August 15-17).

Paper submissions should be single-spaced, 12 point type, 12 pages 
maximum including title, abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography with 
titles.  The first page should include the full postal address, electronic 
mailing address, telephone and FAX number of each author.  Also, please 
list five to ten keywords describing the methods and concepts discussed 
in the paper.  State whether you wish the paper to be considered for oral 
presentation only, poster presentation only or for either presentation 
format.  Submit 6 copies to the address below.  For more information, 
please contact ismb@camis.stanford.edu.

Proposals for introductory tutorials must be well documented, including 
the purpose and intended audience of the tutorial as well as previous 
experience of the author in presenting such material.  Those considering 
submitting tutorial proposals are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page 
outline, before the deadline, to enable early feed-back regarding topic 
and content suitability.  The conference will pay an honorarium and 
support, in part, the travel expenses of tutorial speakers.

Limited funds are available to support travel to ISMB-94 for those students, 
post-docs, minorities and women who would otherwise be unable to attend..

Please submit papers and tutorial proposals to:
