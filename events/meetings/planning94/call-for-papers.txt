			  CONFERENCE CHAIR 	
		Austin Tate -  Edinburgh University

			   PROGRAM CHAIR
 	      Kristian Hammond - University of Chicago

We are pleased to invite contributions for the Second International
Conference on AI Planning Systems, to be held at The University of
Chicago, June 15th - 17th, 1994.

This conference will be aimed at bringing together researchers
attacking different aspects of the planning problem and related
issues.  In addition to AI researchers, others working on
planning-related issues are also encouraged to contribute and attend.
Of special interest are papers discussing the integration of differing
approaches to planning or the integration of planning and other AI
technologies.

Topics of Interest Include:

APPLICATIONS - Empirical studies of existing planning systems;
domain-specific techniques; heuristic techniques; scheduling systems.

ARCHITECTURES - Real-time support for planning and control;
mixed-initiative planning and user interfaces.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND TASK MODELS - Analyses of the dynamics of
environments, tasks, and domains with regard to different models of
planning and execution.

FORMAL MODELS - Reasoning about knowledge, action, and time; search
methods and analysis of algorithms; formal characterization of
existing planners.

INTELLIGENT AGENCY - Resource-bound reasoning; distributed problem
solving; integrating reaction and deliberation.

LEARNING - Learning in the context of planning and execution; learning
new plans and operators.

MEMORY-BASED APPROACHES - Case-based planning; plan and operator
learning and reuse; incremental planning.

PLANNING AND PERCEPTION - Integration of planning and perceptual
systems.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ISSUES - Analyses of goal-directed
behavior; neurophysiological studies concerning planning;
connectionist planning systems.

REACTIVE SYSTEMS - Environmentally driven devices/behaviors; reactive
control; behaviors in the context of minimal representations.

ROBOTICS - Motion and path planning; planning and control; planning
and perception.

                    REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION

TIMETABLE - The conference will take place June 15th - 17th,1994, at
the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.  Authors must submit 5
copies of their papers (no electronic or Fax transmissions) by Tuesday
December 14th, 1993.  Notification of receipt will be sent to the
first (or designated) author soon thereafter.  Notification of
acceptance or rejection will be mailed by February 18, 1994.  Authors
will need to provide camera ready copy by March 8, 1994.

APPEARANCE - Papers should be printed on 8.5" x 11" (or, if necessary,
A4) sized paper, with 12 point type. Letter quality print is required.
(Normally, dot-matrix printout will be unacceptable unless truly of
letter quality.  Exceptions will be made for submissions from
countries where high quality printers are not widely available.) LaTeX
12pt article style will be acceptable.

TITLE PAGE - Each copy of the paper must include a title page,
separate from the body of the paper.  This should contain (i) Title,
(ii) Names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of all
authors, and (iii) An abstract of 100-200 words.

LENGTH - Papers should be submitted in 12 point text filling roughly
5.5" x 7.5" per page (LaTeX article style with 12 point text is
acceptable).  Papers should be no more than 12 pages including
figures, tables, diagrams, and references.  Short papers (5 pages or
less) may be submitted for review as posters.  All papers will be
included in the conference proceedings.

DEMONSTRATIONS - Participants wanting to give computer and/or video
taped demonstrations should send a two page abstract describing their
contribution to the same address by February 22, 1994.  These
abstracts should include a separate title page with a (i) Program name
and (ii) Names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of all
authors.  Demonstrations will be held in concert with the conference's
poster session.

PANELS - Researchers interested in organizing panels should get hold
of the program chair as soon as possible.

All submissions should be sent to:

	AIPS-94

	Department of Computer Science
	University of Chicago
	1100 East 58th Street
	Chicago, IL 60637
