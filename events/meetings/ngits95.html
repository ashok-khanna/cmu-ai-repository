				Call for Papers

				   NGITS '95

		    The Second International Workshop on
	     Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems
				       
			      27 - 29 June 1995
			Hotel Carlton, Naharia, ISRAEL
				       
	  Supported by the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology
			   and the Neaman Institute
				       
As information technology advances, requirements of and expectations from
information systems change rapidly.  This requires researchers and developers
to continuously focus on the next generation of information systems.

The NGITS Workshop provides an international forum for discussing issues and
solutions related exclusively to next generation information systems and the
technologies that would make them possible.

These issues include, but are not limited to:

o  Data and knowledge base challenges: advanced models and languages,
   data integrity and quality, management of uncertainty and inconsistency, 
   information security and privacy, management of spatial and temporal data
o  Software architectures for information systems: object-orientation,
   agent-orientation, extensibility, groupware, software repositories,
   application generators
o  Integration: intelligent integration and interchange of information,
   interoperability and cooperation among heterogeneous information systems,
   information mediation and brokering, standardization
o  AI techniques: knowledge management, knowledge representation and reasoning,
   knowledge discovery, information extraction and filtering, coordination
   technologies and agent architectures
o  Human-computer interaction: advanced user interfaces, human-computer
   cooperation
o  The impact of new technologies: multi-media, mobile computing, 
   very high speed networks, etc.
o  Challenging applications: services and tools to support information
   infrastructure ("information super-highways"), digital libraries, 
   large scientific and geographical databases, health care (medical) 
   information systems, information systems for advanced manufacturing

We solicit contributions of three kinds:

* Full research papers
* Short position papers
* Proposals for panel discussions

All contributions must emphasize their relevance to issues of next generation
information technologies and systems, and must be addressed to an audience of
diverse background and interests.  The category of "research papers" is
intended for technical papers describing research accomplishments.  The
category "position papers" is intended for papers that discuss new challenges
and visionary solutions.  Proposals for panels should include an abstract of
the subject and likely participants.

The workshop will feature paper sessions, panel discussions and talks by
invited speakers.  All accepted papers will appear in a workshop proceedings.
Selected papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of
Intelligent Information Systems.
