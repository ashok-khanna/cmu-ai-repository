     TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING (ML95)
			Tahoe City, California
			   July 9-12, 1995

		     CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The ML-95 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program
of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning (ML-95).
Informal workshops will be held 9 July 1995. Workshop participants
will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected
focus -- providing an informal setting for active exchange among
researchers, developers and users on topics of interest.  Members of
all segments of the ML community are encouraged to submit proposals.

To encourage interaction and exchange of ideas, we prefer small
informal workshops, with 25-50 participants, most of whom will be
active participants. The format of the workshop presentations will be
determined by the organizers, who are encouraged to leave ample time
for general discussion. Workshops will typically be one full day in
length, although half-day proposals will be considered.

** PROPOSAL CONTENT **

Proposals for workshops should be about 2 pages in length, and should
contain:
- A description of the workshop. Identify the specific issues
        on which the workshop will focus.
- A brief discussion of why the workshop is of particular
        interest at this time.
- The names and addresses of the organizing committee; 3 to
        4 people knowledgeable in the field. Strong proposals
        include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the
        workshop topic.
- An indication as to whether the workshop should be
        considered for a half-day, one or two-day meeting.

** SUBMISSIONS **

Workshop proposals should be submitted as soon as possible but NO
LATER THAN 15 December 1994. Organizers will be notified of the
committee's decision by 15 January 1995.  Workshop organizers will be
responsible for producing a call for participation. The Call is due 15
February 1995.  We will post the call in various newsgroups;
individual organizers are also encouraged to distribute the Call
themselves.

** PARTICIPANT SELECTION **

Workshop attendance is by invitation of the organizers.  Selection of
attendees will be made by the organizers on the basis of submissions;
we encourage organizers to impose a deadline for submissions, perhaps
20 March 1995.  Workshop organizers will need to provide the ML '95
conference organizers with a list of the participants by 1 June 1995.

Please submit (preferably by email) your workshop proposal and address
inquiries concerning workshops to:
