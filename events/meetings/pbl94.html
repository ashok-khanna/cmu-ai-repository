REFLECTION & CONSOLIDATION

PBL is now widely acknowledged and regarded for its educational and
training objectives. This conference theme is concerned with the need to
consolidate what has occurred in the recent past and to support the
foundations which have been laid in previous years. Presentations will
address one of the following;

1	Practical Applications. - This strand is particularly relevant to
  those at early stages in development of PBL applications

2	Development and Evaluation. - Of particular relevance to those
  already involved in PBL, this strand addresses detailed issues of
  implementation and evaluation.

3	Theory and Research in PBL.- Leading Edge Issues.

Papers in each of these categories should consider the conference theme
of "Reflection and consolidation". Papers relating PBL with topical
issues such as quality in teaching and competency based education and
training would be particularly welcome.
