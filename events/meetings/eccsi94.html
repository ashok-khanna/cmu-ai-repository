		             Call for Papers

		   THE FIRST EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON
		    "COGNITIVE SCIENCE IN INDUSTRY"

		28th - 30th September 1994 - Luxembourg



OBJECTIVES

The study of human operational strategies and human processes is a particularly
well developed area of Cognitive Science. This particular domain belongs to the
larger field of Information Science, which considers semantic and qualitative
aspects of information, rather than digital and qualitative ones. This
represents an important issue for industries concerned with human beings in a
work place context because Cognitive Science provides a great number of
additional dimensions allowing to conceive more complete systems.

It is the purpose of the European Conference on Cognitive Science to assemble
theoreticians and practitioners from industry and academic institutions to
discuss questions related to the practical application of Cognitive Science in
industrial settings. The conference will be a forum for those who recognize the
need to develop theories, methods, and systems to ensure the transfer of
laboratory results into real-life problem situations. Furthermore, the European
Conference on Cognitive Science will facilitate the exchange of expertise among
practitioners.

The organizing committee plans to hold the conference in collaboration with the
following institutions:

	GDR-CNRS 957 Sciences Cognitives de Paris, France
	Ecole Nationale Superieure de Telecommunication de Bretagne, France
	Universite Paris Sorbonne, France
	Centre de Recherche Public - CU, Luxembourg
	Centre Universitaire, Luxembourg
	DFKI, Germany
	Universitat Kaiserslautern, Germany
	Universitat Freiburg, Germany


CALL FOR PAPERS

Two types of papers are solicited: those discussing on cognitive theories in
the context of industrial practice and those presenting industrial applications.
Suitable conferences and panel discussion themes include:

	o	Cognitive robotics
	o	Man-Machine cooperation
	o	Cognitive organization and cooperation
	o	Intelligent assistance for decision
	o	Knowledge engineering, acquisition and modeling
	o	Distributed cognition and multi agents system
	o	Perception, recognition, interpretation and action
	o	Planning
	o	Intelligent management of multimedia documents
	o	Piloting of important projects


	Applications, ongoing developments and relevant experimentations
	in the areas of:
	o	Transports
	o	Bank
	o	Assurances
	o	Health
	o	Telecommunications
	o	Environment protection
	o	Production
	o	Supervision and control


SUBMISSION DETAILS

Two classes of submission are solicited - long papers, which should not exceed
30 pages, and short papers, which should be up to 10 pages. Reports of
industrial applications should ideally be presented as short papers. The program
committee is seeking for original papers in all areas concerning the use of
cognitive science for industrial problem solving. Papers could either describe
industrial cases, significant results from ongoing research or user experience,
or offer a critical analysis of current theories, tools or techniques in this
domain.


IMPORTANT DATES

Papers should be submitted by the 7th March 1994. Notification of acceptance
will be by the 30th May 1994. The final version of accepted papers must be
received by the 4th July.
