tools; hardware implementations; cognitive models of the brain and their 
impact.

* Neural networks for problem solving: handling large experimental data bases; 
speech-, image- and text processing; time-series prediction; control; 
diagnosis, etc.

* Fuzzy systems: methods; tools; software and hardware implementations; fuzzy 
systems for problem solving; soft programming.

* Expert systems: machine learning and knowledge acquisition; methods for 
representing inexact data and uncertain knowledge; approximate reasoning; 
tools and systems; object-oriented systems. 

* Hybrid systems: integrating neural networks and AI-techniques; integrating 
neural networks and fuzzy systems; extending existing software tools with 
fuzzy reasoning and neural nets.    

* Applications of expert systems and neural networks in: Manufacturing; 
Process Control; Quality Testing; Finance; Economics; Marketing; Management; 
Banking; Agriculture; Environment Protection; Medicine; Geographic information 
systems; and other application areas.
