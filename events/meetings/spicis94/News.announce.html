The Second Singapore International Conference on Intelligent Systems
will be held in Singapore on 14-17 November, 1994. The conference is
intended to provide a forum for presentations of applications of
intelligent systems with a sectoral focus, as well as research on
intelligent system  technology that enable such applications. In
addition to the technical sessions, there will be keynote, invited
and tutorial sessions, as well as a panel on Intelligent System
Applications in the Pacific Rim countries.

Papers from all countries are sought in three main tracks:
(1) Present applications of intelligent systems to the solution of
    problems in business, industry and other areas;
(2) Describe research on intelligent systems technology that enable
    such applications;
(3) Address issues in the deployment of intelligent systems.

Areas of application include but are not limited to:
agriculture, communications, construction & real estate, education &
training, financial services, government, healthcare, publishing &
information services, manufacturing, retail, wholesale & distribution,
transportation.

Intelligent system technologies include but are not limited to:
knowledge-based systems, neural networks, fuzzy systems, vision,
robotics, knowledge engineering, multimedia, natural language
processing, human-computer interfaces, tutoring systems, machine
learning.

Topics in the deployment of intelligent systems include but are not
limited to:
justification for intelligent system projects, organizational issues,
business process reengineering, human resources, integration with
databases and information systems, knowledge sharing & reuse, knowledge
acquisition, validation & verification.
