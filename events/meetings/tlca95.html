First Call for Papers, TLCA
International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications

April 10--12, 1995, Edinburgh, Scotland

The second international conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and 
Applications will be held April 10--12, 1995, at Edinburgh in Scotland.  
The conference aims at providing a forum for the presentation and 
discussion of recent research in the following areas:

Proof theory of type systems 
Logic and type systems 
Typed lambda calculi as models of (higher order) computation 
Semantics of type systems 
Proof verification via type systems 
Type systems of programming languages
Typed term rewriting systems

The program of TLCA will consist of about 30 selected presentations in 
plenary sessions.  The program committee for TLCA is chaired by 
M. Dezani and has the following members: 

 H. Barendregt  (Catholic University of Nijmegen)
