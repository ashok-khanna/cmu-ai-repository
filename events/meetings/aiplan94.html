			   PROGRAM CHAIR
 	      Kristian Hammond - University of Chicago

We are pleased to invite contributions for the Second International
Conference on AI Planning Systems, to be held at The University of
Chicago, June 15th - 17th, 1994.

This conference will be aimed at bringing together researchers
attacking different aspects of the planning problem and related
issues.  In addition to AI researchers, others working on
planning-related issues are also encouraged to contribute and attend.
Of special interest are papers discussing the integration of differing
approaches to planning or the integration of planning and other AI
technologies.

Topics of Interest Include:

APPLICATIONS -Empirical studies of existing planning systems;
domain-specific techniques; heuristic techniques; scheduling systems.

ARCHITECTURES - Real-time support for planning and control;
mixed-initiative planning and user interfaces.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND TASK MODELS - Analyses of the dynamics of
environments, tasks, and domains with regard to different models of
planning and execution.

FORMAL MODELS - Reasoning about knowledge, action, and time; search
methods and analysis of algorithms; formal characterization of
existing planners.

INTELLIGENT AGENCY - Resource-bound reasoning; distributed problem
solving; integrating reaction and deliberation.

LEARNING - Learning in the context of planning and execution; learning
new plans and operators.

MEMORY-BASED APPROACHES - Case-based planning; plan and operator
learning and reuse; incremental planning.

PLANNING AND PERCEPTION - Integration of planning and perceptual
systems.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ISSUES - Analyses of goal-directed
behavior; neurophysiological studies concerning planning;
connectionist planning systems.

REACTIVE SYSTEMS - Environmentally driven devices/behaviors; reactive
control; behaviors in the context of minimal representations.

ROBOTICS - Motion and path planning; planning and control; planning
and perception.
