           The Second Symposium on Natural Language Processing 
                            August 2-4, 1995
                  Hyatt Central Plaza, Bangkok, Thailand 

     Supported by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center

                 Hosted by Kasetsart University, Thailand 

                        Papers Due March 15, 1995

CONFERENCE THEME
	The primary objective of the symposium is to determine the present 
situation of every sub-area of natural language processing especially,  
but not limited to, Asian languages and then to seek an appropriate 
direction for extensive research pertaining to computer technology which 
would be beneficial to NLP in the future.  The symposium will serve as 
a forum for researchers and participants who have been working on the 
languages of diverse families spoken to exchange ideas and information.
	Moreover, as 1995 has been declared the National Information 
Technology Year of Thailand, on behalf of the government of Thailand through 
the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Ministry of 
Science, Technology and Environment, the organizing committee would like 
to extend an invitation to all who are interested in NLP to participate 
in this symposium from August 2-4, 1995.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
	Submissions are invited on substantial, original, and previously
unpublished research and applications of natural language processing, 
especially those of Asian languages. Topics of interest include but 
are not limited to:	
		*  Natural Language Understanding		
		*  Machine Translation				
		*  Discourse Processing				
		*  Local Language Processing and Applications
		*  Character Recognition and Font Development	
		*  Speech Recognition and Synthesizing	   	
		*  Word Processing and Collaborative Writing
		*  NLP Product Development			
		*  I/O Processing including of CD Storage		
		*  Database Design and Text Search

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES
	Authors are invited to submit THREE copies of papers, written in 
English, of up to 20 double-spaced A4-size pages, presenting the results 
of original research or innovative practical applications relevant to one 
or more of the topics of interest.    Submissions should be received by 
the Program Chair by March 15, 1995.
	Each paper must have a separate page with the title, full name of 
all authors and their complete addresses, affiliations, telephones, faxes 
and email addresses. The first page of the manuscript should contain the 
title and an abstract of 100-200 words.  All papers will undergo a review 
process. Accepted papers will be published in the symposium proceedings.

PROPOSALS
	In addition to papers, we will be accepting proposals for panel 
discussion and proposals for tutorials.  Topics and desired participants 
should be presented in a summary of up to 1000 words.

IMPORTANT DATES
	March 15, 1995:        Three copies of papers and proposals are due.
	April 30, 1995:        Author notifications will be mailed.
	June  30, 1995:        Camera-ready copies are due.
