         International Seminar on Diagnostics and Control 
           through Neural Interpretations of Fuzzy Sets

               Mariehamn, AAland, June 13-17, 1994 


***

The MEPP seminars were initiated by Aldo Ventre in 1990, 
with the first seminar organized in Ischia, October 7-11, 1990. 
The seminars bring people to a discussion on efforts and 
consequences of bridging the gap between successful fuzzy systems 
applications and supporting foundational developments.

Leading subtitles  for MEPP 91-93 were "diagnostics and control 
through neural interpretations of fuzzy sets", 
covering applications in control and diagnostics. In these 
areas, the MEPP seminars respect engineering approaches, 
involving know-how and skill required for putting things to 
work, paradigmic approaches, focusing on development of 
relevant tools and techniques which support 
the engineering process, and foundational approaches, pinpointing 
relevant framework thereby guiding the 
development process. 

The MEPP'93  seminar held in Mariehamn, AAland Islands (Finland), 
June 14-18, 1993,  drew the attention of 35 participants from Czech Republic, 
Finland, Germany, Hungary, Japan, and Spain. 
Seleced papers from MEPP '93 will appear in a 
Special Issue of the Fuzzy Sets and Systems.
