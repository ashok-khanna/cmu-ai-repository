                        PPCP'94 -- Call For Papers
 Second Workshop on the Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming
                               May 2-4, 1994
                       Orcas Island, Washington, USA


The Second Workshop on the Principles and Practice of Constraint
Programming will be an inter-disciplinary meeting focusing on constraint
programming and constraint-based systems.  Following the first workshop,
held in April 1993, the meeting will be small and informal, providing
forums for prepared presentations, panels, and discussions.  This workshop
is held in cooperation with the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence, and is sponsored in part by the Office of Naval Research.

Participation will be by invitation of the program committee, and will be
restricted primarily to authors of accepted papers. The program committee
solicits papers describing preliminary or completed research and new
directions or possible uses of constraint programming.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
  - constraint programming languages, including constraint logic programming,
    concurrent constraint programming, and constraint imperative programming:
      - semantics
      - compilation, including optimization and compile-time analysis
      - programming environments
      - applications
  - algorithms for constraint satisfaction and entailment
  - constraint problems and their relationship to:
      - artificial intelligence; automated reasoning; model-based reasoning
      - combinatorial optimization; scheduling
      - computational linguistics
      - computer algebra
      - concurrency
      - databases
      - graphics; solid and geometric modeling
      - hardware verification
      - logic programming
      - operations research; decision support systems
      - robotics; vision
      - scientific computing
      - software engineering; module interconnection frameworks
      - symbolic computation
      - user interfaces; human-computer interaction

The workshop will be held at Rosario Resort on Orcas Island.  Orcas Island
is one of the San Juan Islands, in northwestern Washington State, and is a
place of great natural beauty.  Rosario can be reached via various modes of
transportation, including seaplane from Seattle direct to the Rosario dock.

Authors are invited to submit (by hardcopy or e-mail postscript file) five
copies of a short paper, not exceeding 2000 words, by Wednesday January 12,
1994 to the program chair:
    Alan Borning
    Department of Computer Science & Engineering, FR-35
    University of Washington
    Seattle, Washington  98915

Below is a revised version of the call for papers for the workshop.  There
was an unfortunate error in the earlier version -- I had my zip code wrong
(postal code for Europeans).  Many apologies!  Please use the correct
version, shown below.  There are a few other changes as well, including
cooperation with the Association for Logic Programming and an additional
program committee member.
