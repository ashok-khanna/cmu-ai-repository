                         CALL FOR PAPERS

             2nd Annual EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON ALGORITHMS
                            (ESA'94)

           SEPTEMBER 26-28, 1994, UTRECHT - THE NETHERLANDS

In the new series of annual international symposia on algorithms, the
Second Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA'94) will be held
near Utrecht, The Netherlands, September 26-28, 1994. The European Symposium
on Algorithms covers ALL RESEARCH ON ALGORITHMS such as it is carried out in
the fields of (THEORETICAL) COMPUTER SCIENCE, DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS and
all OTHER AREAS of algorithm-oriented research AND ITS APPLICATION.
The Symposium aims at intensifying the exchange of information on new
research directions and at the presentation of recent research results
and their utilization in the field.

SCOPE: the Symposium covers ALL RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL
AND DISTRIBUTED ALGORITHMS and its application. Papers are solicited
describing original results in ALL FIELDS OF ALGORITHMS RESEARCH, both in
general and in specific areas such as: graph- and network problems,
computational geometry, algebraic problems and symbolic computation, pattern
matching, combinatorial optimization, neural and genetic computing,
cryptography, and so on. ESA also solicits papers describing original results
in ALGORITHMS RESEARCH APPLIED TO CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY or
dealing with new (algorithmic) issues arising in the implementation of
algorithms in real-world problems.

AUTHORS are invited to submit 12 copies of an extended abstract or full draft
paper of at most 12 pages before MARCH 25, 1994 to the chairman of the
program committee:
                    Professor Jan van Leeuwen

will be published in the proceedings of the Symposium, which will appear in
the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer-Verlag. Camera-ready
copy is due before June 20, 1994. All participants receive a copy of the
proceedings as part of their registration.
