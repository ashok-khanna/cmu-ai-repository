       Fifth International Workshop on Algorithmic Learning Theory 
                     Reinhardsbrunn Castle, Germany
                          October 13-15, 1994
   
The Fifth International Workshop on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT'94)
will be held at the Reinhardsbrunn Castle, Friedrichroda, Germany during
October 13-15, 1994.  The workshop will be supported by the German Computer
Science Society (GI) in cooperation with the Japanese Society for
Artificial Intelligence (JSAI) and it will be coupled with the Fourth 
International Workshop on Analogical and Inductive Inference for Program
Synthesis (AII'94), which will be held October 10-11.  We invite
submissions to ALT'94 from researchers in algorithmic learning or its
related fields, such as (but not limited to) the theory of machine
learning, computational logic of/for machine discovery, inductive
inference, query learning, learning by analogy, neural networks, pattern
recognition, and applications to databases, gene analysis, etc.  The
conference will include presentations of refereed papers and invited talks
by Dr. Naoki Abe from NEC, Prof. Michael M. Richter from Kaiserslautern and
Prof. Carl H. Smith from Maryland.

SUBMISSION. Authors must submit six copies of their extended abstracts to :
	Prof. Setsuo Arikawa - ALT'94 
	RIFIS, Kyushu University 33 
	Fukuoka 812, Japan 

Abstracts must be received by 
			April 15, 1994. 
Notification of acceptance or rejection will be mailed to the first (or
designated) author by June 1, 1994.  
Camera-ready copy of accepted papers will be due July 4, 1994.

FORMAT. The submitted abstract should consist of a cover page with
title, authors' names, postal and e-mail addresses, and an
approximately 200 word summary , and a body not longer than ten (10)
pages of size A4 or 7x10.5 inches in twelve-point font.  Papers not
adhering to this format may be returned without review.
Double-sided printing is strongly encouraged.

POLICY.  Each submitted abstract will be reviewed by at least four
members of the program committee, and be judged on clarity,
significance, and originality.  Submissions should contain new
results that have not been published previously.  Submissions to
ALT'94 may be submitted to AII'94, but if so a statement to this
effect must appear on the cover page or the first page.

Proceedings will be published as a volume in the Lecture Notes Series 
in Artificial Intelligence from Springer-Verlag, and some selected
papers will be included in a special issue of the Annals of Mathematics
and Artificial Intelligence.
