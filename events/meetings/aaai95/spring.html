		   REPRESENTING MENTAL STATES AND MECHANISMS

		       AAAI 1995 Spring Symposium Series
			      March 27 - 29, 1995
			     Stanford University,
			     Stanford, California
				       

			    CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


The ability to reason about  mental states and cognitive mechanisms facilitates
performance at a variety of tasks.  The purpose of this symposium is to enhance
our ability  to  construct programs that  employ  commonsense knowledge  of the
mental world in  an explicit representational format  that can be shared across
domains  and     systems.     Such knowledge    can,    for  example,    assist
story-understanding  programs to understand characters  that learn, forget, pay
attention, make a  decision, and  change their   mind.  The  need to  represent
knowledge of    mental activity transcends   usual disciplinary   boundaries to
include most  reasoning  tasks where systems  interact   with users, coordinate
behaviors with   autonomous   agents, or    consider  their own   beliefs   and
limitations.  For example, distributed problem-solving agents can use knowledge
of mental phenomena to predict and explain the  behavior of cooperating agents.
In machine learning, a system's knowledge  of its own mental states, capacities
and mechanisms crucially determines the  reliability with which it can diagnose
and  repair  reasoning failures.   The focus  of the  symposium, however, is on
representation   of  the  mental    world   and   the  sharing/reuse  of   such
representations,  rather than the     applications that  such   representations
support.

Important questions to consider:

 o  (SHARABILITY) What tools / techniques can facilitate the sharing of
    representations among researchers?

 o  (REUSE) What portions of  the representation  can  be  transferred
    across reasoning tasks?

 o  (ARCHITECTURE) How can functional models of reasoning-components be
    represented explicitly?

 o  (LOGICAL FORM) What statements can be logically asserted about  the
    self and its beliefs? What benefits arise from such representations?

 o  (APPLICATIONS) How can knowledge of  mental phenomena  be  used in
    tasks ranging  from student instruction to  intelligent  interface
    control?

 o  (INTROSPECTION) What must an intelligent  system know about its own
    mental states and processes?
