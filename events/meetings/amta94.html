                          AMTA Conference 1994:
                Partnerships in Translation Technology
                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) is
organizing its first full-fledged conference, to be held on 6-8
October 1994 at the Columbia Inn in Columbia, Maryland.  The overall
intent of the conference is to bring MT researchers, developers, and
users to share the latest information on MT and forge partnerships for
addressing the challenge of language barriers that impede communication
on the information highway.  The program is designed to offer something
for everyone who has an interest in MT and, by so doing, to cultivate
contacts between users and developers and between developers and
researchers.  It is also intended to set the stage for stronger
partnerships between AMTA and the other regions of the International
Association for Machine Translation (IAMT).

The conference will cover a broad range of MT topics through panels,
papers, demonstrations, and exhibits over three days of sessions.
Preliminary tutorials on intellectual property rights in the MT field
and on matching up MT users and MT environments are being planned for
5 October.

We expect to have sessions on the following areas:

PC MT systems		Assessing translatability     Knowledge-based MT
Workstation MT systems	Current Solutions	  Statistical MT
Translator Workstations	MT Evaluation		  Corpus cooperation
MT & desktop publishing	Speech MT		  Future directions in MT
MT economics		Assessment of MT needs	  MT System demonstrations


We invite papers on any of these topics.  Extended abstracts (up to ten
pages) are due by July 8; authors will be notified of acceptance by
mid-August.  Submissions should be sent to Eduard Hovy at the address
below; electronic submissions in plain ASCII format are encouraged, and
should be sent to hovy@isi.edu.

		        AMTA-94:
  "Technology Partnerships for Crossing the Language Barrier"
		  Columbia, Maryland
		   5-8 October 1994

      SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) is
proud to announce its first regular conference, to be held on 6-8 October
1994 at the Columbia Inn in Columbia, Maryland. Focusing on the theme
"Technology Partnerships for Crossing the Language Barrier," AMTA-94
will bring together users, vendors, developers, and researchers to hear
about the latest developments in machine translation (MT) and related
technology. In so doing, it will set the stage for partnerships to meet
today's challenges in interlingual communication.  Concurrent sessions
will offer something for everyone--and pose hard choices. Along with a rich
variety of exhibits and demonstrations running throughout the conference,
panels and presentations on 6-8 October will cover:

PC MT Systems                                      MT Evaluation
Workstation MT Systems                             Speech MT
Translator Workstations                            Assessment of MT Needs
MT & Desktop Publishing                            Knowledge-based MT
MT economics                                       Statistical MT
Assessing Translatability                          Dictionaries and MT
Current Solutions                                  Corpus Cooperation
                          Future Directions in MT

Some of these topics will also be the subject of special interest groups.
In addition, preconference tutorials on 5 October will take a look at
"Choosing an MT System" and "Intellectual Property Rights."

Participation in all these areas is invited. Suggestions and proposals
for papers (extended abstracts up to 10 pages) or panels should be
submitted in electronic form to Eduard Hovy, Program Co-chair, at
hovy@isi.edu. The deadline for papers has been extended to 15 July;
authors will be notified of acceptance by mid-August. Proposals for
demonstrations and exhibits should be addressed to Bill Fry,
Exhibits and Demonstrations Coordinator, fax (703) 998-5709.

"Technology Partnerships for Crossing the Language Barrier"

The first conference of the Association for Machine Translation in 
the Americas (AMTA), organized around the theme "Technology 
Partnerships," aims to fulfill AMTA's twofold commitment: to 
share the latest information in the dynamic areas of machine 
translation (MT) and machine-assisted translation (MAT), and, 
at the same time, to encourage all who are interested in translation 
technology--actual and potential users, vendors, developers, 
researchers--to focus on ways in which they can team up to 
improve communication across language barriers.
