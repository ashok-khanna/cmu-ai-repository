Coling '94 Tutorial

Research in computational linguistics is a well developed field.  The
production of more and more useful results and increased applicability
to real languages is improving development within the field as well as
its position overall. The complexities of natural language, affected
by both culture and society, cannot be comprehended using only one
approach. Computational linguistics research reflects this, the
current growth in research has gone beyond one simple paradigm to
embrace research in such fields as example and corpus based statistical
methods, and those related to the structure of human recognition and
multimedia. In the COLING '94 tutorials, we have tried to give a wide
and useful view of the current state of computational linguistics,
with six sessions in three days.  The lecturers are world leaders in
their fields. We hope that many people are able to attend, not only
researchers and students, but also people involved with development
and planning in this ever expanding field.
