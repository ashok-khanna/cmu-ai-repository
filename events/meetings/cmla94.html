AIM OF THE WORKSHOP
The workshop is centered around two basic questions with respect to
the nature and origins of language as "an individual phenomenon":

  (1) What constitutes knowledge of language?

  (2) How is knowledge of language acquired?

Currently, these questions are being addressed within different 
cognitive models of language acquisition which derive from strongly 
contrasting research paradigms. The paradigms start from fundamentally 
different assumptions about language (symbolic or subsymbolic) and 
the mechanisms that drive the process of language acquisition 
(inductive or deductive). 

The workshop will focus on processes of language acquisition in children 
and adults and on modelling theses processes. In particular, the 
acquisition and representation of words will be a central topic. The 
workshop aims to bring together researchers willing to discuss the merits 
and constraints of the various models based on the interdisciplinary 
approaches of linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, NLP, and AI.
