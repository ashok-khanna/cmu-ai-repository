CLNL'93 is the fourth of an ongoing series of workshops designed to bring
together researchers from a diverse set of disciplines --- including
  computational learning theory, AI/machine learning,
  connectionist learning, statistics, and control theory ---
to explore issues at the intersection of theoretical learning research
and natural learning systems.

    Scaling Up Machine Learning:  Practical and Theoretical Issues

                         Thomas G. Dietterich
                     Oregon State University and
                   Arris Pharmaceutical Corporation


Supervised learning methods are being applied to an ever-expanding
range of problems.  This talk will review issues arising in these
applications that require further research.  The issues can be
organized according to the problem-solving task, the form of the
inputs and outputs, and any constraints or prior knowledge that must
be considered.  For example, the learning task often involves
extrapolating beyond the training data in ways that are not addressed
in current theory or engineering experience.  As another example, each
training example may be represented by a disjunction of feature
vectors, rather than a unique feature vector as is usually assumed.
More generally, each training example may correspond to a manifold of
feature vectors.  As a third example, background knowledge may take
the form of constraints that must be satisfied by any hypothesis
output by a learning algorithm.  The issues will be illustrated using
examples from several applications including recent work in
computational drug design and ecosystem modelling.

		Current Tree Research

		   Leo Breiman
	     Deptartment of Statistics
         University of California, Berkeley

This talk will summarize current research by myself and collaborators
into methods of enhancing tree methodology.  The topics covered will be:

1)  Tree optimization
2)  Forming features
3)  Regularizing trees
4)  Multiple response trees
5)  Hyperplane trees

These research areas are in a simmer.  They have been programmed and
are undergoing testing.  The results are diverse.

  Siemens Corporate Research	and	MIT Laboratory of Computer Science

================  ** CLNL'93 Logistics **  =======================

Dates:
  The workshop begins at 9am Friday 10/Sept, and concludes by 3pm
   Sunday 12/Sept, in time to catch the 3:30pm Provincetown--Boston ferry.

Location:
  All sessions will take place in the Provincetown Inn (800 942-5388); we
  encourage registrants to stay there.   Provincetown Massachusetts is located
  at the very tip of Cape Cod, jutting into the Atlantic Ocean.

Transportation:
  We have rented a ship from  The Portuguese Princess  to transport CLNL'93
  registrants from Boston to Provincetown on Thursday 9/Sept/93, at no charge
  to the registrants.  We will also supply light munchies en route.  This ship
  will depart from the back of Boston Harbor Hotel, 70 Rowes Wharf on Atlantic
  Avenue (parking garage is 617 439-0328); tentatively at 6:30pm.
  If you are interested in using this service, please let us know ASAP (via
  e-mail to clnl93@learning.scr.siemens.com) and  also tell us whether you be
  able to make the scheduled 6:30pm departure.

  (N.b., this service replaces the earlier proposal, which involved the
  Bay State Cruise Lines.)

  The drive from Boston to Provincetown requires approximately two hours.
  There are cabs, busses, ferries and commuter airplanes (CapeAir, 800 352-0714)
  that service this Boston--Provincetown route.
  The Hyannis/Plymouth bus (508 746-0378) leaves Logan Airport at 8:45am,
  11:45am, 2:45pm, 4:45pm on weekdays, and arrives in Provincetown about
  4 hours later; its cost is $24.25.
  For the return trip (only), Bay State Cruise Lines (617 723-7800) runs a
  ferry that departs Provincetown at 3:30pm on Sundays, arriving at
  Commonwealth Pier in Boston Harbor at 6:30pm; its cost is $15/person, one way.
