3rd Logic Programming and Non-Monotonic Reasoning Conference
Lexington, KY, USA
June 26-28, 1995

This is the third in the series of international meetings 
on the relationship between logic programming and 
non-monotonic reasoning. Two previous meetings were held 
in Washington, DC, in 1991, and in Lisbon, 
Portugal, in 1993. The series was started in response to the growing
evidence of synergy between the two areas and was meant as a vehicle
to facilitate interactions and interdisciplinary research.

Papers are invited on all aspects of logic programming and  
non-monotonic reasoning. Papers on the relationship between 
logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning are especially encouraged.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics of interest:

+ Semantics for logic programs + Default logic and its versions
+ Modal non-monotonic logics + Non-monotonic rule systems + Abduction
+ Diagnosis + Non-monotonic reasoning in databases + Theory of 
updates and belief revision + Constraint satisfaction + Algorithms 
and complexity + Implementations and applications
