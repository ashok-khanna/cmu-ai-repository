		     CALL FOR PAPERS --- PEPM'94

		       ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
     Partial Evaluation and Semantics-Based Program Manipulation

			    June 25, 1994
			   Orlando, Florida
	       (Held in conjunction with PLDI and LFP)


The theme of the workshop is partial evaluation and other techniques
for automatic analysis and transformation of programs.  Such
techniques promise to assist in developing efficient and reliable
programs.  Examples are: automatic specialization of general programs,
and transformation of obviously correct but inefficient programs into
more efficient programs.

Typical relevant topics are: program transformation, program
specialization, partial evaluation, mixed computation, super-
compilation, abstract interpretation, static analysis, binding-time 
analysis, generalization, staging, memoization, compiler generation.

Original results that bear upon these topics are solicited.  In
particular, we encourage reports of the following three kinds:

* Experience with applications (for instance, scientific
  computing, parsing and pattern matching, semantics-directed compiler
  generation, programming environments, debugging, incremental
  computation, meta-programming, and prototyping).

* Comparison of the program manipulation techniques used for
  different types of programming languages (such as functional,
  logical, imperative, object oriented, and concurrent languages).

* Comparison of these techniques with more traditional programming
  and computer science concepts.

Send your submission by electronic mail to *both* program chairs in
the form of a Postscript file or a self-contained TeX or LaTeX file.
If this is impossible, send 4 printed copies to Peter Sestoft,
Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark,
Building 344, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.

Submissions must be received on or before February 7, 1994, must
include return mail and email addresses, and should be at most 10
pages long.  Papers will be judged on relevance, significance,
correctness and clarity, and must include an abstract and discussion
of related work.

Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings.  These will be
distributed at the workshop and will subsequently be available as a
technical report from the University of Melbourne, Australia.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN '94
Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI
'94) and the 1994 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming
(LFP '94).
