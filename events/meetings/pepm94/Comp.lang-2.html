2:  REGISTRATION INFORMATION

The registration fee is USD 70 for ACM and/or SIGPLAN members, and USD
80 for non-members.  Registration forms and hotel reservation forms
can be obtained by ftp from speedy.cs.pitt.edu:pub/pldi94/

>From comp.lang.sigplan on March 24:

    ATTENTION all SIGPLAN June'94 Conference Attendees:

    If you are going to attend PLDI'94, LFP'94 and/or one of their three
    associated workshops (PEPM, ML, Real-time), it is imperative that you
    make your hotel reservations at the meeting hotel, the Hilton at Walt
    Disney World Village, as soon as possible.  The hotel has informed us
    that World Cup Soccer is coming to Orlando during the same weeks as
    our meetings; this will cause the hotel to release our block of rooms
    to World Cup attendees (at much higher prices, we expect), as soon as
    our reservation deadline of May 27,1994 is passed.

    Please make your hotel reservations as soon as possible to be assured
    of the publicized conference rates. The reservation number is
    1-800-782-4414, or you can fax the registration form (obtainable at
    our ftp site on speedy.cs.pitt.edu) to 1-407-827-3890.
