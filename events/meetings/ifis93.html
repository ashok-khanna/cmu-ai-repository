design; and Hardware and development environments for fuzzy control 
with hands-on demonstration.

II. Advanced Topics in Fuzzy Technology
The objective of the advanced tutorial is to introduce the state-of-the-art in 
fuzzy technology to industrial researchers and practitioners who have a 
basic understanding of fuzzy logic and fuzzy control.
Topics to be covered include: Analytical issues; Fuzzy logic and 
supervisory control; Fuzzy neuro control; Fuzzy pattern classification: 
Application in control and diagnostics; and   Fuzzy optimization and 
multi-objective decision making.

Instructors
Professor Reza Langari specializes in both theory and applications of 
fuzzy logic control and has delivered lectures and tutorials on this subject 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, American Control Conference, and other 
research and academic institutions in the U.S.

Professor John Yen is active in the area of fuzzy logic control and has 
given seminars and tutorials on the subject at Motorola, Boeing, ITESM, 
and other industrial and academic institutions.

Professor Mohammad Jamshidi is Director of the Computer-Aided 
Design Laboratory for Intelligent Robotic Systems at the University of 
New Mexico and holds the AT&T professorship for manufacturing 
engineering. He teaches courses on fuzzy logic and its applications and
