                       August 8-12, 1994


** Last Call for Workshop proposals - deadline November 1, 1993 **


The European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) is the
European forum for scientific exchange and presentation of AI
research. The aim of the conference is to cover all aspects of AI
research and to bring together basic research and applied research.
The Technical Programme will include paper presentations, invited
talks, panels, workshops, and tutorials. The conference is designed to
cover all subfields of AI, including non-symbolic methods.

ECAIs are held in alternate years and are organized by the European
Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI). The 11th
ECAI in 1994 will be hosted by the Dutch AI Society (NVKI). The
conference will take place at the Amsterdam RAI, International
Exhibition and Congress Centre.

 
                      W O R K S H O P S

A full workshop programme is planned for ECAI '94. These will take
place in the two days immediately before the main technical
conference, i.e., on August 8 and 9, 1994. Workshops may last for
either 1 or 2 days.

They will give participants the opportunity to discuss specific
technical topics in a small, informal environment, which encourages
interaction and exchange of ideas. Workshops may address any topic
covered by the list of areas that has been identified in the Call for
Papers. The list is included at the end of this article. Workshops on
applications and related issues are especially welcome. Workshop
proposals should be in the form of a draft call for participation
containing a brief description of the workshop and the technical
issues to be addressed, the proposed format and the kind of
contributions solicited, and the names and addresses (postal, phone,
fax, e-mail) of the organizing committee of the
workshop. Additionally, proposals should specify the number of
expected participants and some names of some potential participants.
Proposers are encouraged to send their draft proposal to potential
participants for comments before submission.

The organizers of accepted workshops are responsible for producing a
call for participation, for reviewing requests to participate and
for scheduling the workshop activities within the constraints set by
the conference organizers.

Workshop proposals should be sent to the Workshop Chairpersons as soon
as possible, but not later than November 1, 1993. Electronic
submission (plain ascii text) is highly preferred, but hard copy
submission is also accepted in which case 5 copies should be
submitted. Proposals should not exceed 2 sides of A4 (i.e.,
approximately 120 lines of text). The proposals will be reviewed by
the Programme Committee and the organizers will be notified not later
than December 31, 1993.

Details of all accepted workshops will be available by anonymous FTP
from cs.vu.nl, directory ECAI94 by January 31, 1994; alternatively
send electronic mail to ecai94-workshops@cs.vu.nl. It should be
noted that registration for the main conference will be required in
order to attend an ECAI '94 workshop.

P A P E R S

You are invited to submit an original research paper that represents a
significant contribution to any aspect of AI, including the principles
underlying cognition, perception, and action in humans and machines;
the design, application, and evaluation of AI algorithms and
intelligent systems; and the analysis of tasks and domains in which
intelligent systems perform. Theoretical and experimental results are
equally welcome. Papers describing innovative ideas are especially
sought providing such papers include substantial analysis of the
ideas, the technology needed to realize them, and their potential
impact.

Of special interest this year are papers which address applied AI. Two
kinds of papers are sought. The first category is case studies of AI
applications that address significant real-world problems and which
are used outside the AI community itself; these papers must justify
the use of the AI technique, explain how the AI technology contributed
to the solution and was integrated with other components, and most
importantly explain WHY the application was successful (or perhaps why
it failed) -- these "lessons learned" will be the most important
review criteria.  The second category is for papers on novel AI
techniques and principles that may enable more ambitious real-world
applications. All the usual AI topics are appropriate. These papers
must describe the importance of the approach from an application
context, in sufficient technical detail and clarity, and clearly and
thoroughly differentiate the work from previous efforts. There will be
special prizes for the best papers in both these areas. In addition to
these prizes, a prize for the best paper as determined by the
Programme Committee will be awarded; the Digital Equipment Prize and a
prize for the best paper from Eastern Europe will also be awarded.

Details of the requirements and format for the submission of papers
can be found in the call for papers, obtainable from the Conference
Office or by anonymous FTP from agora.leeds.ac.uk, file:
ECAI94/cfp.txt. Papers must be received by the Programme Chairperson
no later than January 8, 1994.


PANELS

Proposals for panel discussions (up to 1000 words) should be sent
to the Programme Chairperson by February 8, 1994. E-mail is
preferred.


VIDEO SUBMISSIONS

Videos unaccompanied by papers may be submitted for presentation
in special video track sessions. The purpose of these videos
should be to demonstrate the current levels of usefulness of AI
tools, techniques and methods. Videos presenting research arising
out of interesting real-world applications are especially sought.
Details of how to submit a video tape are given in the full
version of the call for papers available from the Conference
Office or by anonymous ftp from agora.leeds.ac.uk, file:
ECAI94/cfp.txt. The deadline for submission is the same as that
for papers.

kinds of papers are sought. The first category is case studies of AI
applications that address significant real-world problems and which
are used outside the AI community itself; these papers must justify
the use of the AI technique, explain how the AI technology contributed
to the solution and was integrated with other components, and most
importantly explain WHY the application was successful (or perhaps why
it failed) -- these "lessons learned" will be the most important
review criteria.  The second category is for papers on novel AI
techniques and principles that may enable more ambitious real-world
applications. All the usual AI topics are appropriate. These papers
must describe the importance of the approach from an application
context, in sufficient technical detail and clarity, and clearly and
thoroughly differentiate the work from previous efforts. There will be
special prizes for the best papers in both these areas. In addition to
these prizes, a prize for the best paper as determined by the
Programme Committee will be awarded; the Digital Equipment Prize and a
prize for the best paper from Eastern Europe will also be awarded.

Details of the requirements and format for the submission of papers
can be found in the call for papers, obtainable from the Conference
Office or by anonymous FTP from agora.leeds.ac.uk, file:
ECAI94/cfp.txt. Papers must be received by the Programme Chairperson
no later than January 8, 1994.


PANELS

Proposals for panel discussions (up to 1000 words) should be sent
to the Programme Chairperson by February 8, 1994. E-mail is
preferred.


VIDEO SUBMISSIONS

Videos unaccompanied by papers may be submitted for presentation
in special video track sessions. The purpose of these videos
should be to demonstrate the current levels of usefulness of AI
tools, techniques and methods. Videos presenting research arising
out of interesting real-world applications are especially sought.
Details of how to submit a video tape are given in the full
version of the call for papers available from the Conference
Office or by anonymous ftp from agora.leeds.ac.uk, file:
ECAI94/cfp.txt. The deadline for submission is the same as that
for papers.

ECAI94 Workshop 
MODELS AND TECHNIQUES FOR REUSE OF DESIGNS
Monday 8 August 1994

The design of objects is a very complex process which is hard to
formalize due to the lack of an all encompassing theory of
design. When observing designers in practice, it has been concluded
that a large part of their activities consists of reusing design
experiences. Such experiences are related to earlier design situations
and existing design products, many of which have been proven useful in
practice.  Several research groups are currently investigating
possibilities for formalizing and codifying this experience for reuse
in new design problems.

Two major research areas can be distinguished. Firstly, existing
designs are adapted to meet new demands. The focus in such situations
is to determine parts that need to be adapted to satisfy new
requirements. These requirements may be related to the function,
physical properties of the design, or life-cycle aspects, such as
serviceability and costs. The second research area focuses on finding
existing designs that can be reused in new design problems.  Difficult
issues here include developing suitable index structures and
similarity measures.  In both research areas, models and techniques
have to be developed for structuring and representing existing designs
so that they can be reused in new situations. Furthermore, design
reuse is a relevant concept for both routine and innovative design.

In the workshop we would like to focus on methods and techniques to
support the reuse of existing design knowledge, especially methods and
techniques that have the potential to be useful in practical design
situations. The workshop is intended for researchers working in the
field of redesign and case-based reasoning in engineering domains.

The questions to be addressed are:
. What is needed to find similar designs?
. What is needed to find analogous designs?
. How can the part of the design that needs to be adapted be
  found?
. How can the complexity of the adaptation needed be determined?
. How can the consequences of the changes be determined?
. How must past design knowledge be structured and represented to
  be reusable?
. How can adaptation of designs be supported?

The outcome of the workshop may be an inventory of promising methods
and techniques for supporting case-based reasoning and redesign in
different design situations.

Workshop format: 
The workshop will last one day: Monday, August 8, 1994.  
To facilitate discussion, the number of attendees at the
workshop will be limited to 30. The discussion will be centered around
challenging statements to be presented by a selected number of
participants.  Each participant must register for both the workshop
and the general conference.

ECAI-94 WORKSHOP CALL FOR PAPERS / CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

VALIDATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS


Validation has emerged as a critical factor in the acceptance of knowledge-
based systems (KBS) software. Users will not have confidence in a system 
unless they are satisfied that it has been validated thoroughly. 
Unfortunately, by their very nature, KBS are difficult to validate: a 
typical KBS is required to solve a complex, ill-structured problem, for 
which there may be no certain, "acceptable" solution; consequently, it will 
be hard to decide if the KBS performs acceptably. The validation of KBS has 
become a significant area of research in recent years, resulting in a number 
of workshops held at ECAI, IJCAI and AAAI conferences. The chief objectives 
of the workshops have been: to assess the growing level of maturity in the 
field, to identify areas of primary concern, to develop specific tools and 
techniques, and to establish project-management strategies for the 
successful development and deployment of reliable KBS. These workshops have 
proven instrumental in advancing the state-of-the-art and (albeit more 
slowly) the start-of-the-practice in the domain of validation. 

To foster this trend, at ECAI-94 we propose to focus upon four themes: 

FORMAL VALIDATION These techniques are concerned with modelling the KBS 
using some formalism, from which it is possible to prove desirable 
properties of the system. While much work has been done here in the area of 
verifying rule-based domain knowledge with respect to generic properties 
such as inconsistency, redundancy, and incompleteness, there are still many 
unsolved problems, including: 
- verification of uncertain knowledge;
- verification of control knowledge;
- development of adequate theoretical foundations for verification; 
- development of efficient verification algorithms. 

EMPIRICAL VALIDATION These techniques are concerned with obtaining, through 
experimentation, evidence as to the behaviour of the KBS, and deciding 
whether the system is acceptable on the basis of the evidence. Work done in 
this area includes the development of testing strategies (random, structural 
and functional), statistical metrics, and psychological evaluation methods. 
Notable outstanding problems include the following: 
- deciding how much testing to do;
- providing software support for the onerous testing process; 
- evaluating the effectiveness of different testing techniques; 
- comparing the capabilities of formal and empirical validation processes. 

HYBRID VALIDATION Increasingly, it is becoming unrealistic to consider KBS 
validation in a vacuum: on one hand, many software systems are now hybrid, 
blending KBS technology with other AI and conventional technologies (notably 
neural nets and object-oriented programming). 

INTEGRATED VALIDATION This theme considers the development of methodologies 
to support effective validation, including requirements specification, 
acquisition of knowledge specifically for validation, and life-cycle 
management. This theme also considers the integration of validation with 
other difficult development processes, including knowledge acquisition, 
knowledge representation, knowledge refinement/learning, and system 
maintenance.

Within any of these themes, papers having either a theoretical or practical 
flavour are equally welcome: we are especially interested in papers that 
combine theory and practice.


FORMAT

Sessions will include include a blend of regular-length paper presentations 
and panel sessions, depending upon the submitted material. Each session will 
be lead by a selected "discussant", who will provoke and encourage audience 
participation in a discussion period following the session. 


ATTENDANCE

The workshop is limited to 35 participants to encourage in-depth discussion 
of topics. Participants will be chosen by the program committee on the basis 
of: (a) submitted materials; or (b) active interest in the validation 
domain.


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Participants are invited to submit either a technical paper (not to exceed 
12 double-spaced pages) or an extended (1-2 page) abstract; the submitted 
work should not have previously been published.  Since workshop attendance 
will be limited, participants with an active interest in KBS validation who 
wish to attend the workshop but cannot submit a paper should provide a short 
"statement of interest".


DEADLINES

Papers and abstracts, should be mailed so as to arrive no later than FRIDAY 
APRIL 29.

Statements of interest (for those wishing to attend but unable to submit a 
paper or abstract) should arrive no later than FRIDAY JUNE 17.

Materials may be submitted by email, FAX, or regular mail.  For email, plain 
ASCII, self-contained TeX, or PostScript only are acceptable.  For regular 
mail, please send THREE COPIES.

In case of acceptance, final camera-ready versions of papers or abstracts 
must arrive no later than FRIDAY JUNE 17.

The workshop proceedings will be produced by ECAI for distribution to 
workshop attendees, and limited sale to other conference attendees.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

ECAI-94 WORKSHOP ON 
APPLIED GENETIC AND OTHER EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
Amsterdam, August 9, 1994

One of the reasons for the growing interest in genetic and other 
evolutionary algorithms is their good performance on a wide scale 
of problems. However, practical applications may raise issues 
beyond the scope of classical models. The goal of this workshop is 
to cumulate knowledge on the application of EAs and in particular 
to study changes to and extensions of the standard approaches. 
Topics of interest include but are not restricted to:

o problem elicitation and representation,
o non-standard genotypes and recombination operators,
o genetic programming,
o handling constraints,
o boosting performance,
o combination with other techniques, e.g. local search, neural nets,
  knowledge based systems,
o advantages and disadvantages of EAs w.r.t. other techniques.

About 10-12 of the participants will have the opportunity to 
introduce his/her work in the form of a short presentation. Other 
persons interested in the subject may also participate in a limited
number. Besides the presentations, substantial time will be allocated
for discussion and comparison of the presented results. Our hope is 
that insights gained at the workshop may facilitate further 
applications and support new theory. 

SUBMISSIONS
Two kinds of contributions are invited 

o papers that describe successful practical applications,
o papers investigating relevant issues by extensive test sessions on 
  a test bench.

In both cases the problem(s) to be solved and the issue(s) to be 
investigated should be clearly described followed by the system 
description and  experiment setup. Evaluation of the system and 
analysis of the test results should be given to support the 
conclusions.

Three camera ready copies of a full paper not exceeding 12 pages 
(12 point font, single space) including figures and references 
should be sent to

Submission of the PostScript format by e-mail is also possible. 
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings 
available at the workshop. In the meantime, the organizers aim 
at publication in a special journal issue or book containing the 
revised versions of the best papers.

Persons willing to attend the workshop without a presentation
should submit a brief description of their research area or field 
of interest. Deadlines for submission and notification are the same 
as for papers for presentation.

	Formal Specification Methods for Knowledge-Based Systems

			August 8, 1994

	--------------------------------------------------------
	--------------------------------------------------------

Formal specification languages have become an important research topic
in the development of knowledge-based systems. This workshop focuses
on the formal semantics of the specification languages. It aims at a
better understanding of the various types of semantics for these
languages, within the context of their use as a tool for development
of knowledge based systems. Specific technical areas include:

o	denotational and operational semantics and their relationships
o	integration of compotational semantics and global semantics
o	semantics of static knowledge and procedural behaviour
o	tools for development of formal specifications
o	axiomatization and proof theories
o	validation and verification of formal specifications
o	verification of a system with respect to a formal specification
o	test generation, simulation, prototyping, symbolic execution etc.

A specific aim of this workshop is to compare the work done by the
knowledge engineering community with results achieved by other communities.
We explicitly ask people from knowledge representation, software
engineering, information systems and deductive data bases to join this
workshop.

Format and Kind of Contributions

Contributions are invited that present original, unpublished results in
the area of formal specification methods for knowledge based systems.
Submitted papers must not exceed 15 pages of single spaced, 11 pt. text,
including abstract and bibliography. Theoretical and position papers will be
judged on their originality and contribution to the field, and applied papers
on the importance and originality of the application. The workshop
organisers aim for publication of a book containing all accepted papers.

Time Table

Papers must be received by the workshop organisers no later than April 25,
1994. Acceptance letter will be posted no later than May 23, 1994. Final
camera-ready versions of the paper must be received by June 10, 1994. The
workshop will take place at August 8, 1994.

   with different  aspects of constraint processing  regarded as a  general
   paradigm  of computation.  However, the constraint processing  community
   appears to be  very heterogeneous:   Researchers from logic programming,
   knowledge representation,  expert systems, theoretical computer science,
   operations research  and other  related fields are investigating the use
   of constraint processing methods, their theoretical foundations, as well
   as their applications  to real-life problems.  Each of these communities
   has its own subgroup dealing with constraint processing issues,  some of
   them with specialized meetings, workshops, mailing lists etc. But, up to
   now there has not been much effort to bring together researchers working
   on or interested in constraint processing  from different viewpoints and
   to work out the common principles,  vocabulary,  and techniques that are
   used as well as similarities and differences between various viewpoints.

     Continuing the efforts  that started with the  workshop on  constraint
   processing at CSAM'93 in St. Petersburg (Russia) on July 20th-21st, 1993
   this workshop aims at bringing together researchers working on different
   aspects  of  constraint  processing  in order  to exchange,  compare and
   contrast  basic  viewpoints,  different  approaches and  recent research
   results.  Thus, the workshop is planned  as an interdisciplinary meeting
   of  researchers as well as practitioners with an  active interest in the
   area of constraint processing. It will provide an international forum to
   discuss and exchange  new ideas and approaches,  and to present not only
   full-blown research papers but also partial results, position papers and
   reports on ongoing research. By that, it is hoped that a fruitful cross-
   fertilization among the various disciplines will result.

     Work on all different aspects of constraint processing  is of specific
   interest for the workshop, including

     *  constraint-satisfaction methods and consistency techniques,
     *  constraint logic programming,
     *  concurrent constraint languages,
     *  constraints and knowledge representation,
     *  object-oriented constraint processing,
     *  constraint programming,
     *  constraint maintenance,
     *  constraints identification, specification, management and
        implementation techniques,
     *  over-specified constraint problems and constraint relaxation,
     *  creation and execution of constraint-satisfaction plans,
     *  constraint refinement,
     *  hierarchical constraint problems,
     *  parallel and distributed computing with constraints,
     *  finite (discrete) as well as continous domain handling,
     *  real-time constraints,
     *  relations to operations research or deductive databases,
     *  constraint processing in computer graphics,
     *  theoretical foundations,
     *  complexity results, and
     *  reports showing the practical relevance of constraint processing
	and what basic techniques are needed in practice.

   WORKSHOP FORMAT

     The workshop is planned as a combination of presentations of submitted
   papers and a round-table discussion that shall stimulate the exchange of
   new ideas and approaches among the workshop participants.

                                     Call for Papers


   	         COMBINING SYMBOLIC AND CONNECTIONIST PROCESSING

	            Workshop held in conjunction with ECAI-94
                   August 9, 1994 - Amsterdam, The Netherlands



   Until a  few years ago,  the history of AI has been marked by  two  parallel,
   often  antagonistic  streams of development -- classical or symbolic  AI  and
   connectionist  processing.   A  recent  research  trend,   premissed  on  the
   complementarity  of  these  two paradigms, strives to  build  hybrid  systems
   which  combine  the advantages of both to overcome the limitations  of  each.
   For instance, attempts have been made to accomplish complex tasks by blending
   neural networks with rule-based or case-based reasoning.  This workshop  will
   be the first  Europe-wide effort to bring together researchers active in  the
   area  in  view  of  laying  the  groundwork  for  a theory and methodology of
   symbolic/connectionist integration (SCI).

   The workshop will focus on the following topics:

      o   theoretical (cognitive and computational) foundations of SCI

      o   techniques and mechanisms for combining  symbolic and neural
          processing methods  (e.g. ways of improving and going beyond
          state-of-the-art rule compilation and extraction techniques)

      o   outstanding problems encountered  and issues involved in SCI
          (e.g. Which symbolic or connectionist representation schemes
          are best adapted to SCI? The vector space used in neural nets
          and the symbolic space have fundamental mathematical differ-
          ences; how will these differences impact SCI? Do we have the
          conceptual  tools  needed  to cope with this  representation
          problem?)

      o   profiles of application domains in which SCI has been (or can
          be) shown to perform better than traditional approaches

      o   description, analysis and comparison of implemented symbolic/
          connectionist systems


   SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

   Prospective participants should submit an extended abstract to the contact
   person below,  either via email in postscript format  or via regular mail,
   in which case three copies are required.  Each submission should include a
   separate information page containing the title of the paper,  author names
   and affiliations, and the complete address  (including telephone,  fax and
   email)  of the first author.  The paper itself should not exceed 12 pages.
   Submission deadline is April 1, 1994.

   Each  paper  will  be  reviewed  by  at  least  two members of the Program
   Committee.  Notification  of acceptance or rejection will be sent to first
   authors by May 1, 1994.  Camera-ready copies of accepted papers are due on
   June 1st and will be reproduced for distribution at the workshop.

   Those who wish  to participate  without  presenting a paper  should send a
   request  describing their  research interests  and/or previous work in the
   field of SCI.  Since attendance will be limited to ensure effective inter-
   action,  these requests will be considered  after screening  of  submitted
   papers.  All  workshop participants  are required to register for the main
   conference.

MODELS AND TECHNIQUES FOR REUSE OF DESIGNS
Monday 8 August 1994

The design of objects is a very complex process which is hard to
formalize due to the lack of an all encompassing theory of
design. When observing designers in practice, it has been concluded
that a large part of their activities consists of reusing design
experiences. Such experiences are related to earlier design situations
and existing design products, many of which have been proven useful in
practice.  Several research groups are currently investigating
possibilities for formalizing and codifying this experience for reuse
in new design problems.

Two major research areas can be distinguished. Firstly, existing
designs are adapted to meet new demands. The focus in such situations
is to determine parts that need to be adapted to satisfy new
requirements. These requirements may be related to the function,
physical properties of the design, or life-cycle aspects, such as
serviceability and costs. The second research area focuses on finding
existing designs that can be reused in new design problems.  Difficult
issues here include developing suitable index structures and
similarity measures.  In both research areas, models and techniques
have to be developed for structuring and representing existing designs
so that they can be reused in new situations. Furthermore, design
reuse is a relevant concept for both routine and innovative design.

In the workshop we would like to focus on methods and techniques to
support the reuse of existing design knowledge, especially methods and
techniques that have the potential to be useful in practical design
situations. The workshop is intended for researchers working in the
field of redesign and case-based reasoning in engineering domains.

The questions to be addressed are:
. What is needed to find similar designs?
. What is needed to find analogous designs?
. How can the part of the design that needs to be adapted be
  found?
. How can the complexity of the adaptation needed be determined?
. How can the consequences of the changes be determined?
. How must past design knowledge be structured and represented to
  be reusable?
. How can adaptation of designs be supported?

The outcome of the workshop may be an inventory of promising methods
and techniques for supporting case-based reasoning and redesign in
different design situations.

Workshop format:
The workshop will last one day: Monday, August 8, 1994.
To facilitate discussion, the number of attendees at the
workshop will be limited to 30. The discussion will be centered around
challenging statements to be presented by a selected number of
participants.  Each participant must register for both the workshop

                	Logic and Change


                 	Workshop at ECAI-94
                        August 8 -- 12, 1994,
                        Amsterdam, The Netherlands



The theme of the workshop is the confrontation of different approaches
to the declarative representation of change in intelligent systems.
Possible topics of contributions might be the following, however, the
list is not exhaustive:

 + Relevance and Change
 + Causality  and Change
 + Requirements for a formal approach to Action
 + Foundational approach to revision
 + Conditional logic and change
 + Syntactical versus semantical views of change
 + Abduction and Change
 + Nonmonotonicity and Change


We emphasize especially contributions concerning the relationship
between different approaches.  Since we want to benefit from the
informal character of a workshop, we are less interested in special
research papers of this field and we are more interested in papers
that focus on fundamental issues which may reach from a critical
assessment of current research trends to guidelines and perspectives
for future research.
We would also like to encourage contributions which shed a light on
the specific problems which arise when an approach is confronted with
applications.


Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-5 pages) or a
full paper in English by electronic mail (postscript file or
tex-dvifile) or alternatively 4 hard copies. The submitted papers will
be refereed by the workshop organisors.  Copies of the accepted
contributions will be distributed at the workshop.  Attendance at the
workshop will be limited to around 40 persons. People interested in
attending without intention to give a talk have to submit a short
"position paper" stating the reasons for their interest in the
workshop. On the basis of these position papers, the organisers will
decide which of the non-speakers will be admitted. (Rejected submitted
abstracts are automatically treated as "position papers".)

All submissions (abstracts, full papers and position papers) should
include an exact address and an e-mail address.



 	Important Dates:

 	Deadline for submission:        March 19
 	Notification of acceptance:     May 1
 	Final version of abstract:      June 1

Since the time for reviewing is rather short the deadline for
submissions will be rather strict.

               Call for Papers

    ECAI 94 WORKSHOP on: ARTIFICIAL NORMATIVE REASONING

    Amsterdam, Monday, 8 August 1994
    (The workshop will be held as part of the 11th  European Conference
    on Artificial Intelligence, 8 - 12 August)

Key-words: (Para)Legal Reasoning, deontic logic/operators,
	   assessment problems, representation of regulations


Artificial Normative Reasoning (ANR) is a field of AI research that is  
concerned with reasoning in normative domains. These domains are governed by
implicit or explicit regulations. Typical examples are legal domains (``AI 
& Law''), but also paralegal and other normative domains such as
administrative ones (e.g. loans assessment, insurance 
claims, certification).
ANR research has roots in, and ramifications to
theoretical issues in AI, in particular with the epistemological and 
logical foundations of representing normative and common sense knowledge, 
case based reasoning and problem solving methods for assessment tasks. ANR 
is also an important field of application, in particular as part of the 
intelligent automisation of administrative institutes such as banks, civil 
services, government, etc. (Para-) Legal knowledge based systems  
cover a suffiently large market to warrant the (re)use of specialised 
knowledge acquisition methodologies and tools, and the development of 
articulate and dedicated system architectures. 

It is the objective of the Workshop to bring together both theoretical and 
applied perspectives, focussing on representation formalisms, modelling of 
normative knowledge, and reasoning methods. Papers are sollicited addressing 
these issues, and containing theoretical argument and demonstration, and/or 
empirical generalization. 

Participation

Because the informal exchange of ideas is emphasized participation of
the workshop is limited to a maximum of 30 participants. 

Papers

Papers should be sent for refereeing to the coordinator (Joost Breuker) 
either in hardcopy (4 copies), or in electronic form via email (ascii,
preferrably Latex), not exceeding 5000 words (see Schedule below).
Electronically submitted papers should expect confirmation of receipt
within 24 hours.
Papers will be refereed by at least three members of the Committee.
All accepted papers will be published as ECAI Workshop Notes and made
available to the participants. A subset of these papers will be
selected for publication in a book on Normative Reasoning.*


Statements

Authors of accepted papers are also requested to provide between two to 
five statements (``theses'') on current research in ANR, preferrably 
based upon, or as conclusions of their paper contribution. These theses 
will be grouped around topics which will be discussed at the Workshop.

Workshop

The Workshop itself will not consist of full paper presentations, but of 
short invited introductions on actual research topics. These topics will be 
based upon the Statements which participants of the Workshop should send in 
at least six weeks before the Workshop. 

All participants of the Workshop will be able to obtain an electronic 
version of the Proceedings and Statements at least four weeks before the 
ECAI via ftp, restricted to participants of the Workshop, or via email.

               AGENT THEORIES, ARCHITECTURES, AND LANGUAGES

                  Call for Papers - An ECAI '94 Workshop
                       Amsterdam, August 8th, 1994




Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is concerned with  building,  modeling  and  under-
standing  systems  that  exhibit some aspect of intelligent behaviour.  Yet
it is  only comparatively recently  --  since about the mid 1980s  --  that
issues  surrounding  the  synthesis  of  intelligent autonomous agents have
entered the mainstream of AI. Despite the undoubted interest on the part of
the  international  research  community,  there  is currently no recognised
forum for presenting work in this area. Results are published in a  diverse
range  of  journals,  workshops,  and  conferences, making it difficult for
researchers to meet and follow developments.  The  aim  of  this  workshop,
therefore, is to provide an arena in which researchers working in all areas
related to the theoretical and  practical  aspects  of  both  hardware  and
software  agent synthesis can further extend their understanding and exper-
tise by meeting and exchanging ideas, techniques and results with research-
ers working in related areas.


Workshop Themes


o    Theories of intelligent agents.

     How do the various components of an agent's cognitive makeup  conspire
     to  produce rational behaviour? What is the relationship between these
     components? What formalisms are appropriate for expressing aspects  of
     agent  theory?  Do  we need logic-based formalisms? If not, is another
     type of mathematical framework appropriate?


o    Architectures for intelligent agents.

     What structure should an artificial intelligent agent have?  Is  reac-
     tive  behaviour enough? Or do we need deliberation as well? How can we
     integrate reactive and deliberative components cleanly?  What  is  the
     relationship  between  an agent theory and architecture? How are we to
     reason about reactive systems?


o    Languages for intelligent agents.

     What are the right primitives for programming  an  intelligent  agent?
     How  are  these  primitives  related to the theory of an agent, or its
     architecture?  Can we realistically hope to execute  agent  specifica-
     tions  in  complex,  perhaps  multi-modal languages? Should we aim for
     simple agents, with limited internal complexity,  or  for agents  with
     complex reasoning abilities?


We are particularly interested in papers that cross theme  boundaries,  for
example,  by  relating  theories  to  architectures,  or  architectures  to
languages.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

         Workshop on ALGORITHMS, COMPLEXITY AND COMMONSENSE REASONING
                   Held in conjunction with ECAI-94
	   (European Conference on Artificial Intelligence)
                      Amsterdam August 9, 1994

The idea of formalizing commonsense reasoning has always been central to the
field of Artificial Intelligence in general and Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning in particular. Many different logical formalisms have been proposed
and their semantic properties carefully analyzed. Only more recently
particular attention has been devoted to the computational complexity analysis
and the  development of efficient algorithms to implement these formalisms.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and provide a forum
for discussion of current research, recent results, and open problems of both
a theoretical and practical nature. 

We encourage the submission of papers describing the design of efficient
algorithms and complexity results in the following (non-exhaustive) list
of topic areas:

- abduction               - belief revision
- diagnosis               - epistemic logics
- nonmonotonic logics     - planning 
- taxonomic logics        - temporal reasoning. 

Theoretical studies as well as empirical results are welcome. Attendance will
be limited and by invitation only. Authors of accepted papers will be invited.
Others wishing to attend should submit a statement of interest consisting in a
short description of their past accomplishments and current research
interests. 

Although original papers are preferred, recent results already appeared in the
literature are also welcome. The program committee will review EXTENDED
ABSTRACTS rather than full papers. The papers should be at most 15 pages
including title page and bibliography. Statements of interest should be of
approximately 2 pages in length. Electronic submissions (Standard LaTeX,
Postscript or ASCII files) are encouraged where possible and must be received
by April 15, 1994. No formal proceedings or collection of papers from the
workshop will be published. Papers and statements of interest should be sent
to the chairperson:

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

ECAI-94 WORKSHOP ON 
APPLIED GENETIC AND OTHER EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS
Amsterdam, August 9, 1994

One of the reasons for the growing interest in genetic and other 
evolutionary algorithms is their good performance on a wide scale 
of problems. However, practical applications may raise issues 
beyond the scope of classical models. The goal of this workshop is 
to cumulate knowledge on the application of EAs and in particular 
to study changes to and extensions of the standard approaches. 
Topics of interest include but are not restricted to:

o problem elicitation and representation,
o non-standard genotypes and recombination operators,
o genetic programming,
o handling constraints,
o boosting performance,
o combination with other techniques, e.g. local search, neural nets,
  knowledge based systems,
o advantages and disadvantages of EAs w.r.t. other techniques.

About 10-12 of the participants will have the opportunity to 
introduce his/her work in the form of a short presentation. Other 
persons interested in the subject may also participate in a limited
number. Besides the presentations, substantial time will be allocated
for discussion and comparison of the presented results. Our hope is 
that insights gained at the workshop may facilitate further 
applications and support new theory. 

SUBMISSIONS
Two kinds of contributions are invited 

o papers that describe successful practical applications,
o papers investigating relevant issues by extensive test sessions on 
  a test bench.

In both cases the problem(s) to be solved and the issue(s) to be 
investigated should be clearly described followed by the system 
description and  experiment setup. Evaluation of the system and 
analysis of the test results should be given to support the 
conclusions.

Three camera ready copies of a full paper not exceeding 12 pages 
(12 point font, single space) including figures and references 
should be sent to

    ECAI 94 WORKSHOP on: ARTIFICIAL NORMATIVE REASONING

    Amsterdam, Monday, 8 August 1994

Artificial Normative Reasoning (ANR) is a field of AI research that is
concerned with reasoning in normative domains. These domains are governed by
implicit or explicit regulations. Typical examples are legal domains (``AI
& Law''), but also paralegal and other normative domains such as
administrative ones (e.g. loans assessment, insurance
claims, certification).
ANR research has roots in, and ramifications to
theoretical issues in AI, in particular with the epistemological and
logical foundations of representing normative and common sense knowledge,
case based reasoning and problem solving methods for assessment tasks. ANR
is also an important field of application, in particular as part of the
intelligent automisation of administrative institutes such as banks, civil
services, government, etc. (Para-) Legal knowledge based systems
cover a suffiently large market to warrant the (re)use of specialised
knowledge acquisition methodologies and tools, and the development of
articulate and dedicated system architectures.

It is the objective of the Workshop to bring together both theoretical and
applied perspectives, focussing on representation formalisms, modelling of
normative knowledge, and reasoning methods. Papers are sollicited addressing
these issues, and containing theoretical argument and demonstration, and/or
empirical generalization.

Participation

Because the informal exchange of ideas is emphasized participation of
the workshop is limited to a maximum of 30 participants.

Papers

Papers should be sent for refereeing to the coordinator (Joost Breuker)
either in hardcopy (4 copies), or in electronic form via email (ascii,
preferrably Latex), not exceeding 5000 words (see Schedule below).
Electronically submitted papers should expect confirmation of receipt
within 24 hours.
Papers will be refereed by at least three members of the Committee.
All accepted papers will be published as ECAI Workshop Notes and made
available to the participants. A subset of these papers will be
selected for publication in a book on Normative Reasoning.*


Statements

Authors of accepted papers are also requested to provide between two to
five statements (``theses'') on current research in ANR, preferrably
based upon, or as conclusions of their paper contribution. These theses
will be grouped around topics which will be discussed at the Workshop.

Workshop

The Workshop itself will not consist of full paper presentations, but of
short invited introductions on actual research topics. These topics will be
based upon the Statements which participants of the Workshop should send in
at least six weeks before the Workshop.

All participants of the Workshop will be able to obtain an electronic
version of the Proceedings and Statements at least four weeks before the
ECAI via ftp, restricted to participants of the Workshop, or via email.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

         Workshop on ALGORITHMS, COMPLEXITY AND COMMONSENSE REASONING
                   Held in conjunction with ECAI-94
                      Amsterdam August 9, 1994

The idea of formalizing commonsense reasoning has always been central to the
field of Artificial Intelligence in general and Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning in particular. Many different logical formalisms have been proposed
and their semantic properties carefully analyzed. Only more recently
particular attention has been devoted to the computational complexity analysis
and the  development of efficient algorithms to implement these formalisms.
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and provide a forum
for discussion of current research, recent results, and open problems of both
a theoretical and practical nature.

We encourage the submission of papers describing the design of efficient
algorithms and complexity results in the following (non-exhaustive) list
of topic areas:

- abduction               - belief revision
- diagnosis               - epistemic logics
- nonmonotonic logics     - planning
- taxonomic logics        - temporal reasoning.

Theoretical studies as well as empirical results are welcome. Attendance will
be limited and by invitation only. Authors of accepted papers will be invited.
Others wishing to attend should submit a statement of interest consisting in a
short description of their past accomplishments and current research
interests.

Although original papers are preferred, recent results already appeared in the
literature are also welcome. The program committee will review EXTENDED
ABSTRACTS rather than full papers. The papers should be at most 15 pages
including title page and bibliography. Statements of interest should be of
approximately 2 pages in length. Electronic submissions (Standard LaTeX,
Postscript or ASCII files) are encouraged where possible and must be received
by April 15, 1994. No formal proceedings or collection of papers from the
workshop will be published. Papers and statements of interest should be sent
to the chairperson:

                      CALL FOR WORKSHOP PARTICIPATION

                              PARTS AND WHOLES:
            CONCEPTUAL PART-WHOLE RELATIONS AND FORMAL MEREOLOGY

                           Monday, August 8, 1994
                         Amsterdam, The Netherlands

                           Held in conjunction with
                                  ECAI-94
           (11th European Conference  on  Artificial  Intelligence)


   Currently, there are two main approaches to the study of "parts" and
their relations. The conceptual (cognitive) approach looks at the variety
of part-whole relations and their role in language processing, perception,
and action planning; the philosophical/logical approach, on the other hand,
looks at formal theories of parts, wholes and related concepts in the
framework of formal ontology.

   There are important differences between the two views. Philosophical
systems tend to focus on a single "part-*of*" relation used for modeling
ontological domains like time, space, or pluralities; conceptual approaches
tend to assume a whole family of different "part-*whole*" relations for a
variety of entities and tasks. Classical logical theories such as
Lesniewski's
or Goodman's privileged extensional aspects of the part-wholerelation,
while
for conceptual approaches and intensional formal mereology the old proverb
holds that a whole is more than its parts.

   While disciplines such as linguistics, philosophy and psychology have
contributed significantly to the research in this field, their impact on
artificial intelligence is extremely limited, although AI could represent
the ideal workbench for a unification of approaches dominant in different
fields. Knowledge about parts is of great importance for a wide variety of
AI
domains, like vision, qualitative and naive physics, robotics, and natural
language processing. For example, the structure of an object can be used
for visual recognition, for reasoning about the functionality of the whole,
or for planning its assembly.

   The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from these
various disciplines in order to explore

   (i)   the benefits and limits of formal mereology in modeling
commonsense
         part-whole relations;
   (ii)  the import for knowledge representation formalisms of the two
         current approaches to the study of "parts" and their relations;
   (iii) the possibility of a unified theory of parts and wholes.

   The workshop topics will include the following:

- Classical extensional mereology: uses, extensions and adaptations;
  comparison with alternatives to mereology: set theory and lattices.
- Intensional mereology: essence, dependence, and integrity; individual
  properties as parts.
- Conceptual distinctions among wholes: masses, collections, complexes;
  natural entities and artifacts; sums and scattered individuals.
- Parts and structure: physical connection, spatial, temporal, functional
  and other constraints among parts; Gestalt theories and perceptual parts;
  granularity issues.
- Parts, space and time: relationships between mereology, topology,
  geometry; boundaries and surfaces; relationships between parts of
physical
  objects (continuants) and parts of events (occurrents).
- Parts and natural language: parts, part-names and possessive
constructions;
  plurals and mass terms.
- Reasoning about parts: transitivity, upper and downward inheritance of
  properties.
- Dealing with parts within existing KR formalisms: distinguishing parts
  from other attributes, computational issues of reasoning about parts.

Two possible kinds of contributions are solicited from interested
participants:

   (a) regular papers of 10 pages max, presenting on-going research;
   (b) position papers of 3 pages max, motivating the interest in the field
       and explaining particular points of view.

A limited number of regular papers will be chosen for an oral presentation
at the workshop, while suitable space will be devoted to discussions based
on contributions from participants (rejected regular papers are
automatically treated as position papers). Participation will be limited to
around 35 people.

Preference will be given in the workshop schedule to contributions
underlining the impact of mereological issues on AI practice, especially
on: knowledge representation, natural language processing, qualitative and
naive physics, spatial and temporal reasoning, vision, and robotics.

Submission of papers, regular and position, to any member of the workshop
organizing committee is due by April 15 1994. Hard copy (4 copies) and
electronic submissions (either PostScript, LaTex or MacWord converted in
BinHex
format) are equally acceptable, with a strong preference for the latter.
All submissions should include an exact address and an e-mail address.

                   SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
                      WORKSHOP ON CONSTRAINT PROCESSING

		               August 8th, 1994
  
            A one-day workshop to be held in conjunction with the
	  
	11th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'94)
               Amsterdam, The Netherlands, August 8-12th, 1994
   
   An increasing  number of researchers all over the world  are now dealing 
   with different  aspects of constraint processing  regarded as a  general 
   paradigm  of computation.  However, the constraint processing  community 
   appears to be  very heterogeneous:   Researchers from logic programming, 
   knowledge representation,  expert systems, theoretical computer science,  
   operations research  and other  related fields are investigating the use 
   of constraint processing methods, their theoretical foundations, as well 
   as their  applications  to real-life  problems.  Up to now there has not 
   been much effort to bring together researchers working  on or interested 
   in constraint processing  from different viewpoints and  to work out the 
   common principles,  vocabulary,  and techniques that are used as well as 
   similarities and differences between various viewpoints.
   
   This workshop aims at bringing together researchers working on different 
   aspects  of  constraint  processing  in order  to exchange,  compare and 
   contrast  basic  viewpoints,  different  approaches and  recent research 
   results.  Thus, the workshop is planned  as an interdisciplinary meeting 
   of  researchers as well as practitioners with an  active interest in the 
   area of constraint processing. It will provide an international forum to 
   discuss and exchange  new ideas and approaches,  and to present not only  
   full-blown research papers but also partial results, position papers and 
   reports on ongoing research. By that, it is hoped that a fruitful cross-
   fertilization among the various disciplines will result.
      
   Work on  all different aspects of  constraint processing  is of specific 
   interest for the workshop, including
   
     *  constraint-satisfaction methods and consistency techniques,
     *  constraint logic programming,
     *  concurrent constraint languages,
     *  constraints and knowledge representation,
     *  object-oriented constraint processing,
     *  constraint programming,
     *  constraint maintenance,
     *  constraints identification, specification, management and
        implementation techniques,
     *  over-specified constraint problems and constraint relaxation,
     *  creation and execution of constraint-satisfaction plans,
     *  constraint refinement,
     *  hierarchical constraint problems,
     *  parallel and distributed computing with constraints,
     *  finite (discrete) as well as continuous domain handling,
     *  real-time constraints,
     *  relations to operations research or deductive databases, 
     *  constraint processing in computer graphics, 
     *  theoretical foundations, 
     *  complexity results, and
     *  reports showing the practical relevance of constraint processing
	and what basic techniques are needed in practice.
   
   WORKSHOP FORMAT 
   
   The workshop is  planned as a combination  of presentations of submitted 
   papers,  an invited lecture by a  leading researcher in  constraint pro-
   cessing, and a round-table discussion  that shall stimulate the exchange 
   of new ideas and approaches among the participants.

               AGENT THEORIES, ARCHITECTURES, AND LANGUAGES

                2nd Call for Papers - An ECAI '94 Workshop
                       Amsterdam, August 8th, 1994




Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is concerned with  building,  modeling  and  under-
standing  systems  that  exhibit some aspect of intelligent behaviour.  Yet
it is  only comparatively recently  --  since about the mid 1980s  --  that
issues  surrounding  the  synthesis  of  intelligent autonomous agents have
entered the mainstream of AI. Despite the undoubted interest on the part of
the  international  research  community,  there  is currently no recognised
forum for presenting work in this area. Results are published in a  diverse
range  of  journals,  workshops,  and  conferences, making it difficult for
researchers to meet and follow developments.  The  aim  of  this  workshop,
therefore, is to provide an arena in which researchers working in all areas
related to the theoretical and  practical  aspects  of  both  hardware  and
software  agent synthesis can further extend their understanding and exper-
tise by meeting and exchanging ideas, techniques and results with research-
ers working in related areas.


Workshop Themes


o    Theories of intelligent agents.

     How do the various components of an agent's cognitive makeup  conspire
     to  produce rational behaviour? What is the relationship between these
     components? What formalisms are appropriate for expressing aspects  of
     agent  theory?  Do  we need logic-based formalisms? If not, is another
     type of mathematical framework appropriate?


o    Architectures for intelligent agents.

     What structure should an artificial intelligent agent have?  Is  reac-
     tive  behaviour enough? Or do we need deliberation as well? How can we
     integrate reactive and deliberative components cleanly?  What  is  the
     relationship  between  an agent theory and architecture? How are we to
     reason about reactive systems?


o    Languages for intelligent agents.

     What are the right primitives for programming  an  intelligent  agent?
     How  are  these  primitives  related to the theory of an agent, or its
     architecture?  Can we realistically hope to execute  agent  specifica-
     tions  in  complex,  perhaps  multi-modal languages? Should we aim for
     simple agents, with limited internal complexity,  or  for agents  with
     complex reasoning abilities?


We are particularly interested in papers that cross theme  boundaries,  for
example,  by  relating  theories  to  architectures,  or  architectures  to
languages.


Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to the following:

Agent Theories                              Agent Architectures

intentions                                  deliberative architectures
time, desires, beliefs, and goals           reactive architectures
situated automata                           hybrid architectures
logical models of agents
executing logical agent specifications      Agent Languages
rationality & bounded rationality
                                            agent specification languages
                                            the agent-oriented paradigm
                                            non-logical agent languages
                                            agent-based computing

                           Final Call for Papers


	      COMBINING SYMBOLIC AND CONNECTIONIST PROCESSING
	
	         Workshop held in conjunction with ECAI-94
                August 9, 1994 - Amsterdam, The Netherlands
			


----------------------REMINDER : DEADLINE IS APRIL 1 ----------------------


Until a few years ago, the history of AI has been marked by two parallel, 
often antagonistic streams of development -- classical or symbolic AI and 
connectionist processing. A recent research trend, premised on the 
complementarity of these two paradigms, strives to build hybrid systems 
which combine the advantages of both to overcome the limitations of each. 
For instance, attempts have been made to accomplish complex tasks by blending 
neural networks with rule-based or case-based reasoning. This workshop will 
be the first Europe-wide effort to bring together researchers active in the 
area in view of laying the groundwork for a theory and methodology of 
symbolic/connectionist integration (SCI). 

The workshop will focus on the following topics:

   o   theoretical (cognitive and computational) foundations of SCI

   o   techniques and mechanisms for combining symbolic and neural 
       processing methods (e.g. ways of improving and going beyond
       state-of-the-art rule compilation and extraction techniques)

   o   outstanding problems encountered and issues involved in SCI 
       (e.g. Which symbolic or connectionist representation schemes 
       are best adapted to SCI? The vector space used in neural nets 
       and the symbolic space have fundamental mathematical differences;
       how will these differences impact SCI? Do we have the conceptual 
       tools needed to cope with this representation problem?)

   o   profiles of application domains in which SCI has been (or can be) 
       shown to perform better than traditional approaches

   o   description, analysis and comparison of implemented 
       symbolic/connectionist systems


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Prospective participants should submit an extended abstract to the contact
person below, either via email in postscript format or via regular mail, 
in which case 3 copies are required. Each submission should include a
separate information page containing the title of the paper, author 
names and affiliations, and the complete address (including telephone, 
fax and email) of the first author.  The paper itself should not exceed
12 pages. Submission deadline is April 1, 1994.

Each paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee.
Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to first authors by 
May 1, 1994. Camera-ready copies of accepted papers are due on June 1st and 
will be reproduced for distribution at the workshop.

Those who wish to participate without presenting a paper should send a
request describing their research interests and/or previous work in the
field of SCI. Since attendance will be limited to ensure effective 
interaction, these requests will be considered after screening of submitted
papers. All workshop participants are required to register for the main 
conference.

                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                        Logic and Change


                        Workshop at ECAI-94
                        August 8 -- 12, 1994,
                        Amsterdam, The Netherlands



The theme of the workshop is the confrontation of different approaches
to the declarative representation of change in intelligent systems.
Possible topics of contributions might be the following, however, the
list is not exhaustive:

  + Relevance and Change
  + Causality  and Change
  + Requirements for a formal approach to Action
  + Foundational approach to revision
  + Conditional logic and change
  + Syntactical versus semantical views of change
  + Abduction and Change
  + Nonmonotonicity and Change


We emphasize especially contributions concerning the relationship
between different approaches.  Since we want to benefit from the
informal character of a workshop, we are less interested in special
research papers of this field and we are more interested in papers
that focus on fundamental issues which may reach from a critical
assessment of current research trends to guidelines and perspectives
for future research.
We would also like to encourage contributions which shed a light on
the specific problems which arise when an approach is confronted with
applications.


Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-5 pages) or a
full paper in English by electronic mail (postscript file or
tex-dvifile) or alternatively 4 hard copies. The submitted papers will
be refereed by the workshop organisors.  Copies of the accepted
contributions will be distributed at the workshop.  Attendance at the
workshop will be limited to around 40 persons. People interested in
attending without intention to give a talk have to submit a short
"position paper" stating the reasons for their interest in the
workshop. On the basis of these position papers, the organisers will
decide which of the non-speakers will be admitted. (Rejected submitted
abstracts are automatically treated as "position papers".)

A related area of interest, Spatial and Temporal Reasoning, will also be
covered at ECAI in another workshop organized by
Frank D. Anger (fdang@dcs106.dcsnod.uwf.edu)
Hans W. Guesgen (hans@cs.aukuni.ac.nz)
Gerard Ligozat (ligozat@limsi.fr).

All submissions (abstracts, full papers and position papers) should
include an exact address and an e-mail address.



         Important Dates:

         Deadline for submission:        April 19
         Notification of acceptance:     May 20
         Final version of abstract:      June 10

Since the time for reviewing is rather short the deadline for
submissions will be rather strict.

In The Hague, the city where the Dutch Parliament is situated, we will
visit the 'Mauritshuis', a Royal Picture Gallery with one of the
finest collections of 17th century Dutch paintings. We will also visit
'Panorama Mesdag', a gigantic circular canvas, which gives a
fascinating view of the old fishing village of Scheveningen in 1880,
with its wide sea, its windswept skies and sandy dunes. The canvas was
created by the famous marine painter H.W. Mesdag, assisted by his wife
and some other painters. We will have lunch in Delft, a 17th century
town with its narrow canals and stately homes. During a walk through
the historic part of Delft, we will visit the Delft Blue factory 'De
Porceleyne Fles'.

By bus we will go to Hoorn, where we will sail on an historic
clipper. After lunch on board we will arrive in Marken, where at one
time the fashion of ages ago came to a standstill. The traditional
costume, unique in the world of folklore is still worn by the
inhabitants of Marken. We will walk through the village and see the
houses built on poles and painted in traditional green and

cart. Here the farmer unloads his cheese with the cheese bearers, who
wear traditional white costumes and straw hats. After our visit to
Edam we will travel to Volendam where we will visit the 'Alida
Hoeve'. Here we will get a demonstration of how Edam and Gouda
farmers' cheese is made according to an old recipe. After we have
tasted the typical Dutch cheeses we will go to Enkhuizen. There we
will visit the 'Zuiderzeemuseum', where we will have lunch. In the
Zuiderzeemuseum you can see how people used to live and work one

T1   Models of uncertainty and graduality in AI

Didier Dubois (National Center for Scientific Research, France) and
Philippe Smets (Institut de Recherches Interdisciplinaires et de
Developpements en Intelligence Artificielle, France)

Researchers in automated reasoning, in database management systems and
in knowledge-based systems have felt the need for techniques that cope
with imperfect information. This is especially true when issues such
as inconsistency handling, numerical/symbolic interface, and belief
revision are addressed. Classical logic and the Bayesian view of
probability are not always enough to deal with those issues even if
they suggest useful guidelines.

This tutorial will provide an introduction to non classical models of
uncertainty and vagueness that have been developed in the last 20
years, very often in connection with Artificial Intelligence. These
models include numerical approaches such as fuzzy sets and possibility
theory, belief functions, and more logical-oriented developments such
as nonmonotonic reasoning. The tutorial is made of four lectures
respectively devoted to a survey of various forms of imperfect
information, an introduction to fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic and
possibility theory, a comparative introduction to several belief
functions theories, and the connection between uncertainty models and
nonmonotonic inference. The tutorial will survey the various
approaches in a knowledge-based systems perspective, hoping that it
might lead potential users to a better understanding of why these
models differ, how they can be related and when to use what.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial will assume that the audience has
some knowledge of probability theory and propositional calculus.


T2 The knowledge medium
   (The use of formal knowledge representation for institutional
   memory and communication)

Thomas Gruber (Stanford University) and Luc Steels (Free University Brussels)

Computer technology has begun to redefine how human knowledge is
communicated and used in organisations. Networked multimedia systems,
which can store and display information in a variety of modalities,
are used to support the communication of virtual teams across space
and time barriers.  Knowledge systems, which do limited reasoning on
symbolic representations of knowledge, are used to deliver specialised
or complex knowledge in an operational form where it is needed. The
knowledge medium is the convergence of these two trends, in which
machine-interpretable representations are part of the medium by which
we communicate and transmit our knowledge.

This tutorial will explore the role of knowledge representation in a
medium for communication and institutional memory. Applications will
be described in which knowledge is communicated and shared in forms
understood by both humans and software agents. Examples include
interactive, model-generated documentation of designed artifacts;
content-based routing of information among collaborating agents; and
the synthesis of knowledge-based software from libraries of reusable
components. Fundamental research issues to be discussed include the
design and use of shared representations, and knowledge level
specifications of tasks, agent capabilities, and information needs.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is intended for researchers and
practitioners interested in new applications of AI to problems of
enterprise integration, computer-supported communication, software
reuse, and software interoperability.  Only a basic familiarity with
knowledge representation and software engineering will be assumed.


T3   Intelligent multimedia interfaces

Mark Maybury (MITRE Corporation, Badford, MA, USA) and Yigal Arens
(University of Southern California)

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the emerging literature
and set of techniques for building multimedia and multimodal
interfaces, i.e., those interfaces that interpret and generate
multiple media, e.g., spoken and written natural language, graphics,
non-speech audio, maps, animation). This tutorial will last a half day
and will be primarily a lecture, with time allotted to clarify issues
and respond to questions from the audience.

This tutorial will begin by motivating the value of a system that is
able to communicate using multiple media and modalities using examples
found in human-human communication. We define terms and note
terminological problems found in the literature, then describe an
architecture for integrated multimedia parsing and generation, which
will serve as a reference model for the remainder of the tutorial. We
next distinguish the specific kinds of knowledge utilised by these
systems and then describe the theory, illustrated with implemented
application examples, of multimedia parsing and generation. Finally,
we discuss systems that have integrated both parsing and
generation. The tutorial concludes by outlining key areas for further
research and expected future directions in the field. Throughout the
tutorial, specific descriptions of prototype systems (e.g., from the
MIT Media Lab, USC/ISI, Columbia University, the German Center for
Research in AI, IRST) will be used to illustrate the components of a
more general model of multimodal and multimedia communication.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is relevant to those researchers
and practitioners interested in investigating, designing, and
implementing intelligent interfaces that exploit multiple media and
modalities to facilitate human- computer interaction. There is no
prerequisite knowledge required, although general knowledge of user
interfaces and artificial intelligence will enhance the value of this
course for participants.


T4   Reasoning with cases: theory and practice

Klaus-Dieter Althoff (University of Kaiserslautern), Michel Manago
(AcknoSoft, France), Stefan Wess (University of Kaiserslautern)

The objective of the tutorial is to present two technologies for
reasoning with cases: induction and case-based reasoning. Induction is
a form of machine learning that is used to automatically extract
general knowledge (for instance in the form of a decision tree or a
set of rules) from a database of cases. Case-based reasoning is a
problem solving method that makes direct use of past experiences
(cases) rather than a corpus of general knowledge such as rules.

In this tutorial, we will show how reasoning with cases helps solve a
new category of applications and how it also offers an alternative to
classical rule-based reasoning. We will introduce, compare and
contrast the two technologies, expose the history and areas of current
research, present the architecture of a case-based reasoning system
and describe some basic algorithms. We will show how cases can be
indexed for efficient retrieval, how the similarity between new and
past cases is assessed, how cases are represented (feature-value
vectors, object representations), how to use additional background
domain knowledge, and we will compare the technologies with other
forms of automated reasoning.

Induction and case-based reasoning are now mature technologies that
have reached the market. Strategic custom applications in various
domains have been delivered (and are being used) and "off the shelf"
products are available. We will review tools developed by commercial
and non-commercial organisations, identify the market for these and
show some real applications in technical maintenance and diagnosis.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial aims at presenting a survey of
the technologies and delineating their areas of application. The
intended audience is composed of the managing and technical staff of
computer divisions interested in technologies for reasoning with
cases. Knowledge engineers interested in up-to-date methodologies for
developing applications and users with a specific potential
application in mind will also appreciate the tutorial. There are no
prerequisites.


T5   The art and the science of modelling:
     (crucial issues in building second generation knowledge-based systems)

Peter Struss (Technical University of Munich) and Bert Bredeweg
(University of Amsterdam)

Reasoning about the physical world has always been a key problem in
AI. It is in the core of common sense reasoning, and it is central to
many automated problems solvers that are intended to deal with
industrial applications. Recently, model-based systems have become a
focal point of both theoretical work and efforts to build powerful
systems, and the field is now mature for significant applications.
Designing an adequate model for the domain and task at hand is the key
problem and step. The quality of the model crucially effects the
competence and robustness of the problem solving system, the
generality and reusability of the knowledge base (and, hence,
development costs) the interaction with the system and its performance
(e.g.  real-time behaviour). The research efforts of the last fifteen
years or so result in a vast set of powerful theories, useful
techniques, and sophisticated systems which is hard to overlook for
the practioner and the newcomer to the field, and, still, much of
successful modeling appears to be more like an art rather than an
engineering task. The tutorial provides a critical overview of the
field. It discusses requirements and objectives in modeling for
knowledge-based systems, the existing formal theories and tools as
well as their limitations and open problems. We will organise it along
a number of key problems, questions, and requirements raised by real
domains and applications, and analyze how different theories and
techniques address these issues. Examples deal with design and
configuration, failure mode analysis, simulation, analysis, testing,
sensor placement, diagnosis and repair, supervision, explanation and
tutoring and treat physical systems, biological and ecological
systems, and enterprises.

Prerequisite knowledge: The tutorial is intended for developers of
industrial applications as well as novices in the field and
researchers from other AI areas. The former should receive help for
finding solutions to their problems, while the latter may find what is
worth while working on. No extensive knowledge in AI is required for
attending. Some basic knowledge in mathematics, logic, knowledge
representation, and reasoning is helpful, but not mandatory.


T6   Validation of knowledge-based systems

Pedro Meseguer (Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona) and Alun
Preece (University of Savoie, France)

This tutorial will provide participants with a firm understanding of
the current state-of-the-art in techniques and tools for validating
knowledge-based systems (KBS). Highlights of the presentation will
include a detailed examination of methods for performing rigorous
verification, testing and evaluation of these systems. Our intention
is to give attendees a solid introduction to the theoretical
foundation of KBS validation methods, together with a clear
understanding of how the methods can be applied in practice. Our
analysis of KBS verification tools and techniques will cover not only
classical rule-based systems, but also systems with uncertainty,
explicit control knowledge, frames, and procedural components. We will
describe the underlying algorithms, and will draw upon practical
experience to consider issues arising in the use of verification
tools---for example, how to interpret their output. A thorough survey
of testing techniques for KBS will include both an assessment of the
applicability of testing approaches from software engineering, and an
examination of special problems in testing KBS. We will also consider
broader issues in KBS evaluation, concerned with ensuring that a
delivered system will be used productively. All of these techniques
will be illustrated using case studies from KBS practice. Finally, we
place the validation activities in context by relating them to other
activities in the KBS life-cycle, and also by relating them to other
important topics in artificial intelligence. Participants will leave
this tutorial with a set of recommendations for carrying out rigorous
and effective validation to ensure the quality of their KBS.

Prerequisite Knowledge: Participants in this tutorial should be
familiar with knowledge-based systems, at least to the level of an
introductory textbook. The tutorial is aimed at participants with an
interest in quality assurance of KBS, especially systems builders or
managers currently involved--or anticipating involvement--in
developing KBS.


T7 Managing machine-learning application development and
   organisational implementation

Yves Kodratoff (University of Paris-Sud) and Vassilis Moustakis
(Technical University of Crete, Greece)

Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to Industry is made at once
difficult by the large amount of available techniques and programs
that are able to perform induction or support learning of some
kind. It also represents a challenge both in terms of the application
and of ML itself in that a great proportion of the user community is
torn between the hopes and promises brought about by innovations in ML
science and technology on the one hand and their need to understand,
and, ultimately use these innovations to support knowledge based
system (KBS) tasks on the other.  The tutorial will cover all phases
underlying (ML) application development. Special emphasis will be
placed upon lessons learned from existing industrial `real world' ML
applications. From a technical point of view the tutorial will address
the issue of coupling application specifics with ML systems. It will
suggest a systematic framework, sufficient for supporting ML
application management and ML system selection according to
application requirements. It will also emphasise the numerous problems
met when Knowledge Acquisition has to be coupled with ML: most
existing industrialised ML applications had to perform the acquisition
of the knowledge necessary to have the ML system running.

The tutorial will adopt an application bias in reviewing the
conditions under which a given ML technique should be applied. Results
are demonstrated by way of a series of real world ML application case
studies.  The tutorial should be useful to both ML researchers and ML
practitioners. ML practitioners will get an overview of ML system
capabilities and potential in addition to having a chance to learn
about real world applications. ML researchers may find this tutorial
useful in understanding reality of applications and identify gaps
pointing to the need for further system development or enhancement.

Prerequisite Knowledge: Participants who want to attend this tutorial
should possess a minimum of AI skills. Acquaintance with machine
learning is desirable although not necessary.


T8 Knowledge-based production management

Norman M. Sadeh and Stephen F. Smith (Carnegie Mellon's Robotics
Institute, Pittsburgh)

This tutorial will introduce participants to the concepts, techniques,
and methodologies that have emerged from work in knowledge-based
production management. We will first consider the shortcomings of
traditional approaches to production management (e.g., MRP/MRP II) and
identify opportunities provided by knowledge-based technologies both
in overcoming these limitations, and in contributing to effective
implementation of modern manufacturing philosophies (e.g. Just in
Time).  We will then review in more detail the essential concepts and
techniques underlying dominant approaches to knowledge-based
production management. We will cover object-centered modeling
frameworks, simulation and rule-based techniques, temporal constraint
management, blackboard and multi-perspective techniques, constrained
heuristic search, uncertainty management, iterative improvement
techniques, distributed production management, and intelligent
interactive scheduling frameworks. In each case, we will characterise
strengths and weaknesses from the standpoint of different production
management requirements, and indicate the results that work under each
approach has produced to date.  Finally, we will examine a few
successful applications, and assess the current state of theory and
practice.

Over the past decade, a large (and continually increasing) number of
efforts (both research and development) have sought to investigate and
exploit the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts and
techniques in production management applications. In some cases,
AI-based concepts have provided frameworks for making traditional
Operations Research (OR) techniques more accessible and usable in
practical production management settings. In other cases, novel
concepts and techniques have been developed that offer new
opportunities for more cost-effective factory
performance. Knowledge-based scheduling and planning techniques are
having an increasing operational impact in complex production
management applications.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is aimed at both practitioners
and researchers who are interested in applying knowledge-based
techniques to practical production management problems. It will also
be useful to technology managers who want to keep abreast of the
current state of the art in knowledge-based production management. The
tutorial assumes knowledge of AI at the level of an introductory
course as well as some familiarity with basic production management
concepts.


T9   Multi-agent systems and distributed AI

Les Gasser (University of Southern California) and Jeffrey
S. Rosenschein (Hebrew University Jerusalem)

Multi-Agent Systems and Distributed AI (MAS/DAI) are concerned with
how to coordinate behaviour among a collection of semi-autonomous
problem-solving agents, so that they can act together to solve joint
problems, or make individually or globally reasonable decisions
despite uncertainty and conflict.  MAS/DAI systems are a research
reality, and are rapidly becoming practical partners in critical tasks
such as telecommunications control and management, power distribution,
product development, manufacturing, robotics, enterprise
integration/coordination, and organization design.

This tutorial will provide a thorough survey of problems, theory,
techniques and applications in contemporary Multi-Agent Systems and
Distributed AI. We will develop a comprehensive picture of current
knowledge and contemporary currents in MAS/DAI, in preparation for
building MAS/DAI systems or as background for doing advanced research
on outstanding MAS/DAI problems. The tutorial is designed for people
who are professionally interested in building MAS/DAI systems, for AI
researchers interested in learning about a range of MAS/DAI
approaches, and for technology planners and managers who need to know
about leading-edge technologies.

Prerequisite Knowledge:
The tutorial presumes knowledge of AI at the level of an introductory
AI course.


T10   Temporal reasoning in AI

Han Reichgelt (University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica) and
Lluis Vila (Institute for Research in AI of Blanes, Spain)

The notion of time is ubiquitous in any activity that requires
intelligence. A whole range of intelligent tasks require reasoning
about time like Diagnosis, Explanation, Planning, Process supervision,
Natural language understanding. It follows that the representation of
time and reasoning about time is of crucial importance for Artificial
Intelligence systems. This tutorial is intended to demonstrate it, to
give a clear picture of the different issues involved in a temporal
reasoning system, and to provide a progressively detailed analysis of
each of these different issues discussing the advantages and
shortcomings of the different approaches in the literature. The
tutorial will be comprised of the following sessions:
  Introduction,
  What is temporal reasoning?,
  Why it is so important?,
  How it can be used in practice?,
  Ontologies of time,
  How should time be conceptualised, e.g. as points or as intervals?,
  What are the advantages of each conceptualisation?,
  Temporal logics,
  Method of temporal arguments,
  Modal temporal logic,
  Reified temporal logic,
  Critical comparison of the three 
  Algorithms for temporal reasoning,
  Change, causality and non-monotonicity.    

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial will assume some basic
understanding of first-order predicate calculus. However, it will
assume no in-depth knowledge of the field of temporal reasoning. It is
our intention to present both introductory and in-depth material. The
tutorial will therefore be suitable both to complete novices in the
field and those with some background in the area.


T11   Rules in databases and knowledge bases

Ulrike Griefahn and Rainer Manthey (University of Bonn)

Rules have been a well-known concept in artificial intelligence since
long, investigated in connection with expert systems, knowledge bases,
or logic programming. Various instances of the rule concept were later
adopted by the database community in view of extending AI techniques
towards the handling of large amounts of data. Today there are two
major directions of activity in database research which are concerned
with the introduction of rules into database systems: active and
deductive databases.  Meanwhile, a significant amount of
database-specific techniques have been developed. These approaches are
relevant for research in AI, too, as many of today's expert system
applications are related to large quantities of data. But even in case
of comparatively small amounts of data, not necessarily requiring
database technology, some of the techniques developed in the DB
community seem to be interesting alternatives to "classical" AI
solutions.  The tutorial aims at providing a compact, up-to-date
overview of the state-of-the-art in active and deductive databases. In
addition, first results towards an integration of both kinds of rules
within a common framework are presented, focusing on the
implementation of deductive inference by means of active rules.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The presenters try to keep the tutorial
largely self-contained. However, basic knowledge about databases
(primarily relational databases), logic programming, and expert
systems are helpful.


T12   Principles and practice of knowledge acquisition

Angel R. Puerta (Stanford University) and Henrik Eriksson (Linkoeping
University)

Knowledge acquisition draws from many research areas. Due to the
complexity of the fields involved, it is often more productive to
examine knowledge acquisition from an empirical point of view, than to
do so from a purely theoretical one. This tutorial will develop a
comprehensive view of the most important principles and practical
issues in knowledge acquisition. We will present the theoretical
foundations of knowledge acquisition to establish a framework in which
the attendee can understand and analyze how the theories are put to
practice. We will concentrate on illustrating problems in using
computer-based knowledge- acquisition tools, covering examples from
early expert systems to the new generation of knowledge- based systems
based on reusable knowledge components. Throughout the tutorial, we
will emphasise the particular issues that affect the design and
development of knowledge-acquisition tools. The attendee will learn
what principles and design tradeoffs are involved in the construction
of knowledge-acquisition tools, and what are the research issues in
knowledge acquisition.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is suited for anyone who has an
introductory background in artificial intelligence. The course will be
especially helpful to knowledge engineers involved in the development
of knowledge-based systems, to research scientists who work with
knowledge bases, and to anyone desiring an overview of the advances in
knowledge acquisition.


T13a and T13b   Artificial life and autonomous robots 

Luc Steels and assistants (Free University Brussels) and
David McFarland (University of Oxford)

This tutorial is a unique opportunity for AI researchers to get an
overview of the newly developing paradigm of behaviour-oriented AI and
to understand the approach in sufficient technical detail. This
tutorial consists of two parts: the first part is given in the morning
and is particularly important for the necessary background and
motivation (Steels and McFarland). The second part is given in the
afternoon and will give hands-on experience, and potentially will give
researchers the chance to continue working in this area (Steels and
assistants). Artificial Life studies the phenomenon of life the same
way AI studies intelligence: by building artificial systems that show
the same capabilities as living systems. This tutorial gives an
overview of research in Alife, the behaviour-oriented approach to AI,
and the biological significance of this research. The first tutorial
is theoretical. An overview of the literature will be given and
important general trends discussed. The second tutorial focuses on
technical issues. An autonomous robot lab will be set up in which
participants have the opportunity to build their own robots out of
components made available in the lab. The secon tutorial will be
restricted to a smaller audience.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial is intended for researchers or
developers in any area of AI that want to learn about the new exciting
developments in behaviour-oriented AI research and its interaction
with Artificial Life. There are no prerequisites beyond general
knowledge about AI. The second tutorial requires general programming
experience but no prior experience in robot building.

W1   Formal specification methods for knowledge-based systems

Formal specification languages have become an important research topic
in the development of knowledge-based systems. This workshop focuses
on the formal semantics of the specification languages. It aims at a
better understanding of the various types of semantics for these
languages, within the context of their use as a tool for development
of knowledge based systems. Specific technical areas include: -
denotational and operational semantics - semantics of static knowledge
and procedural behaviour - tools for development of formal
specifications - Validation and verification of a formal specification
- verification of a system with respect to a formal specification A
specific aim of this workshop is to compare the work done by the
knowledge engineering community with results achieved by other
communities. We explicitly ask people from knowledge representation,
software engineering, information systems and deductive data bases to
join this workshop.

W2   Parts and wholes: conceptual part-whole relations and formal mereology
 
Currently, there are two main approaches to the study of "parts" and
their relations. The conceptual (cognitive) approach looks at the
variety of part-whole relations and their role in language processing,
perception, and action planning; the philosophical/logical approach
looks at theories of parts, wholes and related concepts in the
framework of formal mereology. The goal of this workshop is to bring
together researchers form different disciplines (AI, linguistics,
philosophy and psychology) in order to explore: - the import for
knowledge representation formalisms of the two current approaches to
the study of "parts" and their relations - the possibility of a
unified theory of parts and wholes for modelling commonsense
part-whole relations.

W3   Integration of machine learning and knowledge acquisition
 
Contrary to the naive thinking that the integration of ML and KA
should be obvious "since ML provides KA reusability" and "KA provides
ML knowledge of the domain", it seems that their integration actually
demands for progress in both fields, as many papers of a previous
IJCAI workshop have shown. We want to study in more details under
which conditions these two can be integrated in a common system. A
non-exhaustive list can be:
 - ML input
 - Specification of the required input of ML systems.
 - Characterisation of the output of ML systems in user's goal terms
   (What is the ML task).  
 - Elicitation of "hidden" control knowledge of ML systems (for
   example, what is a "good" example set).
 - KA input
 - Modelling ML systems at the knowledge level.
 - How can ML systems help to implement general knowledge acquisition
   methodologies.
 - Reusability of KA tools in ML framework. 
 
A strict selection criterion for acceptation to the workshop will be
that the interactions between the two techniques are really
studied. Authors are strongly encouraged to report on their practical
experience on development of industrial applications.

W4   Integrating object-orientation and knowledge representation
 
Object-oriented, conceptual, and frame-based modelling of domains have
much in common: all rely heavily on object-centered domain
representations employing the benefits of class hierarchies and
inheritance.  However, whereas object-orientation puts much emphasis
on practical programming issues and behavioral aspects of the model,
knowledge representation focuses on well-defined semantics in order to
achieve consistent, descriptive models. Frame-based techniques somehow
cover the middle ground. Meanwhile, each of these are individually
well understood. However, developers and researchers who are trying to
use object-oriented programming techniques in the realization of
knowledge-based AI systems are more and more interested in means for
integrating the techniques. Moreover, clarification of differences
with respect to integration is still far from complete. This workshop
is intended to close the gap. It is thus going to focus strongly on
aspects of integration of object-orientation and knowledge
representation.

W5   Logic and change

The theme of the workshop is the confrontation of different approaches
to the declarative representation of change in intelligent
systems. Possible topics of contributions might be the following,
however, the list is not exhaustive:
o   Relevance and Change
o   Causality and Change
o   Requirements for a formal approach to Action
o   Foundational approach to revision
o   Conditional logic and change
o   Syntactical versus semantical views of change
o   Abduction and Change
o   Nonmonotonicity and Change
We emphasize especially contributions concerning the relationship
between different approaches. Since we want to benefit from the
informal character of a workshop, we are less interested in special
research papers of this field and we are more interested in papers
that focus on fundamental issues which may reach from a critical
assessment of current research trends to guidelines and perspectives
for future research. We would also like to encourage contributions
which shed a light on the specific problems which arise when an
approach is confronted with applications.

W6   Constraint processing

Constraint processing regarded as a general paradigm of computation is
an emerging field in both research and applications. This workshop
aims at bringing together researchers as well as practitioners with an
active interest in the field of constraint processing in order to
exchange, compare and contrast basic viewpoints, different approaches
and recent research. This should result in identifying the basic
principles and contributing to a fruitful cross-fertilization between
the seemingly desperate disciplines. Thus, work on all different
aspects of constraint processing is of specific interest, including
o   constraint-satisfaction and consistency techniques,
o   constraint logic programming,
o   constraints and knowledge-representation,
o   hierarchical constraint problems,
o   relations to other fields like operations research,
o   theoretical foundations, and complexity results.

The workshop is planned as a combination of paper presentations and a
round-table discussion that shall stimulate the exchange of new ideas
and approaches among the participants.

W7   Agent theories, architectures and languages

Artificial Intelligence is ultimately about constructing intelligent
agents, and yet it is only comparatively recently that the issues
surrounding agent synthesis have entered the mainstream of AI. Despite
the undoubted interest in these issues, there is no recognised forum
for presenting work in this area: results currently appear in a
diverse range of journals and conferences, making it difficult for
researchers to meet and follow developments. The aim of this workshop
is therefore to provide a forum in which those working in the theory
or practice of software or hardware agents can meet and exchange
ideas.  Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to the
following.  o Theories: Modelling beliefs, desires, goals, intentions,
and actions; agent logics; situated automata theory.  o Architectures:
Deliberative, reactive and hybrid architectures; rationality & bounded
rationality.  o Languages: Agent specification languages, and their
execution; the agent-oriented paradigm and agent-based computing;
non-logical agent languages.

W8   Models and techniques for reuse of designs

Reusing already solved problem cases for new problems is common
practice in many application areas. This is especially true in the
area of design. In many research institutes research is being
performed to develop models and techniques to support the reuse of old
cases. The workshop will focus on two important aspects of reusing
cases.  The first aspect concerns the models and techniques needed to
find cases that are suitable to be used in the new problem. Research
issues in this area include finding suitable index structures as well
as determination of measures to assess the similarity of old cases
with respect to new problems. Secondly, the case found to be most
suitable needs to be adapted to meet new problem
specifications. Interesting issues in this respect are methods to
determine the parts that need to be changed as well as the changes
that must be made to satisfy new requirements.

W9   Artificial normative reasoning 

Artificial Normative Reasoning (ANR) is a field of AI research that is
not only concerned with "AI & Law", but also with reasoning in
paralegal and other normative domains that are governed by implicit or
explicit regulations. Examples of the latter are: loans assessment,
insurance claims, certification, etc. ANR research has roots in and
ramifications to theoretical issues in AI, in particular with the
epistemological and logical foundations of representing normative and
common sense knowledge, case based reasoning and problem solving
methods for assessment tasks. ANR is also an important field of
application, in particular as part of the intelligent automisation of
administrative institutes as banks, civil services, government,
etc. (Para-) Legal knowledge based systems (LKBSs) cover a suffiently
large market to warrant the (re)use of specialised knowledge
acquisition methodologies and tools, and the development of articulate
and dedicated system architectures. It is the objective of the
workshop to bring together both theoretical and applied perspectives,
focussing on representation formalisms, modelling of legal knowledge,
and reasoning methods.

W10   AI in finance and business 

Software applications in financial domains (such as capital
investment, credit decisions, leasing, accounting, mergers &
acquisitions, etc.) extensively involve information and knowledge
processing. However, AI techniques have not succeeded yet in
contributing to this real world challenge, because we still lack an
indepth (AI -related) methodological evaluation of the capabilities
of AI technology in this domain. The workshop will bring together AI
practioners working on financial AI applications & business
researchers and practioners who have experience in applying AI
techniques to approach their domain-related problems.

Thus, the major aims of the workshop are:
- To initiate a methodological discussion of how AI methods and
  techniques may apply to the different types of financial and
  business applications and
- To describe the knowledge elements that are fundamental to the
  financial reasoning and begin to model these elements.

W11   Algorithms, complexity and commonsense reasoning

The idea of formalizing commonsense reasoning has always been central
to the field of Artificial Intelligence in general and Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning in particular. Many different logical
formalisms have been proposed and their semantics properties carefully
analyzed. Only more recently particular attention has been devoted to
the computational complexity analysis and the development of efficient
algorithms to implement these formalisms. The aim of the workshop is
to bring together researchers and provide a forum for discussion of
current research, results, and problems of both a theoretical and
practical nature.

W12   Spatial and temporal reasoning
 
The workshop focuses on major problems facing the developers and users
of temporal and spatial models for application in all areas. The
workshop will contribute to forging a solid space/time-bridge among
the researchers in disciplines where spatio-temporal issues are a key
concern, including Distributed and Real-Time Systems, AI, and
Logic. Emphasis will be given to three particular interfaces:
o   Between spatial and temporal reasoning.
o   Between temporal methods in AI and those used to reason about
    concurrency and distributed systems.
o   Between spatio-temporal models, including those based on modal
    logics versus those using traditional logic and explicit time
    and space parameters.

W13   Comparison of implemented ontologies

The aim of the workshop is to gather those researchers who have
actually designed and implemented ontologies (limitative sets of
concepts and relations) for improved reuse and sharability of
knowledge bases.  Participants will be required to submit their
ontologies for discussion. During the workshop, attendants will be
expected to have studied these ontologies and supporting material, and
thus be in a position to discuss the merits and problems of each of
them. The outcome of the workshop may be twofold: on the one hand, an
inventory of currently usable ontologies, on the other hand a first
cut at a method for evaluating ontologies.

W14   Combining symbolic and connectionist processing

Until a few years ago, the history of AI has been marked by two
parallel, often antagonistic, streams of development: classical or
symbolic AI and connectionist processing. A recent research trend,
premissed on the complementarity of these two paradigms, strives to
build hybrid systems which combine the advantages of both to overcome
the limitations of each. For instance, attempts have been made to
accomplish complex tasks by blending neural networks with rule-based
or case-based reasoning. This workshop will be the first Europe-wide
effort to bring together researchers active in the area in view of
laying the groundwork for a theory and methodology of symbolic/
connectionist integration (SCI). The workshop will focus on the
following topics:

o   Theoretical (cognitive and computational) foundations of SCI.
o   Techniques and mechanisms for combining symbolic and connectionist
    processing.
o   Outstanding problems encountered and issues involved in SCI. 
o   Profiles of application domains in which SCI has been (or can be)
    shown to perform better than traditional approaches.
o   Description, analysis and comparison of implemented
    symbolic/connectionist systems.

W15   Decision theory for DAI applications

Describing and formalizing the decision-making of individual
problem-solving agents has turned out to be crucial for the design of
and the interaction among these agents in virtually any DAI
application. Current DAI research has targeted two basic approaches
for decision-making: the utilitarian and the symbolic approach. The
objective of the workshop is to bring together scientists working on
either approach; furthermore, the presentation of alternative
reasoning methodologies for decision- making is encouraged. Special
emphasis will be placed on the role of decision theory in the
development of practical DAI applications. In particular insight will
be provided as to how such pragmatic decision models can be introduced
into DAI systems.

W16   From theorem provers to mathematical assistants: issues and
      possible solutions
 
There is a substantial difference in spirit between automated theorem
provers and mathematical proof assistants. While the first are built
to prove theorems automatically, the latter are built to provide a
comfortable interactive environment for supporting human beings in
formal reasoning. Nowadays automated theorem provers are powerful
enough to be used in many different areas, e.g. in verifying the
software correctness. The successes in solving mathematical problems
are also very impressing. However, almost no mathematician uses such
systems as an everyday tool. Indeed, most systems have severe
drawbacks, which make them hard to use. In the workshop we want to
discuss problems that occur in the application of traditional
automated theorem provers in mathematical standard applications as
well as possible solutions to these problems.

W17   Applied genetic and other evolutionary algorithms

The growing interest for genetic and other evolutionary algorithms is
partly due to their good performance on a wide scale of problems
without being too sensitive to problem specific aspects. Practical
applications, however, sometimes raise issues outside the scope of
classical GA/EA models. The workshop is aiming at cumulating knowledge
on the application of GAs/EAs, in particular at studying issues not
(extensively) treated by standard GA/EA literature, e.g. handling of
constraints, or using new selection schemes. Topics of interest
include but are not restricted to: - problem elicitation and
representation - non-standard genotypes and recombination operators -
genetic programming - handling constraints - boosting performance -
combination with other techniques, e.g. local search, neural nets,
knowledge based systems - (dis)advantages of EAs w.r.t. other
techniques We hope that insights gained at the workshop can facilitate
further applications and support new theory.

W18   Validation of knowledge-based systems

Validation has emerged as a critical factor influencing the acceptance
of knowledge-based systems (KBS) software, and has become a
significant area of research in recent years. For this workshop, we
are interested in contributions on any of the following themes: formal
verification, empirical validation and evaluation, testing techniques,
techniques for validating hybrid software systems (integrating KBS
technology with other software technologies, AI and non-AI), and
approaches for integrating validation with other KBS life-cycle
processes (especially knowledge acquisition, refinement, and
maintenance). Within any of these themes, papers having either a
theoretical or practical flavour are equally welcome; we are
especially interested in papers that combine theory and practice.

W19   Constraint satisfaction issues raised by practical applications

The standard CSP representation and resolution techniques present some
limitations when they are confronted with practical applications. In
particular, encountered problems include:
o   Existence of explicitly-known preferences on the satisfaction of
    some constraints; 
o   Incompleteness of the specification of the problem due to
    imprecision and/or uncertainty; 
o   Dynamically evolving nature of the CSP due to changes caused by
    the user or by the external world; 
o   Hierarchical nature of the problem, due to conditional, or higher
    order constraints; 
o   Combinatorial complexity of the problem that precludes its
    complete resolution. 
 
The aims of this workshop are to present and discuss developments
along this line, especially by describing real-life applications and
problems encountered due to CSP limitations. The technical issues
addressed will concern finite domain CSPs.

ECAI94 Workshop
MODELS AND TECHNIQUES FOR REUSE OF DESIGNS
Monday 8 August 1994

The design of objects is a very complex process which is hard to
formalize due to the lack of an all encompassing theory of
design. When observing designers in practice, it has been concluded
that a large part of their activities consists of reusing design
experiences. Such experiences are related to earlier design situations
and existing design products, many of which have been proven useful in
practice.  Several research groups are currently investigating
possibilities for formalizing and codifying this experience for reuse
in new design problems.

Two major research areas can be distinguished. Firstly, existing
designs are adapted to meet new demands. The focus in such situations
is to determine parts that need to be adapted to satisfy new
requirements. These requirements may be related to the function,
physical properties of the design, or life-cycle aspects, such as
serviceability and costs. The second research area focuses on finding
existing designs that can be reused in new design problems.  Difficult
issues here include developing suitable index structures and
similarity measures.  In both research areas, models and techniques
have to be developed for structuring and representing existing designs
so that they can be reused in new situations. Furthermore, design
reuse is a relevant concept for both routine and innovative design.

In the workshop we would like to focus on methods and techniques to
support the reuse of existing design knowledge, especially methods and
techniques that have the potential to be useful in practical design
situations. The workshop is intended for researchers working in the
field of redesign and case-based reasoning in engineering domains.

The questions to be addressed are:
. What is needed to find similar designs?
. What is needed to find analogous designs?
. How can the part of the design that needs to be adapted be
  found?
. How can the complexity of the adaptation needed be determined?
. How can the consequences of the changes be determined?
. How must past design knowledge be structured and represented to
  be reusable?
. How can adaptation of designs be supported?

The outcome of the workshop may be an inventory of promising methods
and techniques for supporting case-based reasoning and redesign in
different design situations.

Workshop format:
The workshop will last one day: Monday, August 8, 1994.
To facilitate discussion, the number of attendees at the
workshop will be limited to 30. The discussion will be centered around
challenging statements to be presented by a selected number of
participants.  Each participant must register for both the workshop
and the general conference.

T1   Models of uncertainty and graduality in AI

Didier Dubois (National Center for Scientific Research, France) and
Philippe Smets (Institut de Recherches Interdisciplinaires et de
Developpements en Intelligence Artificielle, France)

Researchers in automated reasoning, in database management systems and
in knowledge-based systems have felt the need for techniques that cope
with imperfect information. This is especially true when issues such
as inconsistency handling, numerical/symbolic interface, and belief
revision are addressed. Classical logic and the Bayesian view of
probability are not always enough to deal with those issues even if
they suggest useful guidelines.

This tutorial will provide an introduction to non classical models of
uncertainty and vagueness that have been developed in the last 20
years, very often in connection with Artificial Intelligence. These
models include numerical approaches such as fuzzy sets and possibility
theory, belief functions, and more logical-oriented developments such
as nonmonotonic reasoning. The tutorial is made of four lectures
respectively devoted to a survey of various forms of imperfect
information, an introduction to fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic and
possibility theory, a comparative introduction to several belief
functions theories, and the connection between uncertainty models and
nonmonotonic inference. The tutorial will survey the various
approaches in a knowledge-based systems perspective, hoping that it
might lead potential users to a better understanding of why these
models differ, how they can be related and when to use what.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial will assume that the audience has
some knowledge of probability theory and propositional calculus.


T2 The knowledge medium
   (The use of formal knowledge representation for institutional
   memory and communication)

Thomas Gruber (Stanford University) and Luc Steels (Free University Brussels)

Computer technology has begun to redefine how human knowledge is
communicated and used in organisations. Networked multimedia systems,
which can store and display information in a variety of modalities,
are used to support the communication of virtual teams across space
and time barriers.  Knowledge systems, which do limited reasoning on
symbolic representations of knowledge, are used to deliver specialised
or complex knowledge in an operational form where it is needed. The
knowledge medium is the convergence of these two trends, in which
machine-interpretable representations are part of the medium by which
we communicate and transmit our knowledge.

This tutorial will explore the role of knowledge representation in a
medium for communication and institutional memory. Applications will
be described in which knowledge is communicated and shared in forms
understood by both humans and software agents. Examples include
interactive, model-generated documentation of designed artifacts;
content-based routing of information among collaborating agents; and
the synthesis of knowledge-based software from libraries of reusable
components. Fundamental research issues to be discussed include the
design and use of shared representations, and knowledge level
specifications of tasks, agent capabilities, and information needs.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is intended for researchers and
practitioners interested in new applications of AI to problems of
enterprise integration, computer-supported communication, software
reuse, and software interoperability.  Only a basic familiarity with
knowledge representation and software engineering will be assumed.


T3   Intelligent multimedia interfaces

Mark Maybury (MITRE Corporation, Badford, MA, USA) and Yigal Arens
(University of Southern California)

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the emerging literature
and set of techniques for building multimedia and multimodal
interfaces, i.e., those interfaces that interpret and generate
multiple media, e.g., spoken and written natural language, graphics,
non-speech audio, maps, animation). This tutorial will last a half day
and will be primarily a lecture, with time allotted to clarify issues
and respond to questions from the audience.

This tutorial will begin by motivating the value of a system that is
able to communicate using multiple media and modalities using examples
found in human-human communication. We define terms and note
terminological problems found in the literature, then describe an
architecture for integrated multimedia parsing and generation, which
will serve as a reference model for the remainder of the tutorial. We
next distinguish the specific kinds of knowledge utilised by these
systems and then describe the theory, illustrated with implemented
application examples, of multimedia parsing and generation. Finally,
we discuss systems that have integrated both parsing and
generation. The tutorial concludes by outlining key areas for further
research and expected future directions in the field. Throughout the
tutorial, specific descriptions of prototype systems (e.g., from the
MIT Media Lab, USC/ISI, Columbia University, the German Center for
Research in AI, IRST) will be used to illustrate the components of a
more general model of multimodal and multimedia communication.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is relevant to those researchers
and practitioners interested in investigating, designing, and
implementing intelligent interfaces that exploit multiple media and
modalities to facilitate human- computer interaction. There is no
prerequisite knowledge required, although general knowledge of user
interfaces and artificial intelligence will enhance the value of this
course for participants.


T4   Reasoning with cases: theory and practice

Klaus-Dieter Althoff (University of Kaiserslautern), Michel Manago
(AcknoSoft, France), Stefan Wess (University of Kaiserslautern)

The objective of the tutorial is to present two technologies for
reasoning with cases: induction and case-based reasoning. Induction is
a form of machine learning that is used to automatically extract
general knowledge (for instance in the form of a decision tree or a
set of rules) from a database of cases. Case-based reasoning is a
problem solving method that makes direct use of past experiences
(cases) rather than a corpus of general knowledge such as rules.

In this tutorial, we will show how reasoning with cases helps solve a
new category of applications and how it also offers an alternative to
classical rule-based reasoning. We will introduce, compare and
contrast the two technologies, expose the history and areas of current
research, present the architecture of a case-based reasoning system
and describe some basic algorithms. We will show how cases can be
indexed for efficient retrieval, how the similarity between new and
past cases is assessed, how cases are represented (feature-value
vectors, object representations), how to use additional background
domain knowledge, and we will compare the technologies with other
forms of automated reasoning.

Induction and case-based reasoning are now mature technologies that
have reached the market. Strategic custom applications in various
domains have been delivered (and are being used) and "off the shelf"
products are available. We will review tools developed by commercial
and non-commercial organisations, identify the market for these and
show some real applications in technical maintenance and diagnosis.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial aims at presenting a survey of
the technologies and delineating their areas of application. The
intended audience is composed of the managing and technical staff of
computer divisions interested in technologies for reasoning with
cases. Knowledge engineers interested in up-to-date methodologies for
developing applications and users with a specific potential
application in mind will also appreciate the tutorial. There are no
prerequisites.


T5   The art and the science of modelling:
     (crucial issues in building second generation knowledge-based systems)

Peter Struss (Technical University of Munich) and Bert Bredeweg
(University of Amsterdam)

Reasoning about the physical world has always been a key problem in
AI. It is in the core of common sense reasoning, and it is central to
many automated problems solvers that are intended to deal with
industrial applications. Recently, model-based systems have become a
focal point of both theoretical work and efforts to build powerful
systems, and the field is now mature for significant applications.
Designing an adequate model for the domain and task at hand is the key
problem and step. The quality of the model crucially effects the
competence and robustness of the problem solving system, the
generality and reusability of the knowledge base (and, hence,
development costs) the interaction with the system and its performance
(e.g.  real-time behaviour). The research efforts of the last fifteen
years or so result in a vast set of powerful theories, useful
techniques, and sophisticated systems which is hard to overlook for
the practioner and the newcomer to the field, and, still, much of
successful modeling appears to be more like an art rather than an
engineering task. The tutorial provides a critical overview of the
field. It discusses requirements and objectives in modeling for
knowledge-based systems, the existing formal theories and tools as
well as their limitations and open problems. We will organise it along
a number of key problems, questions, and requirements raised by real
domains and applications, and analyze how different theories and
techniques address these issues. Examples deal with design and
configuration, failure mode analysis, simulation, analysis, testing,
sensor placement, diagnosis and repair, supervision, explanation and
tutoring and treat physical systems, biological and ecological
systems, and enterprises.

Prerequisite knowledge: The tutorial is intended for developers of
industrial applications as well as novices in the field and
researchers from other AI areas. The former should receive help for
finding solutions to their problems, while the latter may find what is
worth while working on. No extensive knowledge in AI is required for
attending. Some basic knowledge in mathematics, logic, knowledge
representation, and reasoning is helpful, but not mandatory.


T6   Validation of knowledge-based systems

Pedro Meseguer (Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona) and Alun
Preece (University of Savoie, France)

This tutorial will provide participants with a firm understanding of
the current state-of-the-art in techniques and tools for validating
knowledge-based systems (KBS). Highlights of the presentation will
include a detailed examination of methods for performing rigorous
verification, testing and evaluation of these systems. Our intention
is to give attendees a solid introduction to the theoretical
foundation of KBS validation methods, together with a clear
understanding of how the methods can be applied in practice. Our
analysis of KBS verification tools and techniques will cover not only
classical rule-based systems, but also systems with uncertainty,
explicit control knowledge, frames, and procedural components. We will
describe the underlying algorithms, and will draw upon practical
experience to consider issues arising in the use of verification
tools---for example, how to interpret their output. A thorough survey
of testing techniques for KBS will include both an assessment of the
applicability of testing approaches from software engineering, and an
examination of special problems in testing KBS. We will also consider
broader issues in KBS evaluation, concerned with ensuring that a
delivered system will be used productively. All of these techniques
will be illustrated using case studies from KBS practice. Finally, we
place the validation activities in context by relating them to other
activities in the KBS life-cycle, and also by relating them to other
important topics in artificial intelligence. Participants will leave
this tutorial with a set of recommendations for carrying out rigorous
and effective validation to ensure the quality of their KBS.

Prerequisite Knowledge: Participants in this tutorial should be
familiar with knowledge-based systems, at least to the level of an
introductory textbook. The tutorial is aimed at participants with an
interest in quality assurance of KBS, especially systems builders or
managers currently involved--or anticipating involvement--in
developing KBS.


T7 Managing machine-learning application development and
   organisational implementation

Yves Kodratoff (University of Paris-Sud) and Vassilis Moustakis
(Technical University of Crete, Greece)

Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to Industry is made at once
difficult by the large amount of available techniques and programs
that are able to perform induction or support learning of some
kind. It also represents a challenge both in terms of the application
and of ML itself in that a great proportion of the user community is
torn between the hopes and promises brought about by innovations in ML
science and technology on the one hand and their need to understand,
and, ultimately use these innovations to support knowledge based
system (KBS) tasks on the other.  The tutorial will cover all phases
underlying (ML) application development. Special emphasis will be
placed upon lessons learned from existing industrial `real world' ML
applications. From a technical point of view the tutorial will address
the issue of coupling application specifics with ML systems. It will
suggest a systematic framework, sufficient for supporting ML
application management and ML system selection according to
application requirements. It will also emphasise the numerous problems
met when Knowledge Acquisition has to be coupled with ML: most
existing industrialised ML applications had to perform the acquisition
of the knowledge necessary to have the ML system running.

The tutorial will adopt an application bias in reviewing the
conditions under which a given ML technique should be applied. Results
are demonstrated by way of a series of real world ML application case
studies.  The tutorial should be useful to both ML researchers and ML
practitioners. ML practitioners will get an overview of ML system
capabilities and potential in addition to having a chance to learn
about real world applications. ML researchers may find this tutorial
useful in understanding reality of applications and identify gaps
pointing to the need for further system development or enhancement.

Prerequisite Knowledge: Participants who want to attend this tutorial
should possess a minimum of AI skills. Acquaintance with machine
learning is desirable although not necessary.


T8 Knowledge-based production management

Norman M. Sadeh and Stephen F. Smith (Carnegie Mellon's Robotics
Institute, Pittsburgh)

This tutorial will introduce participants to the concepts, techniques,
and methodologies that have emerged from work in knowledge-based
production management. We will first consider the shortcomings of
traditional approaches to production management (e.g., MRP/MRP II) and
identify opportunities provided by knowledge-based technologies both
in overcoming these limitations, and in contributing to effective
implementation of modern manufacturing philosophies (e.g. Just in
Time).  We will then review in more detail the essential concepts and
techniques underlying dominant approaches to knowledge-based
production management. We will cover object-centered modeling
frameworks, simulation and rule-based techniques, temporal constraint
management, blackboard and multi-perspective techniques, constrained
heuristic search, uncertainty management, iterative improvement
techniques, distributed production management, and intelligent
interactive scheduling frameworks. In each case, we will characterise
strengths and weaknesses from the standpoint of different production
management requirements, and indicate the results that work under each
approach has produced to date.  Finally, we will examine a few
successful applications, and assess the current state of theory and
practice.

Over the past decade, a large (and continually increasing) number of
efforts (both research and development) have sought to investigate and
exploit the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts and
techniques in production management applications. In some cases,
AI-based concepts have provided frameworks for making traditional
Operations Research (OR) techniques more accessible and usable in
practical production management settings. In other cases, novel
concepts and techniques have been developed that offer new
opportunities for more cost-effective factory
performance. Knowledge-based scheduling and planning techniques are
having an increasing operational impact in complex production
management applications.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is aimed at both practitioners
and researchers who are interested in applying knowledge-based
techniques to practical production management problems. It will also
be useful to technology managers who want to keep abreast of the
current state of the art in knowledge-based production management. The
tutorial assumes knowledge of AI at the level of an introductory
course as well as some familiarity with basic production management
concepts.


T9   Multi-agent systems and distributed AI

Les Gasser (University of Southern California) and Jeffrey
S. Rosenschein (Hebrew University Jerusalem)

Multi-Agent Systems and Distributed AI (MAS/DAI) are concerned with
how to coordinate behaviour among a collection of semi-autonomous
problem-solving agents, so that they can act together to solve joint
problems, or make individually or globally reasonable decisions
despite uncertainty and conflict.  MAS/DAI systems are a research
reality, and are rapidly becoming practical partners in critical tasks
such as telecommunications control and management, power distribution,
product development, manufacturing, robotics, enterprise
integration/coordination, and organization design.

This tutorial will provide a thorough survey of problems, theory,
techniques and applications in contemporary Multi-Agent Systems and
Distributed AI. We will develop a comprehensive picture of current
knowledge and contemporary currents in MAS/DAI, in preparation for
building MAS/DAI systems or as background for doing advanced research
on outstanding MAS/DAI problems. The tutorial is designed for people
who are professionally interested in building MAS/DAI systems, for AI
researchers interested in learning about a range of MAS/DAI
approaches, and for technology planners and managers who need to know
about leading-edge technologies.

Prerequisite Knowledge:
The tutorial presumes knowledge of AI at the level of an introductory
AI course.


T10   Temporal reasoning in AI

Han Reichgelt (University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica) and
Lluis Vila (Institute for Research in AI of Blanes, Spain)

The notion of time is ubiquitous in any activity that requires
intelligence. A whole range of intelligent tasks require reasoning
about time like Diagnosis, Explanation, Planning, Process supervision,
Natural language understanding. It follows that the representation of
time and reasoning about time is of crucial importance for Artificial
Intelligence systems. This tutorial is intended to demonstrate it, to
give a clear picture of the different issues involved in a temporal
reasoning system, and to provide a progressively detailed analysis of
each of these different issues discussing the advantages and
shortcomings of the different approaches in the literature. The
tutorial will be comprised of the following sessions:
  Introduction,
  What is temporal reasoning?,
  Why it is so important?,
  How it can be used in practice?,
  Ontologies of time,
  How should time be conceptualised, e.g. as points or as intervals?,
  What are the advantages of each conceptualisation?,
  Temporal logics,
  Method of temporal arguments,
  Modal temporal logic,
  Reified temporal logic,
  Critical comparison of the three 
  Algorithms for temporal reasoning,
  Change, causality and non-monotonicity.    

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial will assume some basic
understanding of first-order predicate calculus. However, it will
assume no in-depth knowledge of the field of temporal reasoning. It is
our intention to present both introductory and in-depth material. The
tutorial will therefore be suitable both to complete novices in the
field and those with some background in the area.


T11   Rules in databases and knowledge bases

Ulrike Griefahn and Rainer Manthey (University of Bonn)

Rules have been a well-known concept in artificial intelligence since
long, investigated in connection with expert systems, knowledge bases,
or logic programming. Various instances of the rule concept were later
adopted by the database community in view of extending AI techniques
towards the handling of large amounts of data. Today there are two
major directions of activity in database research which are concerned
with the introduction of rules into database systems: active and
deductive databases.  Meanwhile, a significant amount of
database-specific techniques have been developed. These approaches are
relevant for research in AI, too, as many of today's expert system
applications are related to large quantities of data. But even in case
of comparatively small amounts of data, not necessarily requiring
database technology, some of the techniques developed in the DB
community seem to be interesting alternatives to "classical" AI
solutions.  The tutorial aims at providing a compact, up-to-date
overview of the state-of-the-art in active and deductive databases. In
addition, first results towards an integration of both kinds of rules
within a common framework are presented, focusing on the
implementation of deductive inference by means of active rules.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The presenters try to keep the tutorial
largely self-contained. However, basic knowledge about databases
(primarily relational databases), logic programming, and expert
systems are helpful.


T12   Principles and practice of knowledge acquisition

Angel R. Puerta (Stanford University) and Henrik Eriksson (Linkoeping
University)

Knowledge acquisition draws from many research areas. Due to the
complexity of the fields involved, it is often more productive to
examine knowledge acquisition from an empirical point of view, than to
do so from a purely theoretical one. This tutorial will develop a
comprehensive view of the most important principles and practical
issues in knowledge acquisition. We will present the theoretical
foundations of knowledge acquisition to establish a framework in which
the attendee can understand and analyze how the theories are put to
practice. We will concentrate on illustrating problems in using
computer-based knowledge- acquisition tools, covering examples from
early expert systems to the new generation of knowledge- based systems
based on reusable knowledge components. Throughout the tutorial, we
will emphasise the particular issues that affect the design and
development of knowledge-acquisition tools. The attendee will learn
what principles and design tradeoffs are involved in the construction
of knowledge-acquisition tools, and what are the research issues in
knowledge acquisition.

Prerequisite Knowledge: This tutorial is suited for anyone who has an
introductory background in artificial intelligence. The course will be
especially helpful to knowledge engineers involved in the development
of knowledge-based systems, to research scientists who work with
knowledge bases, and to anyone desiring an overview of the advances in
knowledge acquisition.


T13a and T13b   Artificial life and autonomous robots 

Luc Steels and assistants (Free University Brussels) and
David McFarland (University of Oxford)

This tutorial is a unique opportunity for AI researchers to get an
overview of the newly developing paradigm of behaviour-oriented AI and
to understand the approach in sufficient technical detail. This
tutorial consists of two parts: the first part is given in the morning
and is particularly important for the necessary background and
motivation (Steels and McFarland). The second part is given in the
afternoon and will give hands-on experience, and potentially will give
researchers the chance to continue working in this area (Steels and
assistants). Artificial Life studies the phenomenon of life the same
way AI studies intelligence: by building artificial systems that show
the same capabilities as living systems. This tutorial gives an
overview of research in Alife, the behaviour-oriented approach to AI,
and the biological significance of this research. The first tutorial
is theoretical. An overview of the literature will be given and
important general trends discussed. The second tutorial focuses on
technical issues. An autonomous robot lab will be set up in which
participants have the opportunity to build their own robots out of
components made available in the lab. The secon tutorial will be
restricted to a smaller audience.

Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial is intended for researchers or
developers in any area of AI that want to learn about the new exciting
developments in behaviour-oriented AI research and its interaction
with Artificial Life. There are no prerequisites beyond general
knowledge about AI. The second tutorial requires general programming
experience but no prior experience in robot building.
