			   ***CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT***




Dates: May 18th - 19th, 1994


Location:  Chauncey Conference Center
	   Educational Testing Service
	   Rosedale Road
	   Princeton,  New Jersey  08541
	  



Conference Purpose:



	   Natural Language Processing Techniques have been found to be 
	   increasingly useful in the domains of assessment and education.  
	   The purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers from 
	   both the NLP, and assessment and education communities and to 
	   share ideas about how NLP techniques can be implemented 
	   to aid in tasks for assessment and education.  Speakers are being 
	   invited from industry and academia to discuss their research and applications 
	   of NLP in assessment and education.  We anticipate that the conference
	   will encourage on-going discussion between the NLP, and assessment and
	   education communities.
      
	   Topics:

	   * NLP Techniques for Assessment of Natural Language Responses to Test Items
	   * Computer-Aided Design in Education
	   * Automatic Spelling Correction for Automated Scoring of Natural Language Responses
	   * Intelligent Tutors

	  The conference will be held at the Chauncey Conference Center on ETS' Princeton 
	  campus. Chauncey Conference Center has rooms for conference guests who choose to 
	  stay overnight. The price of the conference varies depending on the type of 
          accommodations requested.
