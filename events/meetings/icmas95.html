CALL FOR PAPERS

First International Conference on Multiagent Systems - ICMAS '95

June 12 - 14, 1995
San Francisco, California

	Multiagent Systems are computational systems in which several semi-autonomous
agents interact or work together to perform some set of  tasks or satisfying
some set of goals. These systems may involve  computational agents that are
homogeneous or heterogeneous, they may  involve activity on the part of agents
having common goals or goals that  are distinct, and they may involve
participation on the part of humans  and intelligent computational agents.
Research and practice on these  systems generally focuses on problem solving,
communication, and coordination aspects, as distinct from low-level
parallelization or synchronization issues that are more the focus of distributed
computing.

     The design, implementation, and assessment of multiagent systems raises
many specific issues.  These include how to develop coordination strategies that
enable groups of agents to solve problems effectively, negotiation mechanisms
that serve to bring a collection of agents to an acceptable state, conflict
detection and resolution strategies, protocols by which agents may communicate
and reason about inter-agent communications, and mechanisms whereby agents can
maintain autonomy while still contributing to overall system effectiveness.

      Researchers and developers in many areas of the world have contributed to
multiagent systems over the last decade.  The First International Conference on
Multiagent Systems will be held in June of 1995 in San Francisco.  Organized as
a joint effort of the North American Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)
community, the Japanese Multi-Agent and Cooperative Computing (MACC) community,
and the European Modeling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World (MAAMAW)
community, this conference solicits papers concerning multiagent systems.

	ICMAS-95 will be a three-day conference combining a strong technical program of
submitted papers with plenary sessions that serve to encourage synthesis of
ideas from multiple segments of this interdisciplinary area. There will also be
tutorials presented on June 11, the day before the official start of the
conference. The program committee wishes to encourage representation of a broad
spectrum of perspectives in the conference program.  Topics of interest include
but are not limited to:


      Agent architectures
      Artificial life (from a multiagent perspective)
      Believable Agents
      Cooperation, coordination, and conflict
      Communication issues
      Conceptual and theoretical foundations of multiagent systems
      Development and engineering methodologies
      Distributed artificial intelligence
      Distributed consensus and algorithms for multiagent
           interaction
      Distributed search
      Evaluation of multi-agent systems
      Integrated testbeds and development environments
      Intelligent agents in enterprise integration systems
           and similar types of applications
      Multiagent cooperative reasoning from distributed heterogeneous
           databases
      Multiagent planning and planning for multiagent worlds
      Negotiation strategies - in both competitive and cooperative
           situations
      Organization, organizational knowledge, and organization self-design
      Practical applications of multi-agent systems (enterprises,
           robotics, sensing, manufacturing, IVHS etc.)
      Resource allocation in multiagent systems
      Social structures and their significance in multiagent systems
      User interface issues for multiagent systems



Submissions

      Authors should submit five (5) copies of papers and an email  version of
the abstract by December 1, 1994 to one of the conference  co-chairs.  All
papers will be reviewed by the program committee and  authors will be notified
of acceptance by March 1, 1995. Each paper  should clearly indicate the nature
of its scientific contribution, and  the problems, domains, or environments to
which it is applicable.


Paper Format for Review

	Submitted papers must be printed on 8 1/2" x 11"or A4 paper using  12 point
type (10 characters per inch for typewriters).  Each page must  have no more
than 38 lines and an average of 75 characters per line.  (This corresponds to
LaTex article style, 12 point.)  Each paper should have a single title page
which includes a 150-word abstract and up to two topic  areas covered by the
paper.  (These will be used to focus reviewing and  ultimately to structure the
technical program.)  The body of the paper,  including all figures, tables, and
diagrams but excluding title page and  bibliography must be no more than 12
pages in length.  Papers that do not conform to these guidelines will be
rejected without review and no electronic submissions will be accepted.

Up-to-date Information

	A Mosaic page (http://ICMAS.cs.umass.edu/ICMAS) can be accessed for the most
update information on the conference including as it becomes available
information on hotel and travel arrangements, tutorials and the technical
program.

Hotel Arrangements

	The conference will be held at San Francisco Hilton and Towers (415-771-1400 or
800-HILTONS).  There are a block of rooms set aside for conference participants
at a special convention rate till May 11,1995. Reservations received after this
date will be accepted based on availability. Please indicate when you are making
room arrangements that you will be attending the International Conference on
Multiagent Systems  in order to get the convention rate.
