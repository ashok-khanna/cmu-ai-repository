The Eighth Annual Florida AI Research Symposium seeks high quality inter-
national submissions in all areas of AI.  We are especially interested in 
papers describing knowledge-based approaches to the construction of intelligent
systems.  We construe a system to be "knowledge-based" when its behavior 
depends largely on accessed or encoded information.  The symposium will strive
for a balance between theory and practice.  All accepted papers will appear in
the conference proceedings.

SUBMISSIONS

Authors must submit 6 copies of an extended abstract of 1200 to 1600 words.
The extended abstract should not identify the author(s) in any manner.  Please
include one separate cover page containing the title, topic area, and name, 
address, phone number, and affiliation of each author.  In cases of multiple
authors all correspondence will be sent to the first author unless otherwise
requested.

Abstracts must be received by October 17, 1994.  Abstracts received after this
date will not be considered.  The Program Committee's decisions will be mailed
during early January of 1995.  Authors of accepted papers will be expected to
submit the final camera-ready copy of theirs full papers by March 1, 1995.
Final papers may consist of at most 5 galley pages (approximately 10 double 
spaced pages).
