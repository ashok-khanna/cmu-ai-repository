During the German Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Saarbruecken, 
September 18-23, 1994, the Special Interest Group "Connectionism" of the
German Society of Computer Science (GI) organizes a workshop

	Integration of Neural and Knowledge-Based Approaches

During the last years there was considerable research to integrate
neural and symbolic methods. Connectionist methods and neural networks
are especially successful for the recognition of noisy patterns and
unknown functional dependencies, while techniques of symbolic AI allow
variable binding and context switching in a simple way. Integrating
symbol-oriented AI-concepts with neural networks can preserve the
advantages of both approaches. The workshop is intended as a forum for the discussion of this topic. 

Examples of relevant research questions are:
-  How can prior knowledge be included in neural networks?
-  How can existing knowledge-based systems be improved by neural networks?
-  How can structural knowledge be interpreted in connection with neural
   learning procedures?
-  What is the relation between the combined system and its components?
-  How can combined systems be interpreted in the view of system science
   and cognitive science?


Contributors should send an extended summary of 4 pages to the
organizers by email (as postscript files) or by mail before May 1,
1994.  Befor May 15th they will get a notification of acceptance. The
final version of the papers have to be submitted before July 31, 1994
and will be published in the conference proceedings.
