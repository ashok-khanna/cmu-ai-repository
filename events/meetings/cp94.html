                               CALL FOR PAPERS
  
                      WORKSHOP ON CONSTRAINT PROCESSING

		               August 8th, 1994
  
            A one-day workshop to be held in conjunction with the
	  
	11th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'94)
               Amsterdam, The Netherlands, August 8-12th, 1994
   
     An increasing number of researchers all over the world are now dealing 
   with different  aspects of constraint processing  regarded as a  general 
   paradigm  of computation.  However, the constraint processing  community 
   appears to be  very heterogeneous:   Researchers from logic programming, 
   knowledge representation,  expert systems, theoretical computer science,  
   operations research  and other  related fields are investigating the use 
   of constraint processing methods, their theoretical foundations, as well 
   as their applications  to real-life problems.  Each of these communities 
   has its own subgroup dealing with constraint processing issues,  some of 
   them with specialized meetings, workshops, mailing lists etc. But, up to 
   now there has not been much effort to bring together researchers working 
   on or interested in constraint processing  from different viewpoints and 
   to work out the common principles,  vocabulary,  and techniques that are 
   used as well as similarities and differences between various viewpoints.
   
     Continuing the efforts  that started with the  workshop on  constraint 
   processing at CSAM'93 in St. Petersburg (Russia) on July 20th-21st, 1993 
   this workshop aims at bringing together researchers working on different 
   aspects  of  constraint  processing  in order  to exchange,  compare and 
   contrast  basic  viewpoints,  different  approaches and  recent research 
   results.  Thus, the workshop is planned  as an interdisciplinary meeting 
   of  researchers as well as practitioners with an  active interest in the 
   area of constraint processing. It will provide an international forum to 
   discuss and exchange  new ideas and approaches,  and to present not only  
   full-blown research papers but also partial results, position papers and 
   reports on ongoing research. By that, it is hoped that a fruitful cross-
   fertilization among the various disciplines will result.
      
     Work on all different aspects of constraint processing  is of specific 
   interest for the workshop, including
   
     *  constraint-satisfaction methods and consistency techniques,
     *  constraint logic programming,
     *  concurrent constraint languages,
     *  constraints and knowledge representation,
     *  object-oriented constraint processing,
     *  constraint programming,
     *  constraint maintenance,
     *  constraints identification, specification, management and
        implementation techniques,
     *  over-specified constraint problems and constraint relaxation,
     *  creation and execution of constraint-satisfaction plans,
     *  constraint refinement,
     *  hierarchical constraint problems,
     *  parallel and distributed computing with constraints,
     *  finite (discrete) as well as continous domain handling,
     *  real-time constraints,
     *  relations to operations research or deductive databases, 
     *  constraint processing in computer graphics, 
     *  theoretical foundations, 
     *  complexity results, and
     *  reports showing the practical relevance of constraint processing
	and what basic techniques are needed in practice.
   
   WORKSHOP FORMAT 
   
     The workshop is planned as a combination of presentations of submitted 
   papers and a round-table discussion that shall stimulate the exchange of  
   new ideas and approaches among the workshop participants.  
   
   PAPER SUBMISSION
   
     People interested in giving a presentation at the workshop are invited 
   to submit an extended abstract (no more than eight pages, single-spaced, 
   one column, 12pt),  preferably by e-mail (LaTeX/PostScript are welcome).  
   Authors not having e-mail access  should send 4 copies.  Persons wishing  
   to participate without giving a presentation  should submit a brief (one
   page) abstract describing  their research and/or interest  in constraint 
   processing. However, priority will be given to people submitting papers.
   
     Submissions should arrive before April 14th, 1994 at the address given 
   below.  Notification of receipt will  be mailed to the  first author (or 
   designated author).  On the first page include  the name, address, phone 
   and fax number, and e-mail address of the author designated for contact. 
   Notifications of acceptance will be mailed by May 16th, 1994. Authors of 
   accepted papers  will be invited to submit full papers of up to 15 pages 
   by June 8th, 1994  to be included  in the workshop notes  distributed to 
   all participants.  It is also planned to publish a collection of revised  
   versions of the  best papers in book format including feedback  from the 
   workshop. Please send your submissions and inquiries to:
