International Workshop on Applications of 
Neural Networks to Telecommunications

Nassau Inn, Princeton, NJ
October 18-20, 1993

You are invited to an international workshop on applications 
of neural networks to problems in telecommunications.
The workshop will be held at the historic Nassau Inn  (across from
the university) in Princeton, New Jersey on October, 18-20 1993.

The conference rate is $95 single, $135 double.  You can make reservations
directly with the hotel (mention IWANNT*93):

Nassau Inn
10 Palmer Square
Princeton, NJ 08542
(800) 862-7728 (within USA)
(609) 921-7500 (outside USA)
(609) 921-9385 (FAX)

In addition to the traditional hard-bound proceedings, we will also
have an on-line electronic conference proceedings.  This will have
automatic indexing and cross-referencing, multimedia figures,
and annotations for readers and authors to comment.
