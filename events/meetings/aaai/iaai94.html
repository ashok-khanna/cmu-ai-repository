The Sixth Annual Innovative Applications of Artificial
Intelligence Conference Call for Papers, Panels, and Tutorials

Seattle, Washington, July 31 - August 3

Sponsored by the American Association for Artificial
Intelligence 

Call for Papers, Panels & Tutorials

Intelligent systems are becoming a reality for many enterprises
in the 1990s. But rather than being independent technologies,
these systems are being used as one component in a complex
system. The purpose of the Sixth Annual Conference on
Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence is to
explore how such systems are being used as enabling
technologies. Through case studies, meet-the-author sessions,
and interactive panel discussions, the conference will showcase
and promote AI technology at work in todayUs global
enterprises. It will highlight the most innovative deployed AI
applications world-wide and explore critical issues involved in
AI development and deployment. Successful authors will receive
the Annual Innovative Applications Award and will be
highlighted in AI Magazine. 

-  Elizabeth Byrnes, Program Chair
-  Jan Aikins, Program Cochair 

IAAI Case Study Papers 

Case-study presentation papers, highlighting any area of AI
technology, must describe deployed applications with measurable
benefits. Papers should be 5-10 pages in length, plus figures.
The proceedings on the conference will be published by AAAI
Press; authors will be required to transfer copyright.

We suggest that your case study cover the following topics:

Task or Problem Description: Describe the task the application
performs or the problem it solves. State the objectives of the
application and explain why an AI solution was important. If
other solutions were tried and failed, outline these solutions
and the reasons for their failure.

Application Description: Describe the application, providing
technical details about design and implementation. What key
aspects of AI technology enabled the application to succeed? If
applicable, describe how AI technology is integrated with other
technology. If an AI shell or product is used, explain the
decision criteria used to select it. Describe any insights
gained about the application of AI technology.

Application Use and Payoff: How long has this application been
deployed? Explain how widely, how often, and by whom the
application is being used. Also describe the applicationUs
payoff. What measurable benefits have resulted from its use?
What additional benefits do you expect over time?

Application Development and Deployment: Describe the
development and deployment processes. How long did they take?
How many developers were involved? What were the costs? 

Maintenance: Describe your experience with and plans for
maintenance of the application. Who maintains the knowledge
base? How often is update needed? Is knowledge in this domain
expected to change over time? How does the design of the
application facilitate update? Have you automated
knowledge-base update in any way?

AI-On-Line Panels

The AI-on-Line panels will focus on critical issues involved in
AI development and deployment. This series of panels will
explore important issues involved in delivering effective and
successful AI systems.

Each panel should address a practical problem or theme of broad
interest to developers of AI applications. Panelists should
focus on specific issues, such as problems and solutions,
technical trade-offs, managerial issues, organizational
concerns, and challenges for the future. Case studies can be
used to illustrate the issues, but should not be the principal
focus of the panel presentations. 

Panel proposals should include a description of the sessions,
the name and full address and phone of the principal contact of
the organizer, the name of the proposed panel moderator, and a
list of proposed panelists. Panel proposals will be judged
based on the importance and relevance of the proposed topic,
and on the range and experience of the proposed panelists.

Panel Topics

The following topics are suggestions of panels
that would be of particular interest to our audience:  

-  AI and business process reengineering 

-  Five-year forecasts--how will intelligent business
applications look? 

-  Will computers ever really be smart?  

-  Beyond expert systems: WhatUs happening in voice, speech,
and machine learning? 

Tutorials 

The theme of the 1994 Tutorial Program is "Real World
Applications of Theoretically Well-Founded AI Concepts and
Methods." Tutorials should provide practical training in an
area, but should not promote or be devoted to a single product.

Proposals for tutorials should contain a detailed outline of
the tutorial, including its goals, description, and
prerequisite knowledge. Presenters should also include a
detailed vita. Contact the AAAI office or Devika Subramanian
(607/255-9189; Fax: 607/255-4428; email: devika@cs.
cornell.edu) for further information about tutorials. The
deadline for tutorial proposals is November 1, 1993.

Timetable

Submit five (5) clearly legible complete copies of papers or
panel proposals (hard copies only--we cannot accept computer
files) to the AAAI office by January 17, 1994. Papers or
proposals received after this date will be returned unopened.
Notification of receipt will be mailed to the first author (or
designated author) soon after receipt. All inquiries regarding
lost papers must be made by January 24, 1994.

Papers and panel proposals will be reviewed by the Program
Committee in March and notification of acceptance or rejection
will be mailed to the first author (or designated author) by
March 14, 1994. Camera-ready copy of accepted papers will be
due about one month later.
