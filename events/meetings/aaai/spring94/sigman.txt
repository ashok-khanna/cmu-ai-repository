SIGMAN Workshop on Detecting and Resolving Errors in Manufacturing Systems
		   AAAI 1994 Spring Symposium Series
		            March 21-23, 1994
		   Stanford University, California

This symposium will bring together researchers working on troubleshooting,
diagnosis, monitoring, and recovery from errors in manufacturing
applications.  The main purpose is to bring together people from
manufacturing with people from AI to discuss how AI techniques and
methodologies can be used to address the problems of detecting and
resolving errors.  The symposium will provide a forum for reviewing the
state of the art and for proposing new avenues of exploration.

Any system designed to perform a manufacturing task must have ways of
detecting and recovering from errors.  Timely detection of anomalies in
the behavior of the system is essential for its continuous safe
operation.  This involves preventing or minimizing the occurrence of
faults through robust design, detecting abnormal conditions, isolating
faults, and finding ways of maintaining safe operation despite the
presence of faults.  The manufacturing environment is often sufficiently
uncertain and dynamic, and the manufacturing systems are sufficiently
complex to make detection and recovery from errors a major task.  The
purpose of this symposium is to analyze these issues and propose how to 
create manufacturing systems able to achieve their tasks despite 
unpredicted contingencies.

Area of interest include (but are not limited to): 
- reliability technology (reliability analysis, fault trees, event trees, etc)
- monitoring (model-based monitoring, fault-model based monitoring, 
  detection of trends and prediction of anomalies, etc)
- error detection (sensor modeling, recognition of abnormal conditions,
  sensor interpretation, etc)
- error analysis (explanation of failures, causal modeling, troubleshooting
  techniques, etc)
- planning (sensor planning, repairing plans that fail, generation of recovery 
  procedures, etc)
- scheduling (generating robust schedules, detecting and recovering from
  schedule execution errors, etc)

Papers addressing these and related issues in the area of manufacturing
will be considered.  Work in progress, innovative ideas, field based
studies, experimental results in real manufacturing environments, and
completed projects will be of interest.  Both practical and theoretical
work is welcome, but preference will be given to descriptions of
implemented systems.  The best papers will be consider for a special issue
of a journal and/or a book on this subject.

Those interested in attending should submit an abstract or short position
paper, three pages maximum.  Please submit three copies (hardcopy
submission only!) by October 15, 1993 to:
