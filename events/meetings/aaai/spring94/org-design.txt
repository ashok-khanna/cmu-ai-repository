	 Call for participation in the AAAI-94 Spring Symposium

				   on

		     COMPUTATIONAL ORGANIZATION DESIGN

				   at

		   Stanford University, March 21-23, 1994



Modern private and public organizations are facing immense pressures
to rapidly reconfigure their processes, products, and relationships
with other organizations.  The cross-functional complexity of these
changes - including their impacts on the technologies that
organizations use, the structures of organizations, and the
integration of human and cognitive issues such as skill requirements,
cognitive loads, and performance management systems - is immense.  AI
has found numerous applications in supporting decision-making in
organizations, but few in managing the complex issues of
organizational design, analysis, re-configuration, re-engineering, and
process change.  The problem of capturing and managing this complexity
cries out for computational design/analysis support, much in the way
that other large, complex design and analysis problems (e.g.,
architectural design, engineering design) have been supported by
automated assistance.

At the same time, organization theories and design approaches have
reached a degree of maturity that they can profitably be brought
together in the new enterprise of supporting the reconfiguration of
organizations. This new avenue, which we call Computational
Organization Design, encompasses both the theoretical, practical, and
methodological aspects of AI, design, and organization theory.  The
scope of Computational Organization Design encompasses both the design
of human organizations, the design of automated organizations such as
intelligent networks, and the design of highly-integrated
human-technology organizations in which there is an integrated
division of labor between people and computing.

COD is an important research area and an interesting and promising
class of abstract design problems.  Key research questions include:

	How can Design Process Models (DPMs), for organizational design, be
	characterized, identified and verified ?  A DPM is an explicit
	model of the activities carried out while creating a design.
	Adopting a particular DPM amounts to making the hypothesis
	that, over a collection of design problems, applying the DPM
	will generate a useful percentage of highly-evaluated
	acceptable designs with acceptable levels of effort.

	Can AI, with its unique capabilities for rigorous, qualitative
	inference, provide powerful new capabilities to formalize and
	execute organization theory ?  For example, most organization
	theory to date makes only qualitative predictions about
	aggregate behaviors of organizations, treating environmental
	constraints and contingencies like point loads at the center
	of mass of the organization.

	How can COD contribute in practical arenas such as business
	process reengineering and redesign ?

	To what extent can organization design be treated as a routine
	design problem, with a well defined space of possibilities and
	explicit evaluation criteria ?

	Are there any important implications of the fact that organizations
	are abstract objects, subject to constraints of a different nature
	from the constraints that physical objects are subject to ?

	How should a DPM for COD differ from DPM's for other applications ?

	What role does creative design play in COD ?

Other questions are: What is the state of the art of Computational
Organization Design (COD) ?  What should the agenda for future
research be ?

The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers from the
fields of AI, Design and Organization theory in order to define and
build a community of researchers active in Computational Organization
Design.  The format of the symposium will be designed with the aim to
support this goal and will include selected presentations and
extensive, but closely moderated, discussions.

Anybody who wishes to participate and make a presentation should
submit an extended abstract (500-1000 words) of the presentation.  The
character of presentations may vary widely and include: complete
results, experimental data, report on work in progress, theoretical
analysis and thoughtful speculations.  Other prospective participants
should submit a statement (approximately 500 words) explaining their
interests and experiences related to COD and what they can contribute
to the discussions.  Please, include references to all your
publications related to COD in all submission.  The number of
participants is limited and invitations will be made based on a review
of the submissions.

Submissions may be included in working notes distributed to the
participants, for discussion purposes only.  No other distribution of
submissions will be made by the organizing committee or AAAI, without
written permission of the authors.

Email submissions are preferred (ASCII or LaTeX), otherwise submit
four hardcopies, or (as a last resort) fax one copy.  Send all
submissions to arrive by October 15 1993, to:
