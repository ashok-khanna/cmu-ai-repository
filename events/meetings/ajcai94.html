                                                Ms.  Gabrielle Aldridge


We invite authors to submit papers describing both experimental and
theoretical results from all stages of AI research.  In particular, we
encourage submission of papers that describe innovative concepts,
techniques, perspectives, or observations that are not yet supported by
mature results. Such submissions must include substantial analysis of the
ideas, the technology needed to realise them, and their potential impact.
Papers describing applied AI are particularly solicited.  In addition,
because of the essential interdisciplinary nature of AI and the need to
maintain effective communication across sub-specialties, we encourage
authors to position and motivate their work in the larger context of the
general AI community.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Machine Learning                            Knowledge Acquisition
Natural Language Processing                 Natural Language Understanding
Hybrid Systems                              Genetic Algorithms
Evolutionary Programming                    Knowledge Based Systems
Knowledge Representation                    Qualitative Reasoning
Automated Reasoning                         Planning and Scheduling
Cognitive Modelling                         Robotics
Vision                                      Distributed Artificial Intelligence
Neural Network                              Image Analysis

Authors are invited to submit complete, original papers in the format
specified below, reflecting their current research results. All submitted
papers will be refereed for quality and originality. The program committee
reserves the right to accept submissions as either technical or poster
presentation paper. Authors must submit five (5) copies of the completed
paper to the AI'94 Conference Secretary at the following address by 15th.
June 1994.

		        The University of New England
		           Armidale, N.S.W., 2351
		                 AUSTRALIA 

All five (5) copies of the submitted paper must be clearly legible. Neither
computer files nor fax submission are acceptable. Papers received after the
15th. June 1994 will be returned unopened. Notification of receipt will be
mailed to the first author (or designated author) soon after receipt. 
 

PAPER FORMAT FOR REVIEW

All five copies of the submissions must be printed on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4
paper using 12 point type (10 characters per inch for typewriters or 12
point LaTeX article-style). Double-sided printing is strongly encouraged.

	    1st Australian Conceptual Structures Workshop

		    in association with the

    Seventh Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI'94)

		    November 22, 1994

	    University of New England, Armidale, New South Wales

THEME

Conceptual graphs are a logic-based formalism for knowledge
representation based on the existential graphs of Charles S. Peirce and
semantic networks.  1994 marks the tenth anniversary of their use.
During this time conceptual structures have been widely used as a
semantic representation for natural language and as a graphic system of
logic for expert systems, theorem provers, and database design.
Significant gains have been made in the storage and retrieval of DBMS
information coupled with knowledge-based system problem solving
capability.

Researchers have developed a sizable software base and continue to
build upon it.  Successful implementations include: rule-based systems,
database systems, knowledge-based systems, knowledge engineering tools,
enterprise modeling, management information systems, conceptual
information retrieval, medical informatics and natural language
applications, among others.

Conceptual graphs are being proposed as a basis for the normative
language for conceptual schemas by the ANSI X3H4 Committee on
Information Resource Dictionary Systems. Conceptual graphs are also
proposed with Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) as the standard for
knowledge interchange between computer systems.

We encourage the submission of position papers concerning
conceptualization, formation and modeling using conceptual graphs.

TOPICS and ISSUES

Papers are invited on any aspect of concept analysis, representation,
or manipulation involving conceptual graphs.  The following topics are
of particular interest but others, concerned with conceptual graphs,
will be welcome as well.

Theory
Technical developments
Applications
Natural language understanding  
Graph notation
Theorem Proving
Ontology

             1st AUSTRALIAN CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES WORKSHOP

                      in association with the

    Seventh Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI'94)

   University of New England, Armidale, N.S.W., Australia, November 22, 1994


THEME

Conceptual graphs are a logic-based formalism for knowledge representation 
based on the existential graphs of Charles S. Peirce and semantic networks.  
1994 marks the tenth anniversary of their use. During this time conceptual 
structures have been widely used as a semantic representation for natural 
language and as a graphic system of logic for expert systems, theorem provers, 
and database design. Significant gains have been made in the storage and 
retrieval of DBMS information coupled with knowledge-based system problem 
solving capability.

Researchers have developed a sizeable software base and continue to build upon 
it.  Successful implementations include: rule-based systems, database systems, 
knowledge-based systems, knowledge engineering tools, enterprise modelling, 
management information systems, conceptual information retrieval, medical 
informatics and natural language applications, among others.

Conceptual graphs are being proposed as a basis for the normative language for 
conceptual schemas by the ANSI X3H4 Committee on Information Resource Dictionary
Systems. Conceptual graphs are also proposed with Knowledge Interchange Format 
(KIF) as the standard for knowledge interchange between computer systems.

We encourage the submission of position papers concerning conceptualisation, 
formation and modelling using conceptual graphs.


TOPICS and ISSUES

Papers are invited on any aspect of concept analysis, representation, or 
manipulation involving conceptual graphs. The following topics are of 
particular interest but others, concerned with conceptual graphs, will be 
welcome as well.

	* Theory
	* Technical developments
	* Applications
	* Natural language understanding  
	* Graph notation
	* Theorem Proving
	* Ontology

              AI'94 WORKSHOP ON EXPERT SYSTEMS IN PRODUCTION USE

    University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia, 22 November 1994


TOPICS AND ISSUES

This workshop focuses on KBS/ES that are already in production use. It is 
envisaged that the workshop provides an opportunity for academic and industry 
specialists to discuss the pragmatics of developing, maintaining and gaining 
organisational acceptance of expert systems. Applications may be running on 
mainframe, workstations or microcomputers. Although all areas of expert systems 
applications are welcome, we are particularly interested in applications from 
the major financial services sectors and defense areas. Typical applications 
may include:

        - investment analysis;
        - loan evaluation;
        - risk analysis;
        - stock forecasting;
        - fraud detection;
        - claims processing;
        - underwriting;
        - help-desk advisory systems;
        - surveillance systems and
        - sonar analysis.

A range of technical and organisational issues is expected to be covered in the 
workshop. Issues may include:

        - choice of hardware and software;
        - data collection and knowledge acquisition;
        - efficiency;
        - cost considerations;
        - project planning and control;
        - human computer interface;
        - user training and acceptance;
        - management support and
        - technical support and maintenance.


FORMAT AND DURATION OF THE WORKSHOP

        - Preceded by a series of short presentations (6-8, 20 minutes each) 
        - 2-3 panel sessions on specific issues
        - Demonstrations
        - Workshop summary


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Attendance is primarily restricted to participants who actually have a system 
or systems in production use although there will be places for "attendance only"
participants who can demonstrate they have a strong interest in and are active 
in the field. Applicants who intend to present should send an extended abstract 
(3-5 pages; around 1000-1500 words). Applicants who seek only to attend should 
forward a one-page concise summary of their current work.

   AI'94 WORKSHOP ON KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS IN NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

   University of New England, Armidale, N.S.W., Australia, November 22, 1994


THEME

Knowledge-based systems have been used with varying degrees of success in 
natural resource management for some time, in areas like agriculture, fisheries,
spatial modelling of landscapes, and forestry. This workshop aims to look at 
what features successful systems do have, at problem areas, and at fruitful 
directions for further development. In addition to applications, the focus will 
be on methods of knowledge acquisition and representation, user and system 
interface,  the integration of different forms of information technology, and  
the possibilities for knowledge sharing with similar systems. Of particular 
interest are papers addressing special difficulties which arise in the 
development of knowledge-based systems in this domain.  

The editor of the International Journal of Applied Expert Systems has agreed
to publish a special issue based on workshop papers. The papers will be
subject to another referring, and four will be selected.

	2nd Australian Workshop on Natural Language Processing

			in association with the

    Seventh Australian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI'94)
             University of New England, Armidale, N.S.W., Australia 
                      22 November 1994 (preceding AI'94)


AIMS

The principal aim is to bring together researchers in Natural
Language Processing and related fields. The workshop is intended
to be a forum for discussing various facets of problems associated
with natural language understanding and generation by machines,
and emerging methodologies for addressing these problems.

Currently those active in these areas of research in Australia have very
few avenues for the discussion and sharing of ideas and points of view.
This workshop builds on the success of the Workshop on Natural Language
Processing associated with AI'93 to address this problem. Hopefully by
bringing together researchers in this field, we can share ideas and learn
from one another, thus encouraging further development and consolidation
of research in Natural Language Processing in Australia.


SCOPE

The primary aim of this workshop is to help engender a sense of 
community amongst Australian and New Zealand-based researchers in NLP; 
to this end, we welcome submissions on any aspect from the full range 
of ongoing work in natural language processing, including but not limited to:

	* computational morphology
	* parsing and parser construction
	* syntactic and semantic interpretation
	* pragmatic and contextual interpretation
	* natural language processing techniques for spoken interaction
	* user modelling
	* text generation/realization for dialogues
	* language translation systems

To help focus the workshop, we intend to allocate a portion of the day
to discussions about one specific theme; given the recent high level of
public interest in the concept of the information superhighway, we would
particularly appreciate submissions which address issues related to NL
access to online services. We therefore ask contributors to look for
connections of their work to this topic. The remainder of the workshop
will be available for broader discussions on a wider range of issues.


PARTICIPATION

Attendance to this one-day workshop will be limited to about 20
active participants selected by the organisers on the basis of their
submissions. Submissions may be either a short description of the
authors' current research, specifying why their contribution to the
workshop would be of interest, or an extended abstract.
Extended abstracts will be reviewed and authors of accepted abstracts
will be given the opportunity to expand their ideas into full papers
which will appear in the proceedings of the workshop.

Depending on the submissions the workshop organisers may schedule
discussion sessions based on issues of common interest.


SUBMISSION

Four hard copies of submissions must be received by August 9, 1993.
Electronic submissions in postscript are also acceptable.
The submissions should take one of the following forms:
	- extended abstracts of papers to be presented at the workshop
	  (about 2000 words)
	- descriptions of current research to justify attendance
	  (about 1000 words), no presentation at the workshop


All submissions should be sent to the following address:
	Ingrid Zukerman
	Department of Computer Science
	Monash University
	Clayton, VICTORIA 3168
	AUSTRALIA


DEADLINES

Submission of extended abstract or research description:   August 9, 1994
Notification of acceptance:   				   September 16, 1994
Full paper submission:        				   October 17, 1994

ABSTRACT

Many topics in AI became fashionable and then disappeared again.
Constraint-based reasoning is certainly an exception to this. Started
in the early seventies with algorithms like the well-known Waltz
algorithm, the interest in constraint-based reasoning has increased
during the successive years, involving researchers from different
areas and with different backgrounds.

Constraint-based reasoning is applied in a variety of applications. To
name a few examples: A project group at the University of Hamburg
recently developed a constraint-based system for planning the cabin
layout of the newest version of the Airbus (which is considered to be
one of the most advanced civil aircrafts currently available).
Researchers from NASA recently published their work on a
constraint-based system for scheduling observations using the Hubble
Space Telescope.  Ascent Technology, Inc., developed the
constraint-based system ARIS (Airport Resource Information System),
which is used by Delta Airlines to help allocate airport gates to
arriving flights.


DETAILED PLAN

This tutorial will give an introduction to the main concepts and
techniques of constraint-based reasoning. It is divided into a lecture
and a practical part. The latter involves some programming using a
toolbox of constraint satisfaction algorithms written in C. The
lecture is structured as follows:

   1. Motivation for the tutorial and a general introduction to
      constraint-based reasoning.

   2. Presentation of a demo domain for constraint-based reasoning:
      reasoning about the spatial relationships among items in a
      typical office.

   3. Introduction of a general framework for constraint-based
      reasoning.

   4. Overspecified constraint satisfaction problems: a real-world
      problem.

   5. General techniques for constraint-based reasoning: from local
      consistency algorithms to backtracking with heuristics.

   6. Constraint-based reasoning on parallel and massively parallel
      computers.

   7. Constraint satisfaction as an optimization problem.

   8. Some applications of constraint-based reasoning.

   9. Summary of the main concepts and conclusion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of structured sequence of tutorials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are couple of structured sequence of tutorials that one could adopt.
For example, if the participant is interested in logic/theoretical basis of
AI, then he/she may want to select the following sequence:

Day 1   9.30 - 10.30: Introdution to AI
       11.00 - 12.30: NMR(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: NMR(t)
        4.00 -  5.30: NMR(p)

Day 2   9.00 - 10.30: CBR(t)    
       11.00 - 12.30: CBR(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: CBR(t) 
        4.00 -  5.30: CBR(p)

Alternatively, if the participant is more interested in the applications of
AI, then the following sequence may be more suitable:

Day 1   9.30 - 10.30: Introdution to AI
       11.00 - 12.30: IDSS(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: IDSS(t)
        4.00 -  5.30: IDSS(p)

Day 2   9.00 - 10.30: FLFC(t)
       11.00 - 12.30: FLFC(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: FLFC(p) 


If the interest is in Machine Learning/Knowledge Acquisition, then the
possible sequence may be:

Day 1   9.30 - 10.30: Introdution to AI 
       11.00 - 12.30: TFML(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: TFML(t)
        4.00 -  5.30: TFML(t)

Day 2   9.00 - 10.30: ILDB(t)  or  KAM(t)    
       11.00 - 12.30: ILDB(t)  or  KAM(t)
        2.00 -  3.30: ILDB(p)  or  KAM(d)

Another possible sequence may be:

Day 1   9.30 - 10.30: Introdution to AI

INTRODUCTION

Evolutionary computation is the study of computational systems which use ideas 
and get inspirations from natural evolution.  This full-day tutorial will give 
a practical introduction to genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming and 
evolution strategies and present a brief overview of the whole field of 
evolutionary computation.


OUTLINE OF THE TUTORIAL

This tutorial will concentrate on evolutionary optimisation although 
evolutionary learning will also be covered.  It consists of three sessions.  
One of them is allocated for practical experiments in which the participants 
will have an opportunity to go through some examples and get a better idea of 
how evolutionary optimisation works in practice.  The tutorial is mainly 
designed for newcomers to the field of evolutionary computation.  The topics 
covered by the tutorial include the following:

1.  Introduction

OVERVIEW

Fuzzy logic, along with artificial neural networks and genetic
algorithms constitutes a part of computational intelligence which, in
recent years, has become a focal point of research. It attempts to
model and mathematically encapsulate the approximate reasoning
processes under the influence of imprecise, incomplete and vague input
data. Fuzzy logic has strengths in modelling highly nonlinear,
complex sytems which are commonly  encountered in product design,
manufacturing and control.

One application of fuzzy logic, control systems utilizing some of its
concepts has become an important engineering tool. This tutorial
presents a comprehensive picture of fundamental issues of fuzzy logic
in order to study the structure and operation of fuzzy logic
controllers.


DETAILED PLAN

The tutorial will address these issues:

        * introduction and approaches to system modeling: comparison
	  of explicit, neural and fuzzy modeling methods,

	* crisp sets and fuzzy sets, basic concepts,

	* operations on fuzzy sets, t-norms and t-conorms,

	* fuzzy relations and composition of fuzzy relations,

	* fuzzy inference, generalized modus ponens, generalized modus 
	  tollens, fuzzy implication functions,

	* a brief look at intelligent control, 

	* fuzzy logic controllers: operation and examples.

Towards the end of the tutorial, a laboratory session is organized. In the 
laboratory session, participants will be able to test their ideas by writing 
their fuzzy rule bases for a simulated fuzzy logic controller in the  UNIX 
environment.


BIO-DATA OF THE PRESENTER

studies he has worked as a research assistant at the Biomedical
Engineering laboratory of Middle East Technical University.  Later, he
has held research and development engineering positions at Aselsan and
Ericsson.  Currently he is working towards his Ph.D. degree in the
domain of Adaptive Fuzzy Systems.

Professor Gregory K. Egan is director of Laboratory for Concurrent
Computing Systems, Swinburne University of Technology and principal
lecturer at the School of Electrical Engineering. He has graduated in
Communication Engineering from RMIT in 1975. He has been awarded an
M.Sc. degree in computational methods in 1976, and, a Ph.D. in
parallel computer architectures in 1979 both at the Victoria
University of Manchester. From 1980 onwards he developed and led the
computer systems engineering groups and developed teaching programs at
RMIT and Swinburne University of Technology.


PREREQUISITES
 
This tutorial will present both introductory and in-depth material.
So, it will be suitable for both to novices, as well as to those with
some background who wish to extend their knowledge in the area of
fuzzy logic controllers. No prerequisite knowledge of the field is
necessary. However, some background in propositional logic and
classical set theory would be helpful.

ABSTRACT

The current development of knowledge engineering brings to use very powerful 
methods for representing and dealing with raw data, incomplete or imprecise 
data and knowledge, uncertainty, common sense knowledge, complex systems. And 
these are the connectionist methods, the methods of fuzzy logic and the chaos 
theory, which complement the existing AI symbolic methods. What are the main 
principles of the symbolic AI methods, the connectionist methods, the methods 
of fuzzy systems and chaos theory and how can one use if necessary, all of them 
when creating an information system? This is the main theme of the tutorial. 

First, the main principles of using symbolic, fuzzy and neuro systems for 
problem solving will be discussed and compared. Then hybrid systems will be 
introduced. A hybrid symbolic-fuzzy-neural environment will be used for 
demonstration and practical examples will be given as illustrations. Different 
techniques for solving difficult problems in a hybrid environment will be 
demonstrated.  Connectionist and fuzzy systems can compliment each other very 
well. How to use neural networks for learning fuzzy rules and how to implement 
fuzzy rules in a connectionist structure will also be discussed. A picture on 
the current development of fuzzy neurons and fuzzy neural networks will be 
given. 

Another topic presented in the tutorial is chaos theory. Chaos theory has 
tremendous potential in many areas. It is not only about the infinite variety 
of `patterns' which can be generated by using a chaotic function with a lot of 
practical applications, but it is also the way we can simulate or approximate 
complex real systems. Chaotic neurons and chaotic neural networks will be 
presented with some of their applications. 

Having different techniques implemented in one hybrid environment facilitates 
creating more powerful information processing systems than any of its 
components. So, the main advantage of using hybrid systems is that they have 
all the advantages of their subsystems which make them very powerful tools 
especially for solving AI problems.

ABSTRACT

This tutorial will demonstrate how attendees can move beyond using rule 
based reasoning to build intelligent decision support systems.  In this 
tutorial we focus upon supplementing deductive reasoning with case based 
reasoning, neural networks and intelligent information retrieval.  Applications 
of these principles in law, management and finance will be provided.

The tutorial will provide background knowledge necessary to understand the 
lectures of Professor Sowa and Sycara.


OUTLINE OF THE TUTORIAL

*	Introduction 
	- The need for intelligent decision support systems in finance, 
          management and law

*	Strategies for providing Intelligent Decision Support Systems 
        - Intelligent Information Retrieval, Deductive Reasoning, Case Based 
          Reasoning

* 	Intelligent Information Retrieval 
        - Keyword retrieval, Boolean retrieval, Vector space models,
          Probabilistic models.

*	Introduction to deductive reasoning systems 
	- Production rule systems, Logic programming approaches,
          Object oriented approaches.

*	Case based reasoning systems 
	- What are based reasoners? Why use case based reasoners? 
	  Constructing differing types of case based reasoners. Examples of 
          case based reasoners: MEDIATOR, PERSUADER, CASEY, HYPO, PROTOS 
          Automated design of case bases.

*	Integrating deductive and case based reasoning 
	- Using the object oriented approach to build integrated systems. 
	  The relative benefits and disadvantages of blackboard systems and 
	  distributed artificial intelligence to build integrated systems. 
	  Examples of integrated systems: ANAPRON, CABARET, GREBE, IKBALS, 
          PROLEXS

*	Combining information retrieval, deductive reasoning, neural networks 
	and case based reasoning 
	- Conceptual information retrieval and neural networks, Bayesian 
          Inference Networks, hypertext, The DATALEX workstation, AIR and 
          SCALIR, WIN (Westlaw Is Natural), SPLIT UP.

*	Conclusion


ASSOCIATED PRACTICAL WORK

There will be two practical components in the tutorial

     Participants will have the opportunity to examine and use integrated
     systems built by the tutorial presenters: in particular IKBALS and
     FLORENCE -- integrated rule based/case based reasoners -- and SPLIT-UP
     an integrated rule based/neural network system.

     Participants will build legal knowledge based systems under the 
     guidance of the tutorial presenters. They will have the opportunity to
     examine how to supplement rule based reasoning with one or more of the 
     reasoning and retrieval approaches discussed in the tutorial.

ABSTRACT

Knowledge acquisition from databases is a research frontier for both database
technology and machine learning (ML) techniques, and has seen sustained
research over recent years.  It also acts as a link between the two fields,
thus offering a dual benefit.  Firstly, since database technology has already
found wide application in many fields, ML research obviously stands to gain
from this greater exposure and established technological foundation. Secondly,
ML techniques can augment the ability of existing database systems to
represent, acquire, and process a collection of expertise such as those which
form part of the semantics of many advanced applications (e.g. CAD/CAM). This
full-day tutorial will present and discuss techniques for the following 3
interconnected phases in constructing intelligent learning database systems:
(1) Translation of standard database information into a form suitable for use
by a rule-based system; (2) Using machine learning techniques to produce rule
bases from databases; and (3) Interpreting the rules produced to solve users'
problems and/or reduce data spaces.  It will suit a wide audience (including
postgraduate students and industrial people) from databases, expert systems,
and machine learning.

 AI'94 Tutorial on Knowledge Acquisition and Maintenance with Ripple Down Rules

GOALS

The aim of this tutorial is to teach participants a simple but powerful
knowledge acquisition (KA) technique for building knowledge based systems
(KBS), Ripple Down Rules (RDR).  

The problems in KA arise partly because of our naive cultural expectations
as to what an expert is capable of providing.  The tutorial will encourage
participants to a critical view as to what knowledge acquisition is about
and provide a standpoint for understanding and evaluating KA solutions
proposed by current research.  

RDR will be proposed as a partial solution to the KA problem.  It is
intended that the tutorial will leave participants with a sufficiently
detailed understanding of RDR, its strengths and limitations, so that
without further KBS background they will be able apply RDR to building KBS.

It is intended that,  assuming reasonable programming skills, participants
will be able to build their own RDR interpreters, adapt existing expert
system shells to use RDR, or extend existing information systems to include
RDR, if desired.  It will be possible to present the algorithms involved in
sufficient detail for this because of their simplicity.  However, no prior
experience will be assumed and participants will be provided with RDR
software sufficient to build reasonably large systems.

Finally it would be hoped that participants would get a clear idea of the
limitations of RDR and perhaps be encouraged to explore solutions to these
problems.


BACKGROUND

The first major problem in the successful development of a KBS is the
choice of an application.  Assuming the application is suitable, to build a
significant KBS requires considerable effort, particularly in acquiring and
maintaining the expert knowledge needed by the system.   This has been
described as the "knowledge engineering bottleneck".  The essential problem
in KA is that experts never explain how they reach a conclusion, rather
they justify that their conclusion is correct.  This justification depends
on the context in which it is given, whether the person for whom the
justification is intended is a lay person, a trainee and expert etc.  That
is, knowledge is always "situated" in a context.  Further, it is not part
of an expert's normal skill to be able tocategorise and describe the type
of problem solving they carry out.  

Most current research aims at setting up methodologies to approach these
problems in a disciplined and careful way.  Such methods, in common with
conventional software engineering techniques, are powerful, interesting,
have wide applicability, but require sophisticated practitioners.   Ripple
Down Rules is knowledge acquisition methodology which assumes that since
knowledge is given only in a specific context it should be used only in the
same context.  This leads to an approach to building KBS by incremental
refinement covering maintenance as well as initial development.  It also
allows the knowledge being added to be easily validated.  This approach has
a number of consequences.  

Firstly, RDR allow experts to build KBS without any knowledge engineering
or programming assistance or training.  This has been demonstrated in the
PEIRS system at St.Vincent's Hospital Sydney.  This systems provides
interpretative comments for diagnostic pathology laboratory reports.  It
currently has over 2000 rules and is 95% correct in the domains it covers.
It would seem to be one of the largest medical systems in actual routine
use.  It also seems to be the only large system in use built without a
knowledge engineer (or without induction).  Importantly it was put into
routine use with only 200 rules and all other knowledge has been added
while the system has been in use as a minor extension to  the expert's
normal duties.

Secondly, RDR blur the distinction between maintenance and initial
development.  The cost of adding a rule with an RDR system is the same
regardless of how large the system is and how long it has been under
development.  The issue of loss of expertise and the difficulty of dealing
with a large structure built by someone else does not arise in the
incremental approach used with RDR.  

Thirdly RDR seem to be the first practical approach to KBS based on a
situated cognition perspective.  Situated cognition is increasingly the
basis of a critique of traditional  approaches to AI.  RDR eschew the
notion that it is necessary to search for the best or right way of
constructing a KB.  Rather knowledge is constructed in context as a
consequence of applying insight to a concrete problem.  RDR thus emphasise
test and repair rather than problem solving and domain analyss.

RDR do not immediately solve all problems and have their own intrinsic
problems.  The most important problem is that the KB may contain repeated
knowledge acquired through repeated KA of the same knowledge.   Brian
Gaines (University of Calgary) has developed an inductive method of
building or compressing an RDR KB which will be described in detail. 
However it has also been shown that this is minor rather than major problem
(PEIRS has not yet been compressed).  Secondly, RDR were developed for
applications where a single classification is required and all the data are
available before inference. Extensions to RDR to deal with multiple
classifications and problems such as configuration will be described. 
Participants should expect to gain some insight into how these problems can
be dealt with, but the major focus of the tutorial will be on standard
single classification RDR.  Finally, the development of  domain models and
suitable data abstraction for RDR will be discussed.

TUTORIAL MATERIALS

Participants will be provided with notes and/or copies of key papers on RDR
and a demonstration program for Apple Macintosh or Windows on a PC.  The
demonstration programs are stand alone and will enable participants to
build significant RDR systems.  Their best use however will be as a
demonstration program as RDR are best used embedded within an information
system.  The software will be demonstrated during the tutorial.  It is not
necessary for participants to bring a portable Macintosh or PC to the
tutorial, but it will facilitate participation.

ABSTRACT

Complete information is difficult to come by and generally not available
even in simple database applications. Consequently, an intelligent
reasoning system must be capable of making plausible conjectures, which
may be retracted when found to be incorrect according to new information
that becomes available. Nonmonotonic Reasoning provides a mechanism for an
intelligent reasoning system to make such conjectures when its knowledge
is incomplete;  this is accomplished by sanctioning inferences by default
or by determining those that are most likely according to some criteria. 

The tutorial will consist of a theoretical and a practical component.  In
the theoretical component we aim to provide a conceptual framework for
Nonmonotonic Reasoning. Rather than discussing a very broad set of topics,
we will focus on one of the main approaches to Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
namely default logic.  In particular, we will focus on how one can
represent problems and how one may determine extensions within the default
logic formalism.  In practice, determining extensions is one of the main
obstacles when implementing and applying default logic, and is very often
neglected in tutorials, courses, and even books.  The practical component
comprises the hands-on development of an example whose purpose is to
illustrate the utility of Nonmonotonic Reasoning. 

Participants will obtain an appreciation of some methods in the field of
Nonmonotonic Reasoning, and will also explore tools and techniques which
are very useful in practice.

ABSTRACT

The act of learning is one of the most important hallmarks of what 
it means to  be intelligent  and  most AI  systems  are  far from  
exhibiting this property. Realization of this deficiency in expert 
systems  has  caused learning  to become  a central  issue  in AI  
today.   Herbert Simon, in his  keynote  address  at last year's
AAAI, noted that Machine Learning will increasingly  take  center
stage  in  AI throughout the next decade.  Most future AI systems
will need some ability to learn and to adapt to changes in  their
environments unforeseen by the system developers.

Machine Learning certainly is one of the hardest problems  in  AI
today.  Despite considerable progress, it can be argued that some
approaches to Machine Learning are  still  practiced  as  ``black
art.''   Sometimes  a  learning  algorithm  achieves  astonishing
results; and yet at other times they perform so poorly  that  the
user  ends  up  tinkering  with the system without any reasonable
return for their effort.

Fundamental investigations into the problems  and  challenges  of
Machine  Learning have been conducted in Philosophy for ages, and
more recently such studies have also been conducted  in  Computer
Science.

GOALS OF THE TUTORIAL

1. To clearly  lay down the central conceptual ingredients  of  a
learning   framework.    These   ingredients   are   not  clearly
distinguished in many practical approaches.  

2. An introduction to the mathematical analysis of learning  tasks  
and  the  basic techniques  of  Computational  Learning  Theory.   

3. The  interplay between  learning  algorithm,  training  data, 
computing time and success criteria will be explored.

DETAILED PLAN 
1. Computational Limitations on Learning         
   1.1 Learnability from  positive  data.          
   1.2 Learnability from positive and negative data.          
   1.3 Batch and Incremental  Learning.   
2. Heuristics   for   Learning
