Whether you're a user or implementor of Common Lisp, Scheme, Dylan, or
EMACS Lisp--or just an interested party--this conference is for you.  It's
a chance to find out what's been going on and to influence what happens
next in the Lisp community.  You'll hear what users and vendors have been
up to, and what they're planning in the future.  You'll participate in the
interactive dialog between the users and vendors about the needs of the
Lisp community in the years ahead.  It's a valuable opportunity to do more
than just program in Lisp--it's a chance to be a part of the Lisp
community, to learn, and to contribute to a strong future.

The keynote addresses will be:

  ``Lisp as an Extension Language'' 
      by Richard Stallman, Free Software Foundation

  ``Perspectives on Lisp''
      by John McCarthy, Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University

The agenda also features other interesting talks, panels, and paper 
presentations.  See the attached schedule of events.

The conference will be held at the Berkeley Marina Marriott hotel.  We are
pleased to announce that this years sleeping room rate is $89.00
(single/double).  There is complimentary parking at the hotel.  Either the
Oakland or San Francisco airport may be used; Oakland is suggested for
domestic flights.

Registration pricing remains unchanged from last year:  Monday and Tuesday
will be half-day tutorials at the rate of $125 per tutorial.  The main
conference (Wednesday through Friday) will be $400.  Very substantial
discounts are available for full-time students.

    Prerequisite:  CLIM level I and/or a good understanding of CLIM,
		   CLOS and Lisp.

12. Comparing and Contrasting Common Lisp, Scheme, and Dylan

    An overview of these three languages, with emphasis on where they
    overlap and how they differ, for programmers who need to move back
    and forth between them.

           The Association of Lisp Users invites you to attend
                                 LUV '94
                         The Fourth International
                    Lisp Users and Vendors Conference
                              to be held in
                           Berkeley, California
                                    on
                            August 15-19, 1994
              Please mark your calendar and plan to join us!

Whether you're a user or implementor of Common Lisp, Scheme, Dylan, or
EMACS Lisp--or just an interested party--this conference is for you.  It's
a chance to find out what's been going on and to influence what happens
next in the Lisp community.  You'll hear what users and vendors have been
up to, and what they're planning in the future.  You'll participate in the
interactive dialog between the users and vendors about the needs of the
Lisp community in the years ahead.  It's a valuable opportunity to do more
than just program in Lisp--it's a chance to be a part of the Lisp
community, to learn, and to contribute to a strong future.

The keynote addresses will be:

  ``Lisp as an Extension Language'' 
      by Richard Stallman, Free Software Foundation

  ``Perspectives on Lisp''
      by John McCarthy, Professor of Computer Science, Stanford University

The agenda also features other interesting talks, panels, and paper 
presentations.  See the attached schedule of events.

The conference will be held at the Berkeley Marina Marriott hotel.  We are
pleased to announce that this years sleeping room rate is $89.00
(single/double).  There is complimentary parking at the hotel.  Either the
Oakland or San Francisco airport may be used; Oakland is suggested for
domestic flights.

Registration pricing remains unchanged from last year:  Monday and Tuesday
will be half-day tutorials at the rate of $125 per tutorial.  The main
conference (Wednesday through Friday) will be $400.  Very substantial
discounts are available for full-time students.
