Timetable

Submissions must be received by 6th January 1995. Submissions received  after
that date will be returned unopened.  Authors should note that ordinary  mail
can sometimes be considerably delayed,  especially over the new year  period,
and should take this into account when timing their submissions. Notification
of receipt will  be mailed to  the first author  (or designated author)  soon
after receipt.

Notification of acceptance or rejection: successful authors will be  notified
on or before 20th March 1995.  Unsuccessful authors will be notified by  27th
March 1995. Notification  will be  sent to  the first  author (or  designated
author).

Camera ready copies of the final versions of accepted papers must be received
by the publisher in the USA by 24th April 1995.

Note that at least one  author of each accepted  paper is required to  attend
the conference to present the work.

General

Authors should submit six (6) copies of  their papers in hard copy form.  All
paper submissions  should be  to  the following  address. Electronic  or  fax
submissions cannot be accepted.

IJCAI-95 Paper Submissions,
American Association for Artificial Intelligence,
445, Burgess Drive,
Menlo Park, CA. 94025, USA.

(telephone (415) 328-3123, email ijcai@aaai.org).

Appearance and Length

Papers should be printed on  8.5'' x 11'' or A4  sized paper. They must  be a
maximum of 15 pages long, each page having no more than 43 lines, lines being
at most  140mm long  and with  12 point  type. Title,  abstract, figures  and
references must be included within  this length limit. Papers breaking  these
rules will not be considered for presentation at the conference.

Letter quality  print is  required. (Normally,  dot-matrix printout  will  be
unacceptable unless  truly of  letter quality.  Exceptions will  be made  for
submissions from  countries  where  high  quality  printers  are  not  widely
available.)

Title Page

Each copy of the paper must include  a title page, separate from the body  of
the paper. This should contain:

* Title of the paper
* Full names, postal addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email
  addresses (where these exist) of all authors. The first postal address
  should be one that is suitable for delivery of items by courier service
* An abstract of 100-200 words
* A set of keywords giving the area/subarea of the paper and describing the
  topic of the paper. This information, together with the title of the paper,
  will be the main information used in allocating reviewers.
* The following declaration:
   ``This paper has not already been accepted by and is not currently under
     review for a journal or another conference. Nor will it be submitted
     for such during IJCAI's review period.''

Policy on Multiple Submissions

IJCAI will not accept any  paper which, at the  time of submission, is  under
review for a journal or another conference. Authors are also expected not  to
submit  their   papers  elsewhere   during  IJCAI's   review  period.   These
restrictions apply only  to journals  and conferences, not  to workshops  and
similar specialized presentations with a limited audience.

Review Criteria

Papers will be subject to peer review, but this review will not be  ``blind''
(that is, the reviewers will be aware of the names of the authors). Selection
criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and  significance
of results and the quality of  the presentation. The decision of the  Program
Committee, taking into  consideration the individual  reviews, will be  final
and cannot be appealed.  Papers selected will  be scheduled for  presentation
and will be printed in the proceedings. Authors of accepted papers, or  their
representatives, are expected to present their papers at the conference.

Distinguished Paper Awards

The Program  Committee will  distinguish one  or more  papers of  exceptional
quality for special awards.  This decision will in  no way depend on  whether
the authors choose to enhance their paper with a video presentation.

Other Calls

Calls for  tutorial  and  workshop  proposals  and  video  presentations  for
IJCAI-95 will be issued shortly.

Included below are the IJCAI-95 Panel, Tutorial, Workshop and Video Calls.
Please feel free to remail to other interested parties in the AI Community.

=========================================================================

CALL FOR PANEL PROPOSALS: IJCAI-95

The IJCAI-95 Program Committee invites proposals for the Panel Program for
IJCAI-95, which is to be held in Montreal, Canada, August 20-25, 1995.

A panel allows three to five people to present their distinct views on an
issue or question of general interest.

Panels should be both relevant and interesting to the AI community, and have a
clearly specified issue that is narrow enough to be addressed in a single
session of one hour (though longer sessions could be negotiated). Panelists
must have substantial experience with the topic.

A panel presents focused questions that stimulate audience discussion.
It focuses on alternative approaches to, or views on, a common question,
where panelists present their ideas. The question must be such that there are
significantly opposing views expressed by the members of the panel.

Panels are usually organized as follows: the chairperson starts the panel by
introducing the topic and by providing appropriate background material; next,
the panelists provide short presentations, followed by an exchange between the
panelists and the audience; the chairperson ends the panel with a summary
statement.

The discussion with the audience must take precedence.  Panel chairs should
plan on at least one-third of the total time to be spent on this.

Requirements for Submission

Panel proposals will only be accepted if it is very clear that the panel will
allow for the expression of widely diverging positions on an issue
of concern to a wide section of the AI community. Because of this very
strong requirement, it is likely that only a small number of proposals
will be accepted.

A panel proposal consists of a cover page, an overall summary, a
summary of each member's presentation, and letters from the panelists
confirming their intent to participate.

The cover page should contain:
Title of the panel
Name, postal address, phone number and email address of the proposed
chairperson
Names, postal addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of the
proposed panelists.

The overall summary should be about 500 words in length, giving a clear
description of the topic of the panel in a manner that general members of the
AI community can understand and appreciate.  It should indicate how the
member's presentations will present a range of different approaches to the
common issue. In addition, the summary should address the following questions:

What is the relevance or significance of the panel at this time?
Everyone's research area is important, but why is a panel particularly useful
now, on this topic, and in the IJCAI-95 context?
What is the general AI interest in the topic?  Please give evidence, such
as recent important papers, workshops, etc.
How does the panel membership demonstrate broad coverage of the topic,
or, if this is not the case, why is narrow coverage preferable?
If your topic has been discussed by another panel at a recent national or
international AI conference, how will your panel differ from it?

The final part of a proposal consists of brief summaries of each
member's presentation, including the chairperson's presentation, if there is
one. Each summary should give a clear description of the member's view or
approach and demonstrate connections to the panel topic.  Each member's 
summary should be approximately 500 words in length.

The entire proposal should make it clear that all the participants are
addressing a common issue, but from very different viewpoints.

Panel proposals should be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than 
November 1st 1994.  Proposals will be reviewed as soon as they are received. 
Proposals may be accepted as they stand or revision and re-review may be 
required.

Chairpersons for accepted proposals will be responsible for:

Preparation of a description of the panel for publication in the
conference proceedings (Normally, this will be an extended version of the
complete proposal.)
Determining the format of the panel session and ensuring that it runs
according to schedule
Ensuring that the presentations of the panelists adequately address the
panel's topic.

Submit proposals and enquiries to:

===========================================================================


CALL FOR TUTORIAL PROPOSALS: IJCAI-95

The IJCAI-95 Program Committee invites proposals for the Tutorial Program for
IJCAI-95, which is to be held in Montreal, Canada, August 20-25, 1995.

Tutorials will be offered both on standard topics and on new and more advanced
topics.  A list of suggested topics that can be covered by tutorials is given
below, but this list is only a guide.  Other topics, both related to these and
quite different from them, will be considered:

Analogical and Inductive Inference
Logics for AI and Inference Techniques 
Architectures for AI Systems
Machine Learning 
AI in Education 
Mobile Robot Navigation
AI in Engineering Design
Motion Planning in Robotics
Computer Vision 
Natural Language Programming 
Distributed AI
Neural Networks -- Principles and Applications 
Epistemic Logic in AI
Object-Oriented Knowledge Representation
Hybrid Reasoning
Planning and Reasoning about Time
Innovative Applications of AI
Probabilistic Reasoning and Uncertainty
Knowledge Acquisition -- Theory and Practice
Programming and Reasoning with Constraints
Intelligent Environments to Support Human Learning


Requirements for Submission

Anyone interested in presenting a tutorial should submit a proposal to the
IJCAI-95 Tutorial Chair, Gordon McCalla.  A tutorial proposal should contain
the following information:

A brief description of the tutorial, suitable for inclusion in the
conference registration brochure
A detailed outline of the tutorial
The necessary background and the potential target audience for the
tutorial
A description of why the tutorial topic is of interest to a substantial
part of the IJCAI audience
A brief resume of the presenter(s), which should include name, postal
address, phone and fax numbers, email address if available, background in the
tutorial area, any available example of work in the area (ideally, a published
tutorial-level article on the subject), evidence of teaching experience
(including references that address the proposer's presentation ability), and
evidence of scholarship in AI/Computer Science (equivalent to a published IJCAI
conference paper or tutorial syllabus).


Those submitting a proposal should keep in mind that tutorials are intended to
provide an overview of the field; they should present reasonably well agreed
upon information in a balanced way.  Tutorials should not be used to advocate a
single avenue of research, nor should they promote a product.  It is planned
that the Tutorial Program will consist of about sixteen four-hour tutorials 
given at the beginning of the conference.

Proposals must be received by November 1, 1994.  Decisions about topics and
speakers will be made by December 15, 1994.
Tutors will be sent a set of guidelines for the preparation of course materials.
Completed course materials must be received for duplication by the AAAI office 
by April 28, 1995. Please note that IJCAI will normally only duplicate up to 
200 pages per participant.

Proposals should be sent to:

Gordon McCalla 
Department of Computational Science 
University of Saskatchewan 
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 0W0 
CANADA

==============================================================================


CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS: IJCAI-95

The IJCAI-95 Program Committee invites proposals for the Workshop Program for
IJCAI-95, which is to be held in Montreal, Canada, August 1995.
The workshops for IJCAI-95 will be held in the period 19th - 21st August,
immediately prior to the start of the main conference.

Gathering in an informal setting, workshop participants will have the
opportunity to meet and discuss selected technical topics in an atmosphere
which fosters the active exchange of ideas among researchers and practitioners.
Members from all segments of the AI community are invited to submit proposals
for review.

To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the workshops will be
kept small, preferably under 30 participants and certainly under 40.
Attendance should be limited to active participants only. Workshops are 
intended to be genuinely interactive events and not mini-conferences. Thus, 
although the format of workshop presentations will be determined by the 
organizers proposing the workshop, ample time must be allotted for general 
discussion.  Workshops can vary in length, but most will last a full day.
Attendees at workshops will be required to register for the main IJCAI 
conference.

Proposals for workshops should be between
two and three pages in length, and should contain:

A brief but technical description of the workshop identifying specific 
technical issues that will be its focus.
A discussion of why the workshop is of interest at this time.
The names, postal addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of the
Organizing Committee, which should consist of three or four people
knowledgeable in the field but not all at the same institution.
The name of one member of the Organizing Committee who is designated the 
primary contact, this being someone with an email address.
A list of previously-organized related workshops organized by any of the 
Organizing Committee. This is to help the Workshop Chair put the workshop in
context (previous experience with similar workshops is not required).
If possible, a list of tentatively confirmed attendees.
A proposed schedule for organizing the workshop and a preliminary agenda.
A description of how the organizers intend to encourage a workshop,
rather than a mini-conference, atmosphere.

Proposers are encouraged to send their draft proposal to potential 
participants for comments before submission.

Proposals should be submitted by electronic mail, in plain ASCII text
as soon as possible, but no later than November 1, 1994. Organizers will 
be notified of the committee's decision no later than December 1, 1994. 
Submitters can request an early decision on their proposals, though in such 
cases the standards applied will necessarily be raised.

A summary of accepted workshops with contact addresses will be
available by anonymous FTP from agora.leeds.ac.uk, directory
scs/IJCAI95, after 15th December 1994.
Alternatively, send a blank email message to:
ijcai-95-ws@scs.leeds.ac.uk

Workshop organizers will be responsible for:

Producing and distributing a Call for Participation in the workshop,
open to all members of the AI community. The Call for Participation should 
make it clear that all workshop participants are expected to register
for the main IJCAI conference and that the number of participants is limited.
It should also make clear the process by which the Organizing Committee will
select the participants.
Reviewing requests to participate in the workshop and selecting the
participants.
By December 1, 1995, preparing a review of the workshop for
possible publication and sending it to the workshop chair.
 
Workshop organizers will be sent a set of guidelines for the preparation of 
any working notes. They must provide the AAAI office with the following 
materials by April 7, 1995:

A provisional list of workshop participants.
Any working notes to be duplicated for the workshop, up to a total of
200 pages per participant.
A list of audio-visual requirements and any special room requirements.

Workshop organizers must provide the AAAI office with the following materials
by August 1, 1995:

A final list of workshop participants.


IJCAI will be responsible for:

Providing logistical support and a meeting place for the workshop.
In conjunction with the organizers, determining the workshop date and time.
Duplicating working notes as described above and distributing them to
the participants.

IJCAI encourages the production of publications based on the workshops, but 
the IJCAI name cannot be used on such publications without prior permission 
being given. IJCAI reserves the right to cancel any workshop if deadlines are 
missed.

To cover costs, it will be necessary to charge a fee of US$50 for each
participant for each workshop in addition to the normal IJCAI-95 conference
registration fee.

Please submit your proposals and any inquiries to:

	      IJCAI-95  Video  Track :  Call  For  Videos
	      -------------------------------------------

As a medium, videotapes are better suited than written papers to illuminate 
the efficacy of AI research, especially in the emerging and exciting areas 
of AI in Education, Art, Music, Entertainment, Hypermedia, 3-D Animation,
Artificial Life, Network-Based tools like Mosaic, etc.

If a picture is worth thousand words, then a (3-D) movie will certainly 
enhance the illustration of behaviors of these systems that are based on 
AI principles, methods, and tools.

Recognizing this potential of video presentations to demonstrate and augment 
AI research results, a Video Track has been designated since IJCAI-89 to be 
an integral part of the Technical Programs of IJCAI Conferences.

The Video Track is designed to demonstrate the current levels of
usefulness of AI tools, techniques, and methods for a variety of 
practical and theoretical problems arising in industrial, commercial,
government, space, and educational areas.

You are invited and strongly encouraged to submit to this video track and 
take advantage of the following opportunities and benefits that we intend 
to provide as a forum to showcase your best AI research results.

  + Special video sessions will be organised and timetabled as part of 
    the conference, giving authors an opportunity to present and briefly 
    discuss their videos.
  + Abstracts of accepted videos will appear in the conference proceedings.
  + The entire video program will be published by IJCAI Inc. and will be 
    available for sale after the conference.
  + Apart from the scheduled video sessions where the authors will 
    participate in the presentations, we also plan to make the video 
    program widely viewable by the conference attendees by designating 
    certain time periods during which the videos will run unattended.

Additional details are provided below on:
  + Submission Requirements and Guidelines;
  + Review Criteria;
  + Publication;
  + Important Dates, and
  + Contact Information.

We look forward to your submissions that will contribute to the success
of the IJCAI-95 Video Track.

Submission Requirements and Guidelines
--------------------------------------

Authors are invited to submit THREE (3) copies of a videotape of 15 minutes 
maximum duration, accompanied by a submission letter that includes:

  + Title
  + Full names, postal addresses, phone numbers and email addresses 
    of all authors
  + Subject matter area (e.g. knowledge acquisition, learning, vision,...)
  + Tape format: indicate one of PAL, SECAM, or NTSC(preferred);
    VHS is preferred but .75'' U-matic tapes will be accepted
  + Duration of tape in minutes
  + THREE (3) copies of an abstract of one to two pages in length, 
    containing the title of the video, and full names and addresses 
    of the authors
  + Author's permission to copy tape for review purposes.

All tapes, along with their abstracts, must be submitted by January 6, 1995
to the Videotape Track Chair.  Submissions received after that date will be 
returned unopened. Authors should note that ordinary mail can sometimes be 
considerably delayed and should take this into account when timing their 
submissions.

  + Notification of receipt will be mailed to the first or designated 
    author soon after receipt.
  + All inquiries regarding lost submissions must be made by Feb. 7, 1995.
  + Tapes cannot be returned; 
    authors should retain extra copies for making revisions.
  + Notification of acceptance or rejection will be mailed on or before 
    March 5, 1995 to the first or designated author. 
  + Authors will also have the opportunity to submit a revised version of 
    their videotape about one month following notification of acceptance. 
    Revised tapes must not be more than fifteen (15) minutes duration, 
    must be in NTSC-VHS (U.S. Standard only) format, and must be submitted 
    to the Video Track Chair.
  + Accepted tapes will be sent directly from the Video Track Chair to the 
    conference publisher.

Review Criteria
---------------

Each tape will be rigorously reviewed by experts in the subject matter 
areas of the tape and only the best tapes will be selected for presentation 
at the conference. The following general criteria will guide the selection:

  + Significance and originality of system functionality presented; 
  + The need for and the contribution of the AI component of the system;
  + Clarity of presentation of system's goals, methods, and results;
  + Quality of Presentation (including audio, video, and pace). 
  + Level of interest to the conference audience;

Preference will be given to systems that show a high level of maturity. 
Tapes that are deemed to be advertising commercial products, propaganda, 
purely expository materials, merely taped lectures, or material not of
scientific or technical value will be rejected.

Publication
-----------

Abstracts of accepted videos will be allotted a maximum of two pages each 
in the conference proceedings. The style of these two-page papers should
be the same as the full length papers in the Proceedings, with an initial
abstract of approximately 50 words.

The final version of the video's abstract, edited in the format specified 
in the acceptance letter, must be received by the publishers in the USA 
by April 24, 1995. Authors  will be required to transfer copyright of 
their abstract (but not the video) to IJCAI Inc.

In addition, a 30-minute presentation slot will be made available as part 
of one of the video sessions. To ensure a consistent format to the sessions 
and an opportunity for questions, authors should keep as close as possible 
to the following format for their presentations:

  + 3 minutes introductory presentation
  + 10-13 minutes (average) video showing
  + 7-10 minutes technical details
  + 2 minutes conclusions
  + 5 minutes question period

In addition to showing the accepted tapes at the conference, copies of
them will be available at a nominal cost after the conference.

Timetable

Submissions must be received by 6th January 1995. Submissions received  after
that date will be returned unopened.  Authors should note that ordinary  mail
can sometimes be considerably delayed,  especially over the new year  period,
and should take this into account when timing their submissions. Notification
of receipt will  be mailed to  the first author  (or designated author)  soon
after receipt.

Notification of acceptance or rejection: successful authors will be  notified
on or before 20th March 1995.  Unsuccessful authors will be notified by  27th
March 1995. Notification  will be  sent to  the first  author (or  designated
author).

Camera ready copies of the final versions of accepted papers must be received
by the publisher in the USA by 24th April 1995.

Note that at least one  author of each accepted  paper is required to  attend
the conference to present the work.

General

Authors should submit six (6) copies of  their papers in hard copy form.  All
paper submissions  should be  to  the following  address. Electronic  or  fax
submissions cannot be accepted.

IJCAI-95 Paper Submissions,
American Association for Artificial Intelligence,
445, Burgess Drive,
Menlo Park, CA. 94025, USA.

(telephone (415) 328-3123, email ijcai@aaai.org).

Appearance and Length

Papers should be printed on  8.5'' x 11'' or A4  sized paper. They must  be a
maximum of 15 pages long, each page having no more than 43 lines, lines being
at most  140mm long  and with  12 point  type. Title,  abstract, figures  and
references must be included within  this length limit. Papers breaking  these
rules will not be considered for presentation at the conference.

Letter quality  print is  required. (Normally,  dot-matrix printout  will  be
unacceptable unless  truly of  letter quality.  Exceptions will  be made  for
submissions from  countries  where  high  quality  printers  are  not  widely
available.)

Title Page

Each copy of the paper must include  a title page, separate from the body  of
the paper. This should contain:

* Title of the paper
* Full names, postal addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email
  addresses (where these exist) of all authors. The first postal address
  should be one that is suitable for delivery of items by courier service
* An abstract of 100-200 words
* A set of keywords giving the area/subarea of the paper and describing the
  topic of the paper. This information, together with the title of the paper,
  will be the main information used in allocating reviewers.
* The following declaration:
   ``This paper has not already been accepted by and is not currently under
     review for a journal or another conference. Nor will it be submitted
     for such during IJCAI's review period.''

Policy on Multiple Submissions

IJCAI will not accept any  paper which, at the  time of submission, is  under
review for a journal or another conference. Authors are also expected not  to
submit  their   papers  elsewhere   during  IJCAI's   review  period.   These
restrictions apply only  to journals  and conferences, not  to workshops  and
similar specialized presentations with a limited audience.

Review Criteria

Papers will be subject to peer review, but this review will not be  ``blind''
(that is, the reviewers will be aware of the names of the authors). Selection
criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and  significance
of results and the quality of  the presentation. The decision of the  Program
Committee, taking into  consideration the individual  reviews, will be  final
and cannot be appealed.  Papers selected will  be scheduled for  presentation
and will be printed in the proceedings. Authors of accepted papers, or  their
representatives, are expected to present their papers at the conference.

Distinguished Paper Awards

The Program  Committee will  distinguish one  or more  papers of  exceptional
quality for special awards.  This decision will in  no way depend on  whether
the authors choose to enhance their paper with a video presentation.

Other Calls

Calls for  tutorial  and  workshop  proposals  and  video  presentations  for
IJCAI-95 will be issued shortly.

                     CALL FOR PARTICIPATION: IJCAI-95

IJCAI-95 will take  place at the  Palais de Congres,  Montreal, August  20-25
1995.

The biennial IJCAI  conferences are  the major forums  for the  international
scientific exchange and presentation of AI research. The Conference Technical
Program will include workshops, tutorials, panels and invited talks, as  well
as tracks for paper and videotape presentations.

PAPER TRACK: SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES

Topics of Interest

Submissions are invited on substantial, original, and previously unpublished
research in all aspects of AI, including, but not limited to:

* Architectures and languages for AI (e.g. parallel hardware and software for
  building AI systems)
* Artistic, entertainment and multimedia applications.
* Automated   reasoning   (e.g.  theorem   proving,   abduction,   automatic
  programming, search,  context  management  and  truth  maintenance systems,
  constraint satisfaction, satisfiability checking)
