                      Hoegaarden, Belgium
                    September 26 - 29, 1994


The European Knowledge Acquisition Workshops are concerned with all
aspects of elliciting, acquiring and modeling knowledge and its role
in the construction of knowledge systems. Papers are invited on
relevant topics, including but not restricted to:

 * Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modeling

 * Tools and techniques for knowledge modeling

 * Tools and techniques for sustained knowledge acquisition, knowledge
   refinement and knowledge validation.

 * Integration of knowledge acquisition with other techniques, such as
   learning systems.

 * Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge
   acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge engineering.

 * Integration of  knowledge  acquisition  techniques  within  a  single
   system;  integration of knowledge acquisition systems with other systems
   (hypermedia, database management systems, simulators, spreadsheets).

 * Methods and techniques for reuse of knowledge and knowledge models,
   in particular related to the construction, maintenance and use of
   supporting libraries.

Workshop attendance will be limited to 40 participants, one author for
each paper accepted.  The duration of the workshop will be 4 days. It
consists of invited talks, plenary sessions and working groups on
selected issues. Authors are invited to formulate an issue that would
be useful to discuss. Software demonstrations related to presented
papers are also encouraged.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Four copies of a full-length paper (up to 20 pages) should be sent to
Luc Steels (see address below) before March 28, 1994.  Acceptance
notices will be mailed by May 30,1994.  Camera-ready copies should be

The European Knowledge Acquisition Workshops are concerned
with all aspects of elliciting, acquiring and modeling
knowledge, its role in the construction of knowledge systems
and for enhancing knowledge use in organizations. Papers are
invited on relevant topics, including but not restricted to:

* Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge
modeling

* Tools and techniques for knowledge modeling

* Tools and techniques for sustained knowledge acquisition,
knowledge refinement and knowledge validation.

* Integration of knowledge acquisition with other
techniques, such as learning systems.

* Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge
acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge
engineering.

* Integration of knowledge acquisition techniques within a
single system; integration of knowledge acquisition systems
with other systems (hypermedia, database management systems,
simulators, spreadsheets).

* Methods and techniques for reuse of knowledge and
knowledge models, in particular related to the construction,
maintenance and use of supporting libraries.

Workshop attendance will be limited to 40 participants, one
author for each paper accepted. The duration of the workshop
will be 4 days. It consists of invited talks, plenary
sessions and working groups on selected issues. Authors are
invited to formulate an issue that would be useful to
discuss. Software demonstrations related to presented papers
are also encouraged.

/tex/latex/llncs.zip (or get /tex/plain/plncs.zip) prompts
either advice on how to use the mail server or direct
transmission of the LaTeX (or TeX) style files. In case of
problems in getting or UU-decoding the style files
compressed for transmission please contact
spinger@vax.ntp.springer.de

Both paper and electronic submission should be NOTIFIED by a 
mailmessage (cfr. form below). Authors who intend to submit 
a paper are encouraged to notify the organizing committee by 
returning the form below. 

Acceptance notices will be mailed by May 30,1994. 

Camera-ready copies should be prepared preferably in LaTeX 
using the llcn style file (cfr. editor's instructions). 
This final manuscript should be returned in electronic form 
before July 7, 1994.
