                              PARLE'94
             (PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES AND LANGUAGES EUROPE)

        June 13-17, 1994-- Intercontinental Hotel, Athens-Greece

Parallel processing is a discipline of strategic significance within the 
Information Technology sector. The PARLE conferences have been established
as major events of world wide reputation, where Academia and Industry meet
to exchange ideas and discuss key issues of common interest. PARLE'94 will
build upon the successes of the previous conferences and will cover the full
spectrum of parallel processing, ranging from theory to design and applications
of Parallel Computer Systems.

PARLE'94 will include tutorials covering advanced parallel processing techniques
and an exhibition featuring many of the leading international suppliers of 
parallel machines and software.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors should send five paper copies of a full draft in English and not 
exceeding 6000 words to the official conference mailing address (see below)
before 19 November 1993.

A cover page should contain the author's full name, address, telephone number,
FAX number, e-mail address and a 100 word abstract together with a few keywords
(taken from the list of conference topics above). To allow submissions to be
refereed blind, the author's identity should appear only on the cover page.

Authors of high quality papers that cannot be included in the main conference
session but deserve presentation will be invited to participate in a poster
session to be held during conference. An A-4 page summary of such papers will
be published in the proceedings. Authors must include whether or not they
would accept such an invitation on the cover sheet. Authors will be notified
of acceptance by 11 February 1994. Camera ready copies of accepted papers
will be required by 18 March 1994.

=========================================================================
A best paper award will be presented at the conference. Also a best
paper award will be presented for contributors of age under 30, provided
they are the principal authors of the paper.

           PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES AND LANGUAGES EUROPE

                         JULY 4-7, 1994 

                  ATHENS INTERCONTINENTAL, GREECE

OVERVIEW: PARLE is an international conference focusing on the parallel
processing subdomain of Informatics/ Information Technology. Is is organized
annually on a non-profit making basis to act as a European forum for interchange
between those working or interested in the domain, from both academia and 
industry.

PARLE94 has been designed to be attractive for a very wide range of audience.
It will appeal to academic researchers and students working in the field of
parallel processing or related areas. It will also appeal to industrial workers
in the area wishing to discover the latest ideas, techniques and approaches.
The tutorial programme offers an opportunity for anyone interested in learning
about state-of-the-art in some of the newest, most exciting areas of parallel
processing from world renowed experts. The industrial programme, consisting
of both vendor presentations and an exhibition, offers the opportunity to
gain first hand experience of the commercial products available today.

PARLE94 offers an unrivaled opportunity for anyone interested to learn more
about parallel processing, whether expert or novice.

PARLE 94 is organized under the auspices of the Council of European Informatics
Societies (CEPIS).
