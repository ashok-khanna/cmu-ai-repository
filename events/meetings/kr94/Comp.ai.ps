                 KR'94 - Program and Registration Information

                      Fourth International Conference on
            Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

                          Gustav Stresemann Institut
                               Bonn, Germany

                              May 24-27, 1994

With support from the Gesellschaft fuer Informatik, the Austrian  Society  for
Artificial Intelligence, the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of In-
telligence, and the European Coordinating  Committee  on  Artificial  Intelli-
gence;  in  cooperation  with the American Association for Artificial Intelli-
gence and the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc.

                                 ABOUT KR'94

KR'94, the first in its series to be held in Europe, provides a more  intimate
setting  than that of general AI conferences for researchers studying explicit
representations of knowledge manipulated by inference algorithms,  which  pro-
vide an important foundation for much work in Artificial Intelligence from na-
tural language to expert systems.

The  conference  emphasizes  both  the  theoretical  principles  of  knowledge
representation  and  reasoning  and the relationships between these principles
and their embodiments in working systems.  Presented  papers,  invited  talks,
panels,  and  audience  discussion  will address the following important ques-
tions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real problems,
    and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation  and  rea-
    soning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge  representa-
    tion systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding approaches  in
    other  parts  of  AI (natural language, robotics, etc.) or in other fields
    (psychology, philosophy, logic,  economics,  cognitive  science,  computer
    science, management, engineering, etc.)


                                  LOCATION

The KR'94 Conference will be held at the Gustav Stresemann Institut  (GSI)  in
Bonn,  Germany. The GSI is located just south of the downtown area within easy
reach of the main train station. Major airports are Cologne/Bonn (with regular
bus  service to downtown Bonn), Duesseldorf (1 hour by train) and Frankfurt (2
hours by train). Registered participants  will  receive  detailed  information
about the GSI and how to get there.

                               INVITED TALKS

Beyond Ignorance-Based Systems,
W. A. Woods --- Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Inc., USA

The field of artificial intelligence has a long tradition  of  exploiting  the
potential of limited domains.  While this is beneficial as a way to get start-
ed and has utility for applications of limited scope,  these  approaches  will
not  scale  to  systems  with  more  open-ended  domains  of  knowledge.  Many
"knowledge-based" systems actually derive their success as much from ignorance
as  from  the knowledge that they contain.  That is, they succeed because they
don't know any better.  Too great a reliance on a closed-world assumption  and
default reasoning in a limited domain can result in a system that is fundamen-
tally limited and cannot be extended beyond its initial domain.

If the field of knowledge-based systems is to move beyond this stage, we  need
to  develop  knowledge  representation  and  reasoning technology that is more
robust in the face of domain extensions. Nonmonotonic reasoning becomes a lia-
bility  if the fundamental abilities of a system can be destroyed by the addi-
tion of knowledge from a new domain.  This talk will discuss some of the chal-
lenges  that we must meet to develop systems that can handle diverse ranges of
knowledge.


Non Standard Theories of Uncertainty in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Didier Dubois --- IRIT-CNRS Universite' Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France

The last 15 years have witnessed a noticeable but  scattered  research  effort
towards  a  rational  theory of plausible reasoning.  While Bayesian nets have
recently blossomed in this area, the role of logic  and  symbolic  representa-
tions  continue  to be prominent.  Besides, the monopoly of probability theory
as a tool for modelling uncertainty has been  challenged  by  alternative  ap-
proaches  such  as  belief  functions and possibility theory.  Current efforts
search for a knowledge representation framework that combines  the  merits  of
classical  logic and Bayesian probability.  The aim of this talk is to try and
provide a perspective view of uncertainty  theories  in  plausible  reasoning.
The lecture will touch on the following issues:

   - The use of ordering relations in uncertainty modelling and  its  link  to
     non-monotonic reasoning.
   - The problem of compositionality, and the difference between partial truth
     (as in fuzzy logic) and uncertainty.
   - Why Bayesian probabilities might be questioned in  reasoning  tasks  that
     are not decision-driven.
   - The importance of representing generic, exception-tolerant, knowledge  as
     distinct from uncertain evidence in plausible reasoning tasks.
   - The analysis of three forms of belief  change:  updating,  revision,  and
     focusing and their role in defeasible inference systems.


Knowledge Representation Issues in Integrated Planning and Learning Systems
Jaime Carbonell --- Carnegie Mellon University, USA

Advances in Machine Learning and in non-linear planning systems in  Artificial
Intelligence have proceeded somewhat independently of Knowledge Representation
issues.   In essence, both fields borrow from KR  the  very  essentials  (e.g.
typed  FOL,  or simple inheritance methods), and then proceed to address other
important issues.  However, the increasing sophistication of integrated archi-
tectures  such as SOAR. PRODIGY and THEO at CMU (that combine problem solving,
planning and learning) place new demands on their KR  infrastructures.   These
demands  include  reasoning  about  strategic  knowledge  as  well  as factual
knowledge, supporting representational shifts in domain knowledge,  and  meta-
reasoning  about  the  system's  own  reasoning  and  learning processes.  The
presentation will focus on the PRODIGY architecture and its needs and implica-
tions  for KR, especially when these may be in divergence with the primary ac-
tive topics in modern KR research.

                                REGISTRATION

Due to space limitations and the success  of  earlier  KR  conferences,  early
registration is strongly recommended.

                 FEE SCHEDULE (all fees are in German marks)

Early: Registration and payment received by April 15, 1994
        Regular DM 600
        Student DM 330
        Banquet DM  80 (optional)
Late: Registration or payment received after April 15, 1994
        Regular DM 700
        Student DM 400
        Banquet DM  80 (optional)

The registration fee entitles participants to

  + attend all Invited Lectures, Technical Sessions, and Panels
  + receive all conference documentation including the conference proceedings
  + attend the reception on Monday
  + lunch and dinner during the time of the conference
  + morning and afternoon refreshments


                                  HOUSING

We reserved rooms at the Gustav Stresemann Institut  at  the  following  rates
(per night and per person, breakfast included):

       single room DM 95
       double room DM 75

Rooms will be allocated at a first-come first-served  basis.  We  reserve  the
right  to  change  a  reservation from double to single room if demand exceeds
supply.

To book a room, please fill in the room reservation section on  the  registra-
tion form and return it to the conference office.  Please note that rooms can-
not be occupied before 5 p.m. on Monday, May 23.  However, it is  possible  to
stay at the GSI over the weekend following the conference (Friday-Sunday).

Rooms need to be prepaid at the time of registration except for  extra  nights
following the conference.


                               SOCIAL EVENTS

On Monday evening, 5:00-10:00 p.m., a buffet style dinner will be  offered  to
set the stage for an informal get-together.

The banquet on Wednesday evening will be a knight's  meal  at  the  castle  of
Linz.   The  participants  will  be  taken to Linz by boat. The boat will sail
along the beautiful Rhine valley and also pass by the historically interesting
bridge  of  Remagen. This was the very last bridge destroyed by the Germans at
the end of World War II.
