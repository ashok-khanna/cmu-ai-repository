EXPERT SYSTEMS '93 CONFERENCE (ES93)
DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY; SUCCESSES IN APPLICATION


The UK's leading conference on expert systems -- Expert Systems '93
takes place from 13th to 15th December 1993 at St John's College,
University of Cambridge.

It is the thirteenth annual conference of the
British Computer Society's Specialist Group on Expert Systems (SGES).
We continue to build on our previous successes by this year presenting
a multi-track conference and tutorials over three days.

This is a conference to suit a wide audience.
For the expert systems technologists there are over twenty fully referred
papers on new advances in disciplines ranging from model based reasoning to
rule induction. Important new papers on verification & validation and
knowledge engineering methodology are being presented.

We have dedicated a full parallel session over the two days to applications.
For expert systems practictioners, applying the technology to meet business
needs, papers include applications in scheduling, condition monitoring and
design. The applications cover a variety of industry sectors ranging from
aerospace through manufacturing to finance.

In addition, we have arranged for two speciaist groups to combine with ES93.
This has enabled us include the Poplog Environment Applications track
and the HEFCs' Knowledge Based Systems Initiative track.

To encourage new organisations to introduce expert systems we have included an
extra day before the conference papers for in-depth tutorials.
In this way everyone can make a positive start in understanding the technology
and successfully applying it.

We are confident that ES93 will have the widest possible appeal to the
industrial, commercial and academic communities throughout Europe.
