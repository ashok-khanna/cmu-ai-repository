                ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS IN  ENGINEERING 

                          November 13 -16, 1994
                         Marriott Pavilion Hotel
                           St. Louis, Missouri
============================================================================

 ANNIE '94 will be held on November 13 - 16, 1994, at Marriott's Pavilion 
Hotel in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, USA. This will be the fourth 
international gathering of researchers interested in engineering applications 
of neural networks. The previous conferences drew approximately 150 papers 
each from twelve countries and their proceedings were published by ASME press 
as hardbound books titled Intelligent Engineering Systems Through Artificial 
Neural Networks edited by Drs. Dagli, Kumara and Shin, Intelligent Engineering 
Systems Through Artificial Neural Networks, Vol 2 edited by Drs. Dagli, Burke 
and Shin, and Intelligent Engineering Systems Through Artificial Neural 
Networks, Vol 3 edited by Drs. Dagli, Burke, Fernandez, and Ghosh.

 The conference will cover the theory of artificial neural networks and its 
applications in the engineering domain. The objective of the conference is to 
bring together researchers in the field of neural networks and exchange ideas 
on their applications to engineering problems. Presentations dealing with 
artificial neural network implementations in manufacturing, process control 
and monitoring, manufacturing feature recognition, image processing, control, 
hybrid systems, neurally based networks, chaos, wavelets, and optimization are 
encouraged.
