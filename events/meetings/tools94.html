Held every year since 1989, TOOLS EUROPE is the largest  and
most  important  European   conference   entirely devoted to
Object-Oriented technology and its applications.

TOOLS EUROPE is characterized by a double emphasis:  techni-
cal  quality  and  relevance  to practitioners.  This year's
conference will continue this tradition. In addition,  TOOLS
EUROPE   1994   will   for  the  first  time  include  three
specialized conferences  devoted  to  major  object-oriented
languages and their applications: C++ And Objects, Eiffel In
Action and Smalltalk World.

The Proceedings will, as with earlier conferences,  be  pub-
lished  by  Prentice  Hall.  This  provides authors with the
guarantee that accepted papers will have the widest possible
international distribution.

The conference will combine  invited  talks  by  experts  of
world repute from both industry and academia; tutorials on a
wide range of O-O topics at the beginner,  intermediate  and
advanced  levels; panels on the issues of direct interest to
the  community;  an  exhibition  of  products  and  services
featuring the latest development in the field; and technical
papers selected from the contributions submitted in response
to the present Call for Papers.


SUBMISSIONS
=-=-=-=-=-=

Articles, panels and tutorials may be submitted  for  either
the  general program (March 7-10) or for one of the special-
ized conferences (March 10-11). Authors  who  are  not  sure
where  their  contribution  fits are welcome to consult with
the conference co-chairs (by e-mail to <tools@tools.com>).

All submissions will be  refereed  and judged both on techn-
ical  quality  and  on relevance to practitioners. The stan-
dards are the same for the specialized  conferences  as  for
the  general program; all accepted articles, for any part of
the program, will be published in the Proceedings.

Submissions to the specialized conferences should address  a
theme specifically connected to the C++, Eiffel or Smalltalk
approach (respectively) and its  applications.   A  specific
call for papers is available for each conference.

A  non- exhaustive  list  of suggested topics for  the  gen-
eral conference includes:

O-O technology and seamless development. O-O data bases. O-O
analysis,  design  and  user interfaces. O-O project manage-
ment. Reusability: achievements, policies,  production   and
distribution    of    high-quality    standard   components.
Reports  of  experiences  with  O-O   technology.  Empirical
and field studies.

TOOLS EUROPE 94 will devote a whole track to  the  issue  of
seamlessness   in   O-O    development.   Contributions  are
expressly sought in this area.

All submitted articles should be in the range of  8   to  15
single-spaced   pages   and   written  in  English.   (Note:
Submissions in French are acceptable for C++ And Objects.)

To maximize their chances of acceptance, prospective authors
should  get  a copy of the ``GUIDELINES FOR TOOLS AUTHORS''.
The guidelines are available by paper or e-mail (see below).

Note: E-mail submissions are only acceptable for panel  pro-
posals,  for tutorial proposals, and for submissions to Eiffel In Action.
For such submissions, you should receive  an e-mail  acknowledgment  within
one  week.  Note the earlier deadline for tutorial and panel proposals.


PANEL AND TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

All panel proposals should  include  a  description  of  the
proposed topic, the name, address and brief biography of the
proposed panel chair, and the list  of  expected  panelists.
Important: it is the responsibility of the panel proposer to
secure the acceptance of all expected panelists before send-
ing the proposal.

Although there is no fixed format  for  tutorial  proposals,
any  such  proposal should include the following elements: a
summary of the proposed tutorial; an indication of its level
(beginner,  intermediate,  advanced);  a  biography  of  the
presenter(s), including a  list  of  any  earlier  tutorials
presented;  and  any supplementary materials (such as copies
of publications by the presenter) which  can  help  evaluate
the  proposal.  Tutorials at TOOLS are normally one half-day
(four hours including  a  break).  The  following  types  of
tutorials are particularly sought for TOOLS EUROPE 94:

Any presentation of a topic of high potential  interest  and
not  yet covered in conferences.  Any tutorial with a strong
practical  content,  or  based  on  significant   industrial
developments.   A non-partisan survey of the major solutions
available in a certain area (tools,  environments,  methods,
languages,  standards  ...),  based  as  much as possible on
actual experience rather  than  just  knowledge  though  the
literature.  An  in-depth, non-partisan critical survey of a
specific solution (in any area as defined above)  which  has
attracted  much  attention and is of interest to a wide seg-
ment of the community.


OTHER O-O MEETINGS IN CONNECTION WITH TOOLS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Many special interest groups on object-oriented  topics  use
the opportunity of TOOLS to organize one of their regular or
exceptional events.   Examples  in  previous  years  include
meetings  of  user groups for Objectory, Ontos, C++, Eiffel,
Smalltalk and others, as well as standards committees.

Such meetings this year can take place on Friday, March  11,
or Saturday, March 12.

As in previous conferences, the TOOLS EUROPE  94  organizers
will  help  find a room in Versailles.  The events will also
be advertised in the final TOOLS program, of  which  several
hundred thousand copies will be mailed in late 1993.  If you
are interested in setting up such a meeting, please  contact
the Organization Committee for details at the address listed
below.

TOOLS is the major international conference and exhibition devoted to
the applications  of object-oriented  technology.  TOOLS USA '94, the
fourteenth TOOLS International Conference  and Exhibition, returns to
Santa Barbara  for the  fourth time and  continues the  commitment to
excellence demonstrated by earlier conferences in Europe, the Pacific
and the US. Standards established for TOOLS by earlier conferences in
the series include:

     + Emphasis on the practice of object-oriented technology and its
       application in industrial environments, complementing the more
       academically-oriented perspective of traditional conferences.

     + Solid technical program, based on a strict refereeing process.

     + Balanced coverage of the  wealth  of  approaches,  trends  and
       variants in the object-oriented community.

     + Combination of tutorials  by  recognized  experts,  up-to-date
       exhibitions   of  products  and  services,  invited  talks  by
       innovators in  the  field,  relevant  panel  discussions,  and
       technical papers targeted to industry practitioners.

As with previous  conferences,  the  TOOLS  14  Proceedings  will  be
published by Prentice-Hall and made available worldwide.

SUBMITTING A PAPER

TOOLS USA '94 is now soliciting papers  on  all  aspects  of  object-
oriented technology. All submitted papers will be refereed and judged
not only according to standards of  technical  quality  but  also  on
their  usefulness  to  practitioners  and applied researchers. A non-
exhaustive list of suggested topics includes:

     + Reports of experiences with O-O technology
     + Migration toward O-O software development
     + Management and training issues
     + O-O user interfaces, persistence and databases
     + Class management and evolution
     + Empirical and field studies
     + Production, distribution and revenue collection of
       industrial-quality reusable components

TOOLS 14 will feature a special  track  on  issues  relating  to  the
migration  from  conventional  to  object-oriented  programming. This
track will include workshop(s),  tutorials,  panel  discussions,  and
featured  speakers.  Technical  papers  are  expressly sought in this
area.

Papers should be  in the  range of 10 to 20  double-spaced pages.
Six copies  of each submission should be sent to:

THE INTERNATIONAL OBJECT-ORIENTED WEEK

Friday, August 5 has  been  set  aside  for  independently  organized
events,  such  as  User Group meetings or standardization committees.
The TOOLS USA '94 organizers will help coordinate such events if they
fall within the scope of object-oriented techniques, and will include
the announcements in the final TOOLS program.  If you are  interested
in setting up such a meeting, please contact the conference chair for
details at tools@tools.com.
