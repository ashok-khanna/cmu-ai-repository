              THE FIRST WORLD CONGRESS
         ON INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING

                          February 13-17, 1995

                                   Symposium
                                          on
 LINGUISTIC GEOMETRY AND SEMANTIC CONTROL
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------


       ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

This Symposium is the first of its kind. It will focus on the presentation 
of new results, the dissemination of ideas, and cross-fertilization 
of the two emerging paradigms in Artificial Intelligence and Control
Theory,
Linguistic Geometry and Semantic Control. Both paradigms, their mutual
promotion and interchange, promise the development of new approaches 
and advanced tools for Intelligent Manufacturing and other areas.

The purpose of Linguistic Geometry is to accomplish applications to
manufacturing, space navigation, robotics, planning, scheduling, VLSI
design and other systems. This research includes the development of
syntactic tools for knowledge representation and reasoning about
large-scale hierarchical complex systems. It relies on the formalization
and transfer of search heuristics of highly-skilled human experts that have
resulted in the development of successful applications in different areas.
It is based on the broad application of the theory of formal languages and
grammars. The syntactic tools allow us to decompose complex systems into 
a dynamic hierarchy of subsystems in the form of hierarchical networks of
paths, 
and thus solve intractable problems by reducing the search dramatically.

Semantic Control deals with the synthesis of solutions to problems that do
not lend themselves to formulation and analysis via classical
methodologies. Several solutions to problems of this kind have been
reported in the areas of transportation and defense. Common to all is the
use of a multi-disciplinary approach, using systems theory, artificial
intelligence, operations research and computational methods. By their 
very nature such solutions can manipulate both quantitative and qualitative
data. Semantic Control offers a formal framework for the synthesis of
hybrid solutions through a hierarchical paradigm that comprises an
Identifier, a Goal Selector, and an Adapter.

Papers are sought that develop theory and methodologies related to the
Linguistic Geometry and Semantic Control paradigms. Of interest are
applications to manufacturing, planning and scheduling, transportation,
defense, communications, policy making, etc.

All the papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee. Papers accepted
for the Symposium will be published in the Congress Proceedings and should
be presented at the Symposium by one of the authors. Selected papers will
be recommended for publication in "International Journal on Robotics and
CIM" and "Journal on Intelligent Manufacturing."

Prospective authors are requested to send four (4) copies of a draft paper
written in English. Paper must be received by October 30, 1994.

The draft paper should be clearly typed in English, on one side of white
bond paper, A4 or 8 1/2 x 11" with at least 1" margins on all sides. Papers
will not be accepted by fax or any other electronic means. The paper should
have a title page stating the title of paper, the names, affiliations and
complete addresses of all its authors. The main author will be identifiedby
her/his telephone and fax numbers, email address. All submissions should
include an Abstract, 200 words or less, and a list of 5 keywords.

Please limit papers to a maximum length of 12 pages, single-spaced
including figures, tables and references. The paper should identify the
area to which it belongs (Linguistic Geometry, Semantic Control, or both).
A $50.00, non-refundable, paper processing fee must accompany each
submission. For accepted papers the fee will be applied toward registration
for the Congress.
