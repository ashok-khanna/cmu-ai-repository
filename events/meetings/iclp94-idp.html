                ICLP'94 Post-Conference Workshop on
                INTEGRATION OF DECLARATIVE PARADIGMS

                          June 17-18 1994
                   Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy


The integration of declarative paradigms and, in particular, the
integration of functional and logic programming, was an active area of
research some years ago. New models and languages were proposed and it
was shown that the new paradigm is feasible.

Recently, interest for this kind of languages has been spurred anew,
especially for what concerns efficient implementation. Currently, there
is active research in:

* Design of new programming languages accounting for a mature and
  up-to-date understanding of previously studied features meant to improve
  the expressive power of declarative languages (lazy evaluation,
  higher-order objects, types, object orientation, etc...).

* Development of efficient implementations. The proposals combine
  existing techniques from logic programming (e.g., WAM, mode analysis,
  abstract interpretation) and functional programming (e.g., graph
  reduction, strictness analysis, optimization of deterministic
  computations) as well as new techniques (e.g., combination of
  normalization and narrowing, residuation and coroutining,
  parallelization).

* Integration with other paradigms, like the inclusion of
  constraints, real-time programming, visual programming, etc.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from
different communities as well as to give the logic programming
community an idea of recent advances in the area. Hence, the workshop
may contribute to close the gap between the different communities and
create a good opportunity for exciting discussions. The workshop is
open to all topics concerned with the integration of declarative
paradigms. A non-exhaustive list is the following: language features,
semantics, execution principles, implementation issues, abstract
interpretation of integrated languages, environments for integrated
languages. We encourage communications in new implementation
techniques and novel integrations of declarative paradigms.
System demonstrations are also welcome in the case the ICLP organization
will provide adequate hardware.

SUBMISSIONS:
Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to submit
extended abstracts by March 28, 1994 to the contact address below.
Manuscripts should not exceed 5 pages. Electronic submissions
in Tex/LaTex/DVI/Postcript format are strongly encouraged.
They will be notified of acceptance/rejection by May 1, 1994.
The final version is due to May 15, 1994.
We plan to produce a technical report containing the extended
abstracts of all accepted presentations.
