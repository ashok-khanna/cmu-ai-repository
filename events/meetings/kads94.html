KADS MEETING 1994

after three successful meetings in Munich the fourth KADS meeting is
awaiting your participation March, 24-25, 1994, at GMD, Sankt Augustin
(close to Bonn, Germany). It should be particularly  mentioned that
contributions to knowledge engineering environments OF ALL KINDS - not only
KADS - will be taken into account provided the relationship or difference
to KADS is explicitly addressed. 

If you wish to attend the meeting, please return the following preparatory

Call for Papers

4th KADS Meeting, March, 24-25, 1994,
GMD, Sankt Augustin

The GI special interest group 1.5.1 Knowledge Engineering will organize the
4th KADS Meeting at GMD in Sankt Augustin. The workshop is open for any
contributions related to the development and application of the KADS
methodology. We also encourage contributions deviating from KADS that focus
on the differences and discuss advantages and drawbacks. Many applications
will include both knowledge-based and other components. For such systems,
it is  highly important that not only the software but also the
methodologies  are compatible - if not the same. A special focus will
therefore be on the integration and compatibility of knowledge engineering
approaches with other software-engineering methodologies.   
The  topics of the workshop are:    
   
- Applications
  - Review of succesful or unsuccessful applications of the methodology
  - Application or applicability to systems with knowledge-based and       
               conventional software components
 
- Compatibility and integration with other (KBS and conventional
  software engineering) methodologies
- Library support for problem-solving methods, interpretation models, and  
               domain ontologies; and links to other software libraries
- Structure preserving design and implementation: myth or reality?

This list is not exclusive. The contribution should clearly state the
addressed topic on its first page, and  - if applicable - relate it to the
above list. Submitted papers will be considered for publication in the
workshop proceedings.  A  subset of the papers will be selected for
presentations during the workshop. The workshop will also provide the
opportunity to present work in form of posters and software demonstrations.
It is planned to invite distinguished speakers to report on results of the
KADS-II project and on applications. 

Submission deadline: January, 7, 1994
Submission requirements: Three copies of a paper (max. 20 pages), a poster
(max. 4 pages), or the announcement of a software demonstration should be
sent 
to Hans Voss (address below).
Notification of presentation:February, 11,1994
Registration deadline: March, 4, 1994
Location: GMD, Sankt Augustin
