Eighth International Workshop on Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems
     June 7-10th, 1994 --- Nara-Ken New Public Hall, Nara, Japan

 			Call for Papers

Following the continued success of the Qualitative Reasoning (QR)
Workshops, the eighth international workshop will be held at Nara-Ken
New Public Hall, Nara, Japan.  Papers are invited on any topic
relevant to Qualitative Reasoning, including (but not limited to):

 * Ontologies and cognitive modeling (e.g., space, time, fluids, etc.)
 * Explanation, causality and teleology
 * Mathematical formalization of QR
 * Management of multiple models (formalization, architecture, studies)
 * Model building tools
 * Qualitative interpretation of numerical information
 * Task-level reasoning (e.g., design, diagnosis, etc.)
 * Practical applications of QR (e.g., real time systems, tutoring)
 * Integration with other techniques (e.g., dynamics, uncertainty, etc.)
 * Methodologies for selecting/classifying QR methods

Papers will be selected according to their quality, significance,
originality, and potential to generate discussion and will be
published as working papers only; no copyright will be requested.  A
paper must not exceed 5000 words, excluding references and abstract.
To promote an active discussion amongst participants, attendance at
the workshop will be by invitation only.

People who wish to attend the workshop without submitting a paper
should send a letter describing their background and research
interests to the workshop chair by the paper submission deadline.
Limited financial assistance may be available for students interested
in attending.

There are two ways of writing error-free programs.
But only the third one works!
