       WORKSHOP ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING APPLICATIONS

                   March  9-11, 1994

This workshop presents the fundamentals of digital signal processing and 
provides hands on experience with the implementation of digital signal 
processors. The principles of sampling theory and discrete-time systems are
covered as introductory materials. This is followed by an introduction to 
Motorola's DSP56000 family: architecture, addressing mode and instruction set.
Finite impulse and infinite impulse filters, fast Fourier transform, adaptive
filters and spectral estimation are discussed, designed and implemented with 
Motorola's DSP56000 Family.


Location:

Purdue University
School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis
Department of Electrical Engineering
723 W Michigan Street
Indianapolis, IN 46202
(317) 274-4559


Workshop Instructor:

Mohamed El-Sharkawy, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at IUPUI. 
He received his Ph.D. from Southern Methodist University. He is the 
coordinator of the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory sponsored by 
Motorola Inc. He is the author of three textbooks: "Real-Time Digital Signal 
Processing Applications with Motorola's DSP56000 Family", Prentice-Hall 1990, 
"Signal Processing, Image Processing and Graphics Applications with Motorola's
DSP96002", Vol. I and II, Prentice-Hall, 1994. In addition, he
published several papers in the areas of digital signal processing and 
communications.

Course Fee: $600.00
