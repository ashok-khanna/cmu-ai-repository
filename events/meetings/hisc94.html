                           HISC workshop in RIACA
         
                 HUMAN INTERACTION FOR SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION
                 ------------------------------------------

          Research Institute for Applications of Computer Algebra, 
                Amsterdam, The Netherlands, March 10-11 1994



  The main goal of the HISC workshop is to investigate new paradigms to 
  improve Human Interaction with Symbolic Computation software.  

  Clearly, user interfaces for computer algebra systems have already 
  improved a lot as the most advanced front-ends allow, for instance, 
  mixing text, graphics, and formulas, shrinking paragraphs, browsing
  the on-line manual using hypertext mechanisms, etc.  
  Other efforts were made to improve interaction with theorem provers.

  However, many problems are poorly or not at all addressed by present 
  user interfaces.  Taking advantage of previous work, the workshop will 
  focus on highlighting new research directions to simplify the use of 
  symbolic computation software.  These include:
  * direct manipulation of subexpressions involving both syntactic and 
    semantic aspects; 
  * representation and interactive manipulation of exotic mathematical 
    objects; 
  * efficient communication between the application and the interface;
  * intelligent session management providing support to users solving 
    non-trivial problems;
  * interaction with theorem provers/checkers such as COQ, LEGO, etc;
  * use of alternative input technologies -- such as voice or pen; 
  * algorithm animation and efficient browsing of complex data structures;
  * ...

  The HISC workshop is also connected to the ACELA project of interactive 
  mathematical books for Lie Algebra.

  The workshop will be conducted in English and is limited to 30 participants.
  Attending the workshop is free, short presentations and software 
  demonstrations are welcome.


  A preliminary program will be posted by February 15th.

                         ADDRESSES AND DIRECTIONS
                         ------------------------

  The IBIS Centre Hotel is conveniently situated directly next to the Central 
  Station.  People arriving by train will find it 100 meters on their right 
  when exiting the Central Station.
  People arriving by plane should catch a train from the airport to the
  Central Station.  Trains run every 20 minutes from 6am to 11pm.
  The trip costs Dfl 5.5 and lasts about 20 minutes.  
  HISC special rate makes the room at Ibis hotel cost: Dfl 136 (or Dfl 121.50 
  without breakfast).

  Transportation from the hotel to the place of the workshop will be arranged
  by RIACA: a special bus will leave the hotel at 9.45 on March 10th and
  8.30 on March 11th.  The same bus will bring people back to the hotel after
  the workshop (it will leave CWI at 17.15, which means that people leaving on 
  Friday could easily be at the airport before 19.00).

  The address of the 'Ibis Hotel Centre' is:
    Stationsplein 49
    1012 AB Amsterdam
    Tel.: (020) 638 99 99

  The workshop will be held in the CWI building:
    Room Z 011
