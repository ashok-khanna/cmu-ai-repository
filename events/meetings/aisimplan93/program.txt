4th Annual Conference

Artificial Intelligence, Simulation, and Planning in High
Autonomy Systems

Tucson, Arizona

September 20-22, 1993

sponsored by
The University of Arizona
and Rand Corporation

Doubletree Hotel
Tucson, Arizona

Conference Theme:

Integrating Virtual Reality and Model-Based Environments

This is the fourth in a series of annual meetings dedicated to
advancing the integration of high autonomy systems simulation and
other knowledge- based methodologies.  This conference will focus
on virtual reality (VR) concepts and technologies.  VR systems
integrate visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli to create
model-based environments that can be experienced and manipulated by
users.  Application of virtual reality environments include combat
modeling and battlefield simulators, medical applications, 
manufacturing systems design, robotics, and scientific
visualization.  In addition, traditional simulation environments
can be greatly enhanced in their user-interface capabilities with
VR techniques. A special feature will be the application of VR
simulation environments to management of large-scale ecosystems
processes.
