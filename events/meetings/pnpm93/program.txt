The workshop provides a forum for the presentation of original
contributions in the area of models based on Petri-Ntes and including
time specifications and tools for performance evaluation and system
design.

Topics
------
* New developments in timed and stochastic Petri nets, including
high-level stochastic nets

* Analysis methods for timed and stochastic nets

* Advances in incorporating time into nets, while retaining the
results of General Net theory

* Relationships with other formal systems where timed extensions are
being developed (e.g process algebras, formal description techniques ...)

* Application of nets to the design and performance evaluation of
systems including computing, commnications and time constrains :
multimedia, office automation, flexible manufacturing systems,
communication networks, real time systems, operations researsh ...

* Computer aids for the analysis of Petri nets models

* Educational issues, including the role of Petri nets in teaching
concurrency
