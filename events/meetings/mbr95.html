				CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
		WORKSHOP: INNOVATIONS IN MODEL-BASED REASONING

    	LOCATION: Melbourne Beach, Florida
		WORKSHOP DATE: April 26, 1995 

				
				Organizing Committee:

					Robert Morris

				Avelino Gonzalez 
			University of Central Florida


				Invited Speaker:
			
				Peter Struss

				Workshop Description:

This workshop will serve as a forum to define and explore
issues related to, and present innovative applications of,
reasoning based upon knowledge about the structure and function 
of a system (Model-Based Reasoning, or MBR).  The workshop is 
planned as a one-day event to immediately precede FLAIRS-95
(The Eighth Annual Florida Artificial Intelligence
Research Symposium, April 27-29). The workshop will be
conducted as a combination of paper presentations, an invited
talk, and a panel discussion. The format will provide ample time 
for the exchange of ideas. The workshop registration fee will be 
waived for those who register for the FLAIRS-95 conference.
Among topics of interest to the workshop are the following:

Inference mechanisms that take advantage of explicit
structural and behavioral knowledge; target system complexity;
qualitative/quantitative, analog/discrete, and mixed domains;
computational limits and speed/accuracy tradeoffs; principles 
of model construction; types of uncertainty in models; problems 
and solutions in knowledge acquisition; functional/physical model 
relationships; and innovative applications and systems which employ MBR.
Acceptance will be limited to 30 papers and 10 or fewer presentations.
There will be a proceedings of all accepted submissions.  More formal 
publication will be pursued if there is sufficient interest. Single page 
abstracts of each attendee's paper or work in MBR will be distributed 
prior to the workshop.


					Submission Guidelines:

The submission format will be short, self-contained papers of no more
than 2000 words. Three copies of submitted papers should be sent to
