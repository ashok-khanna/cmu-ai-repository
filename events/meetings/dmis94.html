Introduction

In 1994, the working conferences on dynamic modelling and information
systems will be organized for the fourth time. Three successful DYNMOD
conferences have been held in 1990 (the Netherlands), 1991 (USA), and
1992 (the Netherlands). In 1994, the "Fourth International Working
Conference on Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems" will take
place on September 28-30, in Noordwijkerhout, the Netherlands. In 1992
we decided to organize this conference biannually to enable the
presentation of really new research results.


Objective

Dynamic modelling is an approach for analyzing dynamic aspects of
organizations and their information systems. The approach recognizes
that activities happen concurrently in organizations, and that methods
are needed to model concurrency within organizations and information
systems. The objective of the International Working Conferences on
Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems is to bring together
interested information systems users and developers, researchers and
educators for cross-fertilization and exchange of information and
ideas. The expectation is that continued development of dynamic models
of information systems will lead to better organizational problem
solving and the solution of a number of real-world problems in
information systems development and operation.

At this fourth conference, special interest will be paid to comparing
different approaches for dynamic modelling, to the construction of
professional tools for dynamic modelling, to empirical studies on
dynamic approaches of information systems analysis and design, and to
the transfer of the technology to government and commercial
organizations.


How to Submit

The papers to be submitted for this conference cover several areas,
including:
 -    formal representations
 -    petri-nets
 -    simulation and animation
 -    dynamic modelling tools and dynamic CASE tools
 -    workflow analysis and tools for administrative logistics
 -    dynamic approaches for business process redesign
 -    empirical research and the use of dynamic modelling in practice

If you wish to participate in the conference, please fill in the
enclosed form and send it to the address below. If you intend to submit
a paper, please give the (provisional) title as well. The papers that
may be presented on the conference and that will be included in the
published conference proceedings will be chosen after blind reviewing.
Full papers can be up to 30 pages in length and occasionally even more.
During the conference, ample time will be given for the presentation
and the discussion of each paper. In addition, 

One copy of either an extended abstract (6 pages or more) or a full
paper (20-30 pages) should be sent by e-mail to:
a.verbraeck@is.twi.tudelft.nl, or four copies should be sent by regular
mail to:

      Dr. Alexander Verbraeck
      Program Chair DYNMOD-IV
      Dept. of Information Systems
      Delft University of Technology
      P.O. Box 356, 2600 AJ Delft, The Netherlands

These abstracts should be submitted before March 1, 1994. If possible,
please send in the enclosed form as well. The notifications of
acceptance and rejection will be sent around April 15, 1994. Camera
ready copies of the full paper are due September 1, 1994. The papers
that have been presented at the conference will be included in the
published proceedings, if necessary after slight revisions.
