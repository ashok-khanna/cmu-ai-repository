		      Machine Learning Workshop
                                 AI'94
              Canadian Artificial Intelligence Conference
                            Banff Park Lodge
                         Banff, Alberta, Canada
                            May 16-20, 1994

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together people who are
active in applications or (theoretical or experimental) studies of
machine learning. Participants in related fields such as computational
studies of human learning, genetic algorithms and neural nets are also
welcome. The emphasis of the workshop will be on informal
communication and exchange of ideas. A small fee will be charged to
cover costs.

SUBMISSIONS: Please submit an extended abstract (of not more than 4000
words) and a short (not more than 1000 word) summary of current work
by email (text or Postscript) to bruce@cpsc.ucalgary.ca.  A paper will
be required for accepted contributions, and these will be collected
together in a workshop proceedings as a technical report.
