14th International CODATA Conference

"DATA AND KNOWLEDGE
IN A CHANGING WORLD"

CODATA'94
Committee on Data for Science and Technology
of the International Council of Scientific Unions

18-22 September 1994
Chambery - Savoy - France

LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

SESSION : "KNOWLEDGE AND DATA INTERPLAY"

==========================================================

CODATA

CODATA, an interdisciplinary Scientific Committee of the International 
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), seeks to improve the quality, 
reliability, management and accessibility of data of importance to all 
fields of science and technology. CODATA participates on various levels in 
the interpretation and modelling processes provided by quantitative 
contributions of data, information and knowledge collected either 
experimentally or created through computer simulation. CODATA naturally 
takes part in multidisciplinary and wide ranging problem analysis through 
its experience in computerised data treatment.

CONFERENCE

The conference will be organised around sessions in the area of scientific 
and technical data challenges in the traditional sectors of industry, 
physics and chemistry as well as bio-, geo- and space sciences. 
International and national mission-oriented institutions, agencies and 
scientific societies are collaborating in its organisation. To provide an 
appropriate framework for discussions, the Conference will be centred around 
three main symposia : environment, materials and communication. 

"COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN OF SYSTEMS AND OF COMMUNICATION"  SYMPOSIUM

This symposium will bring together experts dealing with large data systems, 
complex data handling, networking and cross-discipline communication. The 
goal will to be improve access to and utilisation of different  types of 
scientific and technical databases. 
In order to cover the different aspects of this subject, the symposium will 
be divided into sessions.

"KNOWLEDGE AND DATA INTERPLAY" SESSION

Until recently, knowledge and data in science were often confused. Knowledge 
models (e.g object) is often associated with artificial intelligence 
applications (expert systems and knowledge base systems), but their 
importance for Database Management Systems is growing.

The papers to be submitted for this session cover several areas including :

- knowledge representation, (classification, retrieval, data meaning)
- object oriented models
- databases 
- interaction between databases and knowledge bases

papers describing applications are welcome.

HOW TO SUBMIT

You are invited to submit an abstract of 500 words or more  to :

Prof. Christophe ROCHE
LGIS - Universite de Savoie
73 376 Le Bourget du Lac cedex
France
fax : (33) 79 75 88 88
e-mail : roche@univ-savoie.fr

The abstracts should be submitted before May 1st, 1994. The notifications of 
acceptance or rejection will be sent before June 1st, 1994. The papers 
presented at the conference will be included in the published proceedings 
(full papers should be sent before 1st September).
