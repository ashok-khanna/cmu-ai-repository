			      IEEE WORLD CONGRESS ON
			    COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

		      Orlando, Florida, June 26-July 2, 1994
		  Sponsored by the IEEE Neural Networks Council

The 1994 IEEE World Congress on Computational intelligence consists of three
IEEE International Conferences:  The Third IEEE International Conference on
Fuzzy Systems, IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, and The IEEE
Conference on Evolutionary Computation.  The registration fee for the Congress
covers admission to all three of the Conferences as well as to a special five-
day Symposium entitled "Computational Intelligence:  Imitating Life."  This
Symposium will be held Monday, June 27, through Friday, July 1, 10:20 am to
12:40 pm.

				 SPECIAL SYMPOSIUM

		    COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  IMITATING LIFE

THE SYMPOSIUM addresses critical and emerging technologies and issues relating
to biologically, psychologically, and linguistically motivated models that
exhibit various facets of computational intelligence.  The paradigms discussed
include learning, reasoning, evolution, search, and optimization each of which
often uses life imitating metaphors for guiding model building.  Machine
learning from data, neural and fuzzy information processing, approximate
reasoning, and evolutionary computation are examples of computational intelli-
gence approaches addressed by Symposium speakers.  The Symposium provides a
unique forum for cross-fertilization between the areas of neural networks,
fuzzy logic, and evolutionary computing.

SYMPOSIUM presentations are explicitly targeted toward the identification of
challenges, issues, and potential solutions for problems arising in computa-
tional intelligence.

THE SYMPOSIUM consists of 3 public lectures, 10 plenary talks, and 30 mini-
symposia presentations, covering Neural Networks (21), Fuzzy Logic (13), and
Evolutionary Computation (9).  Contributions include recent research that has
implications for further progress, state-of-the-art reviews, and discussions of
important applications in fields such as biology, signal and imaging
processing, robotics and control.  Presenters have been chosen from academia
and industry and represent the leaders in their fields from throughout the
world.

THE SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS "Computational Intelligence:  Imitating Life," will
be published and available at the Congress for each participant.  Proceedings
will later be distributed by the IEEE Press.


		      INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL THREE CONFERENCES

		   Papers must be received by December 31, 1993

Papers will be reviewed by senior researchers in the field, and all authors
will be informed of the decisions at the end of the review process.  All
accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings.  Please
submit the following:

 - Send one original and five copies of the paper.  Six total.
 - Papers must be camera ready on 8 1/2 x 11 white paper, two-column
   format in Times or similar font style, 10 points or larger with one
   inch margins on all four sides.
 - Do not fold or staple the original camera-ready copy.
 - Four pages are encouraged, however, the paper must not exceed six
   pages, including figures, tables, and references.  Papers over six
   pages will not be considered.
 - Papers must be written in English.

Authors are encouraged to use the WCCI LaTex template with the IEEEtran. sty
style sheet.  (The format is similar to that used in IEEE transactions.)
These documents can be FTP'd using the following instructions:
	FTP FTP.AI.SRI.COM
	LOGIN:  ANONYMOUS
	PASSWORD:  <USE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS AS THE PASSWORD)
	(AN SRI INFORMATION DOCUMENT WILL SCROLL.  AFTERWARDS, TYPE ...)
	CD PUB/IEEE
	GET READ.ME
	BYE

Centered at the top of the first page should be the complete title, author
name(s), affiliation(s), and mailing address(es).  In the accompanying letter, the following information must be included:

 - Full Title of the Paper
 - Corresponding Author (Name, Mailing Address, Telephone and FAX Number)
 - Technical Session (First and Second Choices)
 - Presentation Preferred (Oral or Poster)
 - Presenter (Name, Mailing Address, Telephone and FAX Number)
