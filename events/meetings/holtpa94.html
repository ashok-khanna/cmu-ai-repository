Subject: Call for Papers.
Date: Sat, 12 Feb 94 16:59:03 +0000


The attached call for papers may be of interest to members of these
mailing lists.  Please note that it is *not* the conference organizers
intention to solicit papers only on the HOL system -- relevant papers 
on other theorem provers for higher order logic are very welcome!

I apologise to those who have already seen this on info-hol.

  +===============================================================+

  This meeting is the seventh in a series of annual workshops on
  higher order logic theorem proving and its applications.  Previous
  workshops were held in Cambridge, Aarhus, Davis, Leuven, and
  Vancouver. The 1994 meeting will be held at the Foundation for
  International Studies, University of Malta, between 19 and 22
  September.


  TOPICS
  ======

  The programme committee invites papers on all topics related to
  higher order logic theorem proving and its applications, with a
  primary focus on the HOL system and/or other theorem provers for
  higher order logic. The topics of interest include, but are not
  limited to, the following:

    * Extensions to, and enhancements of, the HOL system.

    * Applications of mechanized higher order logic.

    * Industrial experience of higher order logic theorem proving.

    * Comparison of the HOL formulation and other higher order logics.

    * Comparison of HOL and other theorem provers.

    * Implementation issues for higher order logic theorem provers.  
    
    * Linking HOL (and related systems) to other theorem provers.
  
  All submissions to the workshop will be reviewed by referees
  appointed by the programme committee.


  VENUE
  =====

  Malta is a small island in the centre of the Mediterranean. It has a
  wealth of history, a reputation for warm hospitality, and an
  excellent climate.  The workshop will be held at the Foundation for
  International Studies, which is housed in the Capital, Valletta, in the
  original premises of the Collegium Melitense.


  INVITED SPEAKERS
  ================

  The preliminary list of invited speakers is

    N.G. de Bruijn
    Thomas Forster
    Mike Gordon
    Keith Hanna


  SUBMISSIONS
  ===========

  Potential authors are invited to submit papers under two categories:

    A) full research paper.
    B) informal progress report. 

  Submissions accepted under category A will appear in the formal
  proceedings of the workshop.  Category B is intended to provide a
  relatively open venue for the discussion and sharing of preliminary
  results; those wishing to submit progress reports and other
  preliminary results under category B are strongly encouraged to do
  so and should clearly mark their submissions as such. Copies of all
  papers accepted under category B will be distributed at the
  workshop, but not in the formal published proceedings. A paper submitted
  under category A may, at the discretion of the programme committee,
  be accepted under category B.

  All authors of accepted papers and progress reports will be asked to
  present their work at the conference.  If, however, time constraints
  make it necessary, then authors of category B submissions may be
  asked to present their work in a poster session.
 
  All submissions should have at most 4500 words and must include an
  abstract of at most 150 words.  All submissions must be clearly
  labelled with the submission category and accompanied by full
  contact information (contact person, email address, telephone
  number, and postal address).  The Programme Chair should receive four
  hard copies of any submission in advance of the submission deadline,
  21 March 1994.

  Electronic mail submissions in the form of Postcript are also welcome.
  Such submissions should be sent to the following address
   
    hug94@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk

  Only Postcript can be accepted, and authors must ensure that their
  papers can be printed on both A4 and 8.5x11 inch paper.  All 
  submissions received by electronic mail will be acknowledged.


  IMPORTANT DATES
  ===============

    * Deadline for submissions: 21 March 1994
    * Notification of acceptance/rejection: 16 May 1994
    * Camera-ready copy due (category A papers): 13 June 1994
    * Camera-ready copy due (category B papers): 15 August 1994
    * Workshop: 19-22 September 1994

  The relatively early date for categogy A camera-ready copy reflects 
  the intention of the organizers to have the published proceedings 
  available at the conference itself.
