General Information
The International Symposium on Programming Language Implementation
and Logic Programming is held every year. The aim of PLILP'93 is
to explore new declarative concepts, methods and techniques relevant
for implementation of all kinds of programming languages, whether
algorithmic or declarative ones. The intension is to gather researchers
from the fields of algorithmic programming languages as well as logic,
functional and object-oriented programming. PLILP'93 will take place
in Tallinn, Estonia, from August 25 - 27.

Estonia is a corner of the earth on the eastern shores of
the Baltic Sea: a little over 45.000 square kilometers in
size, 350 kilometers from west to east and 240 from north
to south, inhabited by 1,5 million people. Men settled in
these areas ten thousand years ago.

Tallinn, the capital of the Estonia, is situated on the southern
shore of the Gulf of Finland and is one of the oldest cities in
Europe, to be found already on the world map compiled in 1154.
Resisting the onslaught of time, the old citadel with the fortress
on Toompea, the town hall, the circular walls studded with defence
towers have made Tallinn a museum city. Parks, gardens and its
green belt cover 30% of its territory.
Tallinn has an active academic life: there are 8 higher educational
establishments and 12 institutes of the Estonian Academy of Sciences.

PLILP'93's predecessors have been held in:
             Orleans 1988,
             Linkoping 1990,
             Passau 1991,
             Leuven 1992.

The following program contains 24 selected talks out of
72 contributions in response to the Call for Papers.
Several Papers were selected for Posters Session.

Invited speakers are Neil D. Jones, Uwe Kastens, Adnrey Mantsivoda,
and Alexander Dikovsky.

In parallel to the talks there will be system demonstration
about new implementations in the area of functional, logic
and object-oriented programming languages.
