AI'94 is the Seventh Australian Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence. AI'94 is conducted under the auspices of the Australian
Computer Society's National Committee for Artificial Intelligence and
Expert Systems. The theme of the conference is "Sowing the Seeds for the
Future". AI'94 will be hosted by The Department of Mathematics, Statistics,
and Computing Science at The University of New England, between Monday
21st. November to Friday 25th. November 1994.

A pre-conference workshop is scheduled on the 22nd. November 1994. Both
symbolic and non-symbolic AI researchers are encouraged to propose whole
day or half-day workshop programs. Topics of interest include, but not
limited to:

Artificial Life, Automated Reasoning, Behaviour-Based Control, Belief
Revision, Case-Based Reasoning, Cognitive Modelling, Common Sense
Reasoning, Communication and Cooperation, Constraint-Based Reasoning,
Computer-Aided Education, Connectionist Models, Corpus-Based Language

Learning, Machine Translation, Mathematical Foundations, Multi-Agent
Planning, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Nonmonotonic
Reasoning, Perception, Planning, Probabilistic Reasoning, Qualitative
Reasoning, Reasoning about Action, Reasoning about Physical Systems,
Reactivity, Robot Navigation, Robotics, Rule-Based Reasoning, Scheduling,
Search, Sensor Interpretation, Sensory Fusion/Fission, Simulation, Situated
Cognition, Spatial Reasoning, Speech Recognition, System Architectures,
Temporal Reasoning, Terminological Reasoning, Theorem Proving, Truth
Maintenance, User Interfaces, Virtual Reality, Vision, 3-D Model
Acquisition.

Individual Workshop Coordinators will be responsible for soliciting
appropriate papers, organising paper review and selection. AI'94 will
provide logistic support for conducting the workshops. Each proposal must
have a title page (separate from the body of the proposal) containing the
title of the workshop, the names and addresses of all coordinators,
telephone number, fax number and electronic mail address. The body of the
proposal should consist of a short (less than 1000 word) description
indicating the relevance of your workshop proposal to the theme of AI'94.

Please submit your workshop proposals to the following address no later
than 15th. April 1994.
