            Call for Workshop Participation (KRDB-94)

               REASONING ABOUT STRUCTURED OBJECTS:
             KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION MEETS DATABASES
                   (in conjunction with KI-94)

        Saarbruecken, Germany, September 20 to 22, 1994

Object-centered formalisms for domain modeling play an
important role both in knowledge representation (KR) and in
the database (DB) area. Nevertheless, there has been little
cross-fertilization between the two areas. Research in databases
was mostly concerned with handling large amounts of data that are
represented in a rather inexpressive formalism, whereas KR concen-
trated on intensional inferences in relatively small knowledge
bases. However, many of today's problems demand sophisticated
reasoning on complex and large-scale objects.
The workshop is intended to bring together researchers from both
areas to identify and discuss problems and applications where the
combination of KR and DB techniques may provide new solutions.

TOPICS
For the following (non-exclusive) list of questions, such a
combination seems to be most promising:

  * KR formalisms as schema languages in DB:
    Is it possible to specify realistic DBs this way?
    Can the inference mechanisms from KR support the schema
    design?

  * Distributed information sources:
    How can one describe their interaction in a changing
    environment?

  * Advanced query processing:
    How can schema knowledge be utilized for query optimization?
    How can it be used to generate intensional answers?

ORGANIZERS
Franz Baader and Manfred Jeusfeld (RWTH Aachen, Germany)
Martin Buchheit and Werner Nutt (DFKI Saarbruecken, Germany)

ORGANIZATION
The workshop will be held in conjunction with the German AI
Conference (KI-94), in the afternoons of September 20 to 21.
Potential participants should apply by submitting a position
paper of about 5 pages to the address given below. Based on
these papers, the participants will be organized into groups
that present their contribution in a panel. There will be two
introductory talks by Maurizio Lenzerini (Rome) and Marc Scholl
(Ulm), who have successfully applied KR techniques in the DB
area.
Participants of the workshop must register for the conference
KI-94. Further information on this conference can be obtained
from ki-94@dfki.uni-sb.de.

SUBMISSION
Position papers of about 5 pages should be sent by May 1, 1994 to

  krdb-94@picasso.informatik.rwth-aachen.de     or

  Manfred Jeusfeld
  RWTH Aachen - Informatik V
  D-52056 Aachen, Germany

Although we accept hardcopies we strongly prefer E-mail
submissions. If possible, please send compressed and uuencoded
.dvi or .ps-files. Abstracts of the position papers (1-2 pages,
in English) will be printed in a supplement to the KI-94
conference proceedings, and handed out to all conference
participants.

DEADLINES
Submission of papers:         May   1, 1994
Notification of acceptance:   May  15, 1994
Abstracts for supplement:     June  1, 1994
