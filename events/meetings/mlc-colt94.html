	        MLC-COLT '94 WORKSHOP ON ROBOT LEARNING
			July 10th 1994
		   Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ
		----------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION OF WORKSHOP:
------------------------

Building a learning robot has been acknowledged as one of the grand
challenges facing artificial intelligence.  Robotics is an extremely
challenging domain for machine learning: sensors generate huge noisy
state spaces, actions are often continuous, and training time is very
limited.  The area of robot learning has witnessed a surge of activity
recently, fueled by exciting new work in the areas of reinforcement
learning, behavior-based robotics, genetic algorithms, neural
networks, and artificial life.  The goal of this workshop is to
discuss/communicate research ideas from these and other relevant
fields on building learning robots.

This workshop will focus on tasks and learning methods appropriate for
real robots. Many techniques look promising on simulations, but fail
to work on real robots because they take too long, or require
information that cannot be computed reliably from sensors.  This
workshop will also discuss a common format for making training data
available across the Internet to enable researchers without access to
real hardware to contribute their ideas and expertise to robot
learning.

We encourage researchers from several different research areas,
including robotics, machine learning, planning, vision, and neural
nets to attend this workshop. This diversity will facilitate
interaction among disparate research groups who face similar problems.
Researchers with knowledge of real robots are especially encouraged to
attend to share their experience.

TOPICS:
-------

The workshop will include (but is not limited to) the following
topics:

1. ADAPTIVE CONTROL ARCHITECTURES: This includes work on
learning new behaviors, learning to coordinate existing behaviors,
and learning in hybrid declarative-reactive architectures.

2. PERCEPTUAL LEARNING: This includes building categories 
from sensor data, such as learning to recognize visual objects, or
clustering sonar data. 

3. LEARNING SPATIAL MAPS: This includes work in the area of
robot navigation. 

4. LEARNING ARM CONTROL AND MANIPULATION: This includes
learning to control robot arms, and learning to pick up objects. 

5. LEARNING WITH DOMAIN-SPECIFIC BIAS: Many learning researchers have
come to the conclusion that tabula rasa learning is not effective for
robots.  If that is so, we must add domain-specific bias in some form.
What should it be?  Examples include teaching, pre-specified
behavioral structure, and pre-specified low-level behaviors.

6. COMPARATIVE STUDIES: Lastly, the workshop will also
encourage comparative studies among different learning methods,
particularly those done using real robots.

FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP:
-----------------------

The workshop will begin with an overview of the current state of the
field, followed by short presentations of current research. There may
be one or two invited talks if time permits. There will be a video
session featuring demos of learning robots. Finally, there will be a
panel discussion to summarize what we've learned and discuss issues
for future research. We plan on also getting together for a workshop
dinner after the workshop.

CALL FOR PAPERS:
----------------

Researchers interested in presenting their work are encouraged to
submit papers to the workshop. Please follow the same formatting
guidelines used in the regular ML conference (i.e. 12 pages in Latex
12 pt article style excluding title page and bibliography, but
including all tables and figures). Four copies of each paper should be
mailed to the Chair (see address below). The deadline for receiving
papers is May 1. Authors of accepted papers will be notified by May
21st, and camera-ready papers should be submitted by June 15th. We
will try to distribute the workshop proceedings before the workshop.

CALL FOR VIDEOS:
----------------

We also encourage researchers to submit short videos featuring their
robots. We will accept all videos if they are reasonably short (no
more than 10 minutes). Depending on the number of submitted videos,
and the time constraints for the overall length of the video session,
further editing may be required.

ATTENDANCE:
-----------

Attendance in this workshop will be by invitation only. All
researchers interested in attending this workshop should submit a one
page abstract outlining their current and previous work in robot
learning.  In order to maximize the degree of interaction among the
participants, we will give priority to authors of accepted papers,
invited speakers and panelists, and researchers who have had
experience in working with real robots.
