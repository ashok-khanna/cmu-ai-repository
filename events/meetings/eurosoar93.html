WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS/PARTICIPATION

EuroSoar Workshop-7

19th-21st November 1993
Department of Psychology, University of Nottingham
Nottingham, England

The Seventh European Workshop on Soar will be held in Nottingham,
England on the weekend of 19th-21st November 1993.  The Workshop will
be of interest to researchers in Europe actively working with Soar or
interested in doing so.  Soar is a unified theory of cognition
realized as a problem-space architecture in an AI production system
language.  Events will include invited and submitted talks reporting
recent Soar research in Europe and North America, and demonstrations
of Soar work.

People travelling from outside Nottingham will probably want
to stay in Nottingham on the Friday night as well as the Saturday
night, as the workshop will start with dinner at 7pm on Friday night,
and finish at 3pm on Sunday.

Attendance will be limited to 50 participants.  Preference will be
given to active Soar researchers and those who submit their forms
promptly.

An introductory tutorial will be held on the afternoon of Friday 19th
November, intended to enable newcomers to Soar to benefit from and
contribute to the main part of the workshop.  The tutorial will
include sessions on the basic concepts of Soar, current research
issues, a demonstration of Soar in use, and a survey of current Soar
activity worldwide.  Given a suffient level of ability on the part of
the participants, it may attempt to teach very basic Soar programming.
