Workshop Site

ISPACS '93 will be held at the Aoba Memorial Hall, Tohoku
University, Sendai, Japan.   Sendai, the City of Trees, is
located in the northeast region   of Japan.  It is 350 km
north from the capital city of  Tokyo and is only 2 hours
away from Tokyo by the  Tohoku bullet train.  It is also one
and half hour flight  from Osaka.  It is reached by some
international airlines  including Singapore (7.5 hour
flight) and Seoul or Pusan  (2 hour flight).  The city, with
a population of 1,000,000  has a warm climate and is blessed
with four separate and  beautiful seasons.  The workshop
site, Aoba Memorial  Hall, is located at the campus of
Faculty of Engineering,  Tohoku University, Sendai.

Address: Aramaki-aza-Aoba, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980, Japan
Phone: +81-22-222-1800   Ext. 5138


Transportation

Railways

Sendai is one of the major JR railway centers along the
Tohoku line (between Tokyo and Aomori), it is also a major
stop for the super-express train on the Tohoku Shinkansen
line (between Tokyo and Morioka).  Sendai is only 4 hours
from Narita, Tokyo international Airport.  An approximately
80-minute ride from JR Narita airport station, which is in
the first basement of Tokyo International Airport, on the
Narita express will take you to Tokyo station.  The Tohoku
Shinkansen super-express trains (bullet trains) depart for
Sendai about every 30 minutes from the No.12 and No.13
platforms in Tokyo station.  Sendai is a 2 hour ride from
Tokyo.  Getting the three tickets at JR Narita airport
station is convenient: the passenger ticket from Narita to
Sendai (6700 Yen), the express ticket for the Narita express
(1630 Yen: Narita-Tokyo) and the super-express ticket for
the Tohoku Shinkansen (4720 Yen. Tokyo-Sendai). 


Airways

Sendai Airport is located in Iwanuma, about 15 km south 
of Sendai.  One can take a bus to Sendai Station from the 
airport.  The bus fare is 780 yen (as of 1993).  To Sendai 
Airport, flights from Sapporo, Hakodate, Niigata, 
Komatsu, Nogoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Okinawa are 
available.  International air service from Guam (USA), 
Saipan (USA) and Seoul (Korea) is also available.  
However there is no air service between Narita (Tokyo 
International Airport) and Sendai.

Buses

The Sendai city bus is convenient for coming to the 
Faculty of Engineering from Sendai station, and leaves 
Sendai station (Bus stop No.9) approximately every 30 
minutes.  It takes about 20 minutes to arrive at the 
"Kogakubu" bus stop in front of the Faculty of 
Engineering.  The administration office building is located 
to the right of the bus stop.  The fare from Sendai station 
to the Faculty of Engineering ("Kogakubu" bus stop) is 
200 yen and is paid when getting off.

Taxis

You may take a taxi to the Faculty of Engineering from 
Sendai Airport or Sendai Station.  The fares are about 
1300 yen from Sendai station and 5000 yen from Sendai 
airport.  Taxis can be caught at the taxi stands in front of 
Sendai Airport or Sendai station.

REGISTRATION

Advance Registration

Although attendees may register upon arrival at the 
workshop, advance registration by mail is strongly 
encouraged. The number of participants at the workshop 
will be limited to about 140 people due to the size of the 
workshop room. Advance registration with prepayment 
will not only minimize the need to wait at the registration 
desk, but also guarantee your registration in the limited 
capacity of participants. Registration form and payment 
must be received at Tohoku University before September 
27 for advance registration.  

Registration Desk

The registration desk will be open during the following 
hours for pick-up of registration packets and for on-site 
registration:

Additional Information

The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Symposium will be 
held at the same site during the ISPACS'93. The DSP 
Symposium is a domestic annual conference that covers 
digital signal processing technologies; from theory to 
application. ISPACS'93 participants are entitled for 
attending all the sessions of the DSP Symposium. (There 
are some English sessions in the DSP Symposium.) If you 
need the proceedings of the DSP Symposium , a copy

TECHNICAL  PROGRAM

WELCOME MESSAGE FROM THE TPC

As modern communication systems continue to evolve, 
increasingly sophisticated techniques find widespread 
application. The purpose of this second International 
Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing and 
Communication Systems is to provide a forum for the 
presentation and discussion of emerging techniques in what 
is loosely termed intelligent signal processing. Such 
methods as nonlinear filtering and prediction, fuzzy logic 
or neural network approaches to detection and 
classification, image modeling and model-based image 
coding, and adaptive signal processing, offer the basis for 
innovative communications products and services.On 
behalf of the Technical Program Committee, we welcome 
you to ISPACS'93. We hope that you find the technical 
presentations stimulating, and that you enjoy your stay in 
beautiful Sendai!
