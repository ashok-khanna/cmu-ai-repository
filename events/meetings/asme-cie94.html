   14th ASME International Computers in Engineering Conference
                      September 11-14, 1994
                     Minneapolis, Minnesota


                    Special Call for Papers:

          Virtual Manufacturing Environments & Systems
          --------------------------------------------

  In concurrence with the focus of the 1994 ASME International
  Computers in Engineering Conference on computers and computer
  tools required to support the engineering enterprise, papers are
  invited for submission in the area of virtual manufacturing
  environments and systems.  With the ever expanding effort to
  reduce product development cycle times and the critical role of
  computers used in concurrent engineering, models of manufacturing
  processes and operations are being integrated into product
  development systems.  This effort has been reflected in efforts
  in the U.S. to develop centers investigating agile manufacturing 
  methods as well as the on-going international project in Intergrated
  Manufacturing Systems.  
  
  The focus of these sessions at the Computers in Engineering 
  Conference centers on how this integration between manufacturing 
  process models and product design methods is being accomplished, 
  environments and systems for virtual manufacturing modeling and 
  simulation, modular manufacturing methods and approaches as well 
  as issues outstanding in virtual manufacturing to be addressed.


  Four copies of papers should be submitted to:

       Dr. Yong Se Kim
       Department of General Engineering
       University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
       104 South Matthews Avenue
       Urbana, IL 61801-2996
       ph: (217) 333-1180
       fax: (217) 244-5705
       e-mail: yskimg@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu


  Deadlines for papers:

       Submission of Four Copies of Paper: February 1, 1994
       Notification of Acceptance to Authors: April 1, 1994
       Submission of Final Paper: May 1, 1994
