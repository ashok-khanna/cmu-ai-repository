	1993 AUSTRALIAN JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

           	   AI'93 REGISTRATION BROCHURE

		       GRAND HYATT HOTEL
		      MELBOURNE, VICTORIA

		      16-19 NOVEMBER, 1993


         An invitation to participate...

         On behalf of the organising committee, we are very pleased to invite you to attend AI'93, to be held in Melbourne from November 16th to 19th. The Australia AI conference has grown in stature over the years, and now attracts a growing proportion of papers from throughout the world. This year we have received over 135 papers for consideration, with around 45% coming from overseas.

         The conference programme features three world-renowned experts in very different fields of expertise. Earl Sacerdoti is known for both his pioneering work in AI, and for his work on technology transfer. Mary O'Kane is renowned for her work in speech recognition. Our third speaker, Chris Wallace, is a pre-eminent authority in machine learning. So you can be guaranteed a wide variety of invited talks. There is an extensive workshop programme, a wide range of tutorials, and active technical ses




 

         AI as a technology has not been without its problems. But there is a growing presence of real applications in operation, and a gradual understanding of the significance of the field, which is reflected in the conference programme. It is also perhaps one of the great research challenges, so we should not be surprised at the controversy that continues to surround AI.

         We look forward to meeting with you and joining in a successful conference.
