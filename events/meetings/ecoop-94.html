Call for Workshop Proposals - ECOOP '94
The Eighth European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming
Pre-Conference Workshops
Bologna, Italia
July 4-5, 1994


The 1994 Eighth European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming
will be held on July 6-8, 1994, in Bologna, Italy. Pre-conference
workshops are planned to be held on July, 4-5.
Workshops will provide an opportunity to meet and discuss issues 
with selected focus. They will also help to disseminate recent 
research results and bridge gaps between related fields. Workshop 
participants are chosen on the basis of a position paper submitted 
to the workshop organizers. 

If you wish to organize a workshop, here there are some general guidelines:

1) To encorauge real interaction and exchange of ideas, 
   each workshop will be kept small (preferably under 40 participants). 
2) The format of the workshop will be determined by the organizer(s)
   proposing the workshop, but time must planned to allow general discussion.
3) Workshop can vary in lenght, but the optimal duration will be half 
   or a full day.
4) Proposals for workshops should be approximately two pages in length,
   and should contain:
   - a description of the workshop, identifying the specific technical 
     issues that will be addressed;
   - a discussion of the relevance of the workshop for the object-oriented
     programming community at this time;
   - a proposed schedule for organizing the workshop, a preliminary agenda,
     and the indication of the lenght of the workshop (half a day, or one
     day).

Proposals should be submitted no later than February 1, 1994. Organizers 
will be notified no later than March 1, 1994.

Workshop organizers will be responsible for:
- producing a "Call for Partecipation" in the workshop and posting it via 
  various electronic lists and/or other means;
- reviewing requests to participate in the workshop and selecting 
  participants;
- scheduling the workshop activities.
