                           SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

                          PAN PACIFIC CONFERENCE
                                    ON
                         BRAIN ELECTRIC TOPOGRAPHY

                           February 10 - 12, 1994
                             SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA

INVITATION:

Brain electric and magnetic topography is an exciting emerging area which
draws on the disciplines of neurophysiology, physics,  signal  processing,
computing and cognitive neuroscience.  This conference will offer a forum for
the presentation of recent findings.  The program will include an outstanding
series of plenary lectures, as well as platform presentations by active
participants in the field.

The conference includes two major plenary sessions, one entitled "Brain
Activity Topography and Cognitive Processes," the other entitled "Brain
Rhythmic Activity and States of Consciousness."  The confirmed plenary
speakers and topics are listed below.  The plenary sessions will provide
a forum for discussion of some of the most recent developments of analysis
and models of electrical brain function, and findings of brain topography
and cognitive processes.

This conference is aimed at harnessing multidisciplinary participation and
will be of interest to those working in the areas of clinical neurophysiology,
cognitive neuroscience, biological signal processing, neurophysiology,
neurology, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry.


PLENARY SESSIONS:

"Brain Rhythmic Activity and States of Consciousness"

Walter Freeman-       Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and the Construction of
                      Macroscopic Activity Patterns in Cortex as a Prelude
                      to Conscious Experience.

Rodolfo Llinas-       The Cellular Basis for Brain Rhythms.

Shigeaki Matsuoka-    EEG and MEG Topography of Frontal Midline Theta Rhythm
                      and Source Localisation.

Yuzo Yamaguchi-       Frontal Midline Theta Rhythm and Mental Activity.


"Brain Activity Topography and Cognitive Processes"

Alan Gevins-          High Resolution Evoked Potentials as a Video of the
                      Thinking Brain In Action:  Working Memory and Language.

Steve Hillyard-       Topographical Analysis of Brain Activity Associated
                      with Selective Attention

Yoshihiko Koga-       Event-Related Potential Studies of the Automatic
                      and the Controlled Processing Systems of Sensory Inputs
                      in Schizophrenia and Senile Dementia of Alzheimer Type.

Paul Nunez-           Implications of High Resolution EEG for Cognition Studies.

Richard Silberstein-  Steady State Visually Evoked Potential Topography,
