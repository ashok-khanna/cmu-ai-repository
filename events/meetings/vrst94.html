Tutorials - August 23, 1994
---------------------------

Tutorial 1: Introduction to Virtual Reality Design

Steve Bryson, NASA Ames, USA
Steven K. Feiner, Columbia University, USA

Full day (9:00 - 17:30)

This tutorial will survey the theory and development of VR user interface
techniques. These techniques encompass a variety of hardware and
software technologies and allow natural display and control in
three-dimensional interactive environments. These technologies will be
surveyed with a focus on the design of applications. 


Tutorial 2: Three Dimensional Graphics Hardware

Tzi-cker Chiueh, State University of New York at Stony Brook, USA

Half day (9:00 - 12:30)

This tutorial will cover the basic operation primitives for 3D graphics, 
including both polygonal and volume rendering, and their hardware support. 
We will examine both the processing requirements and the display subsystems 
of 3D graphics, and focus particularly on hardware structures that exist 
in current commercial offerings such as SGI and Sun, as well as those in the
research stage as the PixelFlow machine from UNC, the Cube machine
from SUNY at Stony Brook, and the Ray Casting machine from Cornell and Duke.


Tutorial 3: dVISE - Using the Virtual Design Environment(tm) 
            with your Existing CAD Models

Pierre duPont, Division Limited, UK

Half day (9:00 - 12:30)

This tutorial will introduce participants to the dVISE Virtual Design
Environment, an interactive virtual reality authoring tool.  Its
easy-to-use interface brings virtual reality out of the research
laboratory, away from the domain of programmers, and onto your
desktop.  Working in either the traditional flat-screen or advanced
immersive modes (or both), dVISE allows you to quickly create and
experience your own virtual worlds without any software development
knowledge. The session is structured to teach through example and discussion,
rather than by lecture.  Thus you will find the tutorial full of
demonstrations and actual, live activities, and a willingness to ask
questions and participate in the design will be to your advantage.


Tutorial 4: Geometrical Modeling and Animation for VR

Mark Green, University of Alberta, Canada

Half day (14:00 - 17:30)

This tutorial will cover the basic ideas behind geometrical modeling and
animation, concentrating on the techniques that are most applicable to
the development of VR applications. The major geometrical modeling
techniques are reviewed and their use in the construction of virtual
environment is discussed. The main techniques used in computer animation
are briefly described. The emphasis is placed on behavioral animation,
which is the animation technique that best meets the requirements of
virtual environments. OML, a freely available modeling and animation 
language, is used to illustrate the various techniques covered in the
tutorial.


Tutorial 5: Graphical and Acoustical Rendering for VR

Peter Astheimer and Stefan Muller, Fraunhofer-Institute for Computer Graphics, 
                                   Germany
Half day (14:00 - 17:30)

This tutorial will describe software and hardware needed to fulfill the
realism requirements for the acoustical and graphical presentation of
immersive virtual environments. For graphical rendering, the focus will
be on the preparation pipeline of CAD-data towards a photo-realistic
presentation and on advanced rendering techniques to achieve
high-quality real time rendering. For acoustical rendering, the basic
techniques, device utilization and future prospects will be discussed.

as may be necessary.)
