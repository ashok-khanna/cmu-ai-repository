            Organizer:  P. R. Kumar 

 Invited Speakers: S. Kawaji, K. Tanaka, E. Uchino 
         S. Yasunobu and G. Vachtsevanos

   Supported by a grant from Honeywell Corporation   

                    

In recent years many successful designs based on fuzzy control
have been reported.  In  this minisymposium our aim is to
obtain first hand accounts of these control systems from the
very designers of these systems. The topics to be covered
include the role envisaged by the the designers for the fuzzy 
control methodology, a clear and step-by-step description of
the fuzzy control approach to control system design, and a
description of some of the successful fuzzy control system 
designs for trains, washing machines, cameras, automobiles,
etc. Finally, there will be a roundtable discussion featuring
both experts in fuzzy control  system design and other
approaches, for the purpose of assessing the utility of the
fuzzy approach to control system design and comparing it to
other alternative control system  design methodologies. 

The IMA has no registration fee and provides office space,
computer and secretarial support to preregistered participants
during workshops and minisymposia. To preregister for this event,
