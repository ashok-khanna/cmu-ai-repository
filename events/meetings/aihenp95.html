DEAR COLLEAGUES:
 
Preparations for the 1995 edition of the AIHENP worskshop series are underway!
AIHENP95-Pisa will be held in the spacious, modern Palazzo dei Congressi,
located in the heart of historic Pisa, near the Tuscan seaside.  Those of you
who have attended previous editions will remember that the series began in
Lyon, France, in March 1990, and has subsequently been sited in La Londe les
Maures, France, in January 1992, and, most recently, in Oberammergau, Germany,
in October 1993.
 
The AIHENP series workshops are intended primarily for scientists working
in fields related to High Energy and Nuclear Physics, and address many of the
practical problems encountered in the running and data analysis of large
experiments, including the monitoring and fault diagnosis of millions of
detector channels; software management of millions of lines of code written
by hundreds of scientists scattered around the world; control of accelerators,
ion sources, reactors, and tokomaks; data selection and pattern recognition
for complex events and physical phenomena; and the computation of lengthy
theoretical calculation to a high degree of precision.
 
With this posting, we would like to invite you to submit an abstract from
some of your recent work.  Please see the details for submission below.  Bear
in mind that the listings are guidelines;  papers on other topics that might be
of interest to the AIHENP audience are also encouraged.
 
Computer technologies evolve rapidly.  Even on the timescale of our workshop
series the scenario has changed remarkably, and High Energy and Nuclear
physicists must update their knowledge periodically in order to work
effectively  Thus it is necessary to bring together on a regular basis not
only the physicists involved in these fields, but also computer scientists,
electrical engineers, and experts from industry, in order to keep abreast of
developments which may be useful to us for future endeavors like LEPII, LHC,
the new B-Factories, the CEBAF and RHIC machines, as well as the ongoing work
at HERA and the planned upgrades of the CDF and D0 experiments at Fermilab.
 
The AIHENP series workshops have always been less formal than full conferences,
stressing new results, and with sufficient time allowed for spontaneous
discussions to develop if need be.  As in the past, the workshop will consist
of plenary sessions and three parallel sessions covering our three subgroups,
 
  1) SOFWARE ENGINEERING
  2) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
  3) SYMBOLIC MANIPULATION
 
along with possible tutorials and demonstrations, poster sessions, and a
final round-table style discussion within each subgroup.  We also expect
to invite a few experts from other fields to come and give keynote talks
which should give us some new perspectives.
 
The exact content of the workshop will be established as papers and
suggestions come in; however, as a guide, we give below a list of some of
the subjects covered in the three subgroups in past workshops, along with
some new ideas.

                            APPLICATION PROCEDURE
                            ---------------------
 
The deadline for submission of abstracts is NOVEMBER 1, 1994.  Applications
should preferably be sent by electronic mail.  Fax and postal submissions
will also be accepted.  Applications should include an abstract describing
the work done, a title and a list of authors which indicates which one is the
contact person.  The contact person should include his postal address,
electronic mail address, and telephone and fax numbers.  THE ABSTRACT PLUS
ALL ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION SHOULD FIT ON ONE PAGE.  An abstract booklet will
be prepared from these submissions so reasonable care should be taken in
preparing them.  No special format is required.
 
The application should contain an indication of the subgroup which most closely
matches the topic of the paper (i.e., 1-Software Engineering, 2-Artificial
Intelligence, 3-Symbolic Manipulation).  Papers which the author believes are
suitable for the workshop but which do not fit precisely into any of the three
subgroups will also be considered.
 
All applicants will receive an initial confirmation of receipt, which does
not necessarily indicate acceptance.  Final notification of acceptance will be
done when all the papers have been reviewed.
 
Past experience has shown that we will probably not be able to fit in
all accepted papers for oral presentation.  If so, we will try to retain
those papers with the broadest general interest for oral presentation, and
encourage authors of papers of more specific interest to consider presentation
in the poster sessions.  Applications directly to the poster sessions can
also be made.
 
All papers accepted for oral or poster presentation will be published in the
workshop proceedings, which, as in past workshops, will be a hardcover edition
with the workshop logo in color on the cover.  Qualifying papers will also
be published in a special edition of a major scientific journal.
 
Persons wishing to participate in the conference but who do not intend to
present a paper should send the same information as for a contact person,
leaving out the abstract.
 
At the moment we solicit only papers and expression of interest in attending.
Hotel bookings, etc., will be handled in a future mailing.

                            APPLICATION PROCEDURE
                            ---------------------
 
The deadline for submission of abstracts is NOVEMBER 1, 1994.  Applications
should preferably be sent by electronic mail.  Fax and postal submissions
will also be accepted.  Applications should include an abstract describing
the work done, a title and a list of authors which indicates which one is the
contact person.  The contact person should include his postal address,
electronic mail address, and telephone and fax numbers.  THE ABSTRACT PLUS
ALL ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION SHOULD FIT ON ONE PAGE.  An abstract booklet will
be prepared from these submissions so reasonable care should be taken in
preparing them.  No special format is required.
 
The application should contain an indication of the subgroup which most closely
matches the topic of the paper (i.e., 1-Software Engineering, 2-Artificial
Intelligence, 3-Symbolic Manipulation).  Papers which the author believes are
suitable for the workshop but which do not fit precisely into any of the three
subgroups will also be considered.
 
All applicants will receive an initial confirmation of receipt, which does
not necessarily indicate acceptance.  Final notification of acceptance will be
done when all the papers have been reviewed.
 
Past experience has shown that we will probably not be able to fit in
all accepted papers for oral presentation.  If so, we will try to retain
those papers with the broadest general interest for oral presentation, and
encourage authors of papers of more specific interest to consider presentation
in the poster sessions.  Applications directly to the poster sessions can
also be made.
 
All papers accepted for oral or poster presentation will be published in the
workshop proceedings, which, as in past workshops, will be a hardcover edition
with the workshop logo in color on the cover.  Qualifying papers will also
be published in a special edition of a major scientific journal.
 
Persons wishing to participate in the conference but who do not intend to
present a paper should send the same information as for a contact person,
leaving out the abstract.
 
At the moment we solicit only papers and expression of interest in attending.
Hotel bookings, etc., will be handled in a future mailing.
