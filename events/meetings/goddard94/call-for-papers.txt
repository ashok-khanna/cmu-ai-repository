                             CALL FOR PAPERS
                The Ninth Annual Goddard Conference on
                Space Applications of Artificial Intelligence
                            May 10 - 12, 1994
            NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA


Scope:

This conference will focus on AI and advanced computing technologies 
relevant to space systems, space operations, and space science. The 
major AI topics will include, but are not limited to:

        o Knowledge-based spacecraft command and control
        o Expert system management and methodologies
        o Intelligent User Interfaces
        o Distributed knowledge-based systems
        o Fault-tolerant rule-based systems
        o Simulation-based reasoning
        o Knowledge acquisition
        o Robotics and telerobotics
        o Neural networks
        o Computer Vision

while the major Advanced Computing Technologies will be:

        o Intelligent database management
        o Scientific Visualization
        o Virtual Reality
        o Planning and scheduling
        o Fault isolation and diagnosis
        o Image Processing
        o Heterogeneous Computing
        o Parallel Processing

Original, unpublished papers are now being solicited for the
conference.  Papers must describe work with a clear AI content or be
related to the above advanced computing technology topics.  
Furthermore, papers must stress the applicability of these technology
solutions to space-related problems.  Authors are asked to submit
abstracts first for initial review.

Accepted papers will be presented formally or as poster presentations,
which may include demonstrations.  All accepted papers will be
published in the Conference Proceedings as an official NASA document,
and select papers may appear in a special issue of the international
journal "Telematics and Informatics".  There will be a Conference
award for Best Paper.

Submission:

Abstracts should be 300-500 words in length.  Two copies of the
abstract should be submitted by September 20, 1993 along with the
author's name, affiliation, address, e-mail address and telephone 
number.  Notification of tentative acceptance will be given by October 
8, 1993.  Papers should be no longer than 15 pages and must be submitted
in camera-ready form for final acceptance by December 3, 1993.

Abstracts may be submitted through e-mail, FAX, or regular mail.
E-mail and FAX are preferred.
