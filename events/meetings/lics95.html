                    Tenth Annual IEEE Symposium on
                      LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
                          June 26-29, 1995
                       San Diego, California

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

The LICS Symposium aims to attract original papers of high quality on
theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to
logic in a broad sense, including algebraic, categorical and
topological approaches.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: abstract
data types, automated deduction, categorical models, concurrency,
constraint programming, constructive mathematics, database theory,
domain theory, finite model theory, hybrid systems, logics of
knowledge, lambda and combinatory calculi, linear logic, logical
aspects of computational complexity, logics in artificial
intelligence, logic programming, modal and temporal logics, model
checking, program logic and semantics, rewriting, logical aspects of
symbolic computing, software specification, type systems,
verification.

DATES:
        Submission deadline: December 7, 1994
        Notification: February 14, 1995
        Final papers due: April 5, 1995
        Conference: June 26-29, 1995

PAPER SUBMISSION: 
Send 12 copies of an extended abstract (not a full paper) to the
program chair to be received by December 7, 1994.  This deadline is
firm; late submissions will not be considered.  Authors without access
to copiers may submit a single copy.  Authors will be notified of
acceptance or rejection by February 14, 1995.  Accepted papers in a
specified format for the proceedings will be due April 5, 1995.

The first page of the extended abstract should include the title of
the paper, names and affiliations of authors, a brief synopsis, and
the contact author's name, address, phone number, fax number, and
email address, if available.

The extended abstract may not exceed 10 typed pages in no less than
11-point font.  It must be in English and provide sufficient detail to
allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.  It
should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the
main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and
relevance to the conference, all phrased for the non-specialist.
References and comparisons with related work should be included.
Technical development directed to the specialist should follow.
Submissions departing significantly from these guidelines risk
rejection.

The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops.
All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign copyright
release forms.  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to
present the paper at the conference.

The symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee on
Mathematical Foundations of Computing in cooperation with the
Association for Symbolic Logic, the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science, and the Association for Computing
Machinery.  The symposium is hosted by the University of California,
San Diego.

Kleene Award for Best Student Paper: An award of $500, in honor of the
late S.C. Kleene, will be given to the best paper, as judged by the
program committee, written solely by one or more students.  A
submission is eligible if all authors are full-time students at the
time of submission.  This should be indicated in the submission
letter.  The program committee may decline to make the award or may
split it among several papers.
