        1993 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS

        SECOND IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS

                       March 28 - April 1, 1993
                         San Francisco Hilton
                      San Francisco, California

 The IEEE Neural Networks Council cordially invites you to attend the
 Second International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE'93) and the
 1993 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'93), to be
 held concurrently at the San Francisco Hilton Hotel, San Francisco,
 California from March 28 to April 1, 1993.

 These IEEE-sponsored events have grown to become the largest conferences
 in their fields. In 1993, their importance will be enhanced by their
 combined meeting in an environment that assures that conference
 participants will have full access to all functions and events of either
 of these multidisciplinary meetings. In addition to an exciting program
 of plenary lectures, tutorial presentations, and technical sessions and
 panels, we anticipate an extraordinary trade show and exhibits program
 affording a unique opportunity to become acquainted with the latest
 developments in products based on neural-networks and fuzzy-systems
 techniques.
