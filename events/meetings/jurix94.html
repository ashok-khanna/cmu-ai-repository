			CALL FOR PAPERS

                           JURIX '94

 Seventh International Conference on Legal Knowledge-based Systems

      THEME: Legal Knowledge-Based Systems and Legal Theory

                   Friday, December 9, 1994
         University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands


The Dutch Foundation for Legal Knowledge-Based Systems (JURIX) is a
forum for research in Law and Artificial Intelligence. Since 1988,
JURIX has organized annual international conferences on current
research in the field.

CONFERENCE THEME

The theme for JURIX '94 is the relation between legal theory and
legal knowledge based systems.

It has frequently been acknowledged that formalisms to represent legal
knowledge and reasoning should use the theoretical background provided
by legal theory and legal philosophy. It has also been stated that
experiences from, and formalisms developed in legal knowledge-based systems
can provide support for legal theories. However, the nature of
the link between the two disciplines has never been explored in depth, and most
research in the field of AI & Law is not (explicitly) based on legal
theory, nor does it state implications for legal theory.

For this conference we seek contributions that address this relation,
either from a theoretical point of view, or on the basis of practical
research that exploited the relation in one way or the other.

Papers on other issues related to legal knowledge-based systems, not
related to the conference theme, are welcome too, but will be
considered for presentation only after those that adhere to the
theme.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Both paper and electronic submissions of no more than 5000
words will be accepted.

		ANNOUNCEMENT & REGISTRATION

		     JURIX '94
	Seventh International Conference on 
	   Legal Knowledge-Based Systems

THEME:  Legal Knowledge-Based Systems and Legal Theory

	     Friday, December 9, 1994
	University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands

The Dutch Foundation for Legal Knowledge-Based Systems (JURIX)
organises annual international conferences on current research in the
field of Law and Artificial Intelligence.  The theme for JURIX '94 is
the relation between legal theory and legal knowledge based systems.
It has frequently been acknowledged that formalisms to represent legal
knowledge and reasoning should use the theoretical background provided
by legal theory and legal philosophy. It has also been stated that
experiences from, and formalisms developed in legal knowledge-based
systems can provide support or new insights for legal
theories. However, the nature of the link between the two disciplines
has never been explored in depth, and most research in the field of AI
& Law is not (explicitly) based on legal theory, nor does it state
implications for legal theory.  These issues will be addressed at the
conference by invited speakers, in a panel discussion and in
presentations of accepted papers.

TUTORIALS

In keeping with this theme we have organised two tutorials to be held
immediately prior to the conference at Thursday December 8.  These two
tutorials will introduce fundamental issues in legal theory, legal
reasoning and artificial intelligence, and will provide a framework
for the discussion at the conference.

T1: "AI applications and research in Law"

The first is aimed at lawyers who have little or no understanding of
artificial intelligence applications and research in law.  It will
quickly review the major artificial intelligence approaches to legal
domains, and provide a clear and simple overview of the way in which
artificial intelligence has provided insight into legal theoretical
questions, the nature of legal reasoning and the basis of law.  It
will discuss some of the limitations of artificial intelligence in
law, as well as its great benefits.  It will examine the commercially
successful applications to date, and what we can expect in the near
future.  This tutorial will run from 9:00am to 12:30pm.
 
T2: "Law as a domain for AI and CS techniques"

The second tutorial will be aimed at computer science and artificial
intelligence researchers who may see law as a useful domain for their
techniques.  It will examine the jurisprudential models of legal
reasoning, the dominant strands of legal theory in civil law and
common law, and some legal critiques of artificial intelligence
research in law.  It will suggest a number of methods which artificial
intelligence can contribute to legal theory.  It will also pick up on
some techniques discussed in the first tutorial and examine the
validity of their application to law.  Time will be set aside for a
discussion of the legal theoretical limitations of current artificial
intelligence systems in law.  This tutorial will also be relevant for
lawyers who wish to examine the basic theoretical concepts in legal
reasoning, and see how they might be applied to artificial
intelligence.  This tutorial will run from 2:00pm to 5:00pm
 
Finally, though the tutorials will be complementary, it will not be
assumed that delegates will attend both tutorials.

Tutorial Presenters

The tutorials will be presented jointly by Dan Hunter and John
Zeleznikow.  Dan Hunter holds degrees in computer science and law, and
lectures in artificial intelligence & law and in legal theory at the
Law School, University of Melbourne, Australia.  John Zeleznikow holds
a PhD in mathematics and a degeree in computer science.  He lectures
in artificial intelligence & law and knowledge based databases at the
Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, La Trobe
University, Australia.  Together they maintain a collaborative
research project in artificial intelligence and law, have written
numerous articles on the subject, and have presented a series of
tutorials on artificial intelligence and law at international
conferences.  They are the authors of a comprehensive textbook on the
subject, entitled "Building Intelligent Legal Information Systems -
Representation and Reasoning in Law", to be published by Kluwer later
this year.

HOTEL ACCOMMODATION

Hotel accommodation can be booked upon request. Please contact the
