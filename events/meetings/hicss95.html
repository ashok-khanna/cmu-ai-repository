		    Biotechnology Computing Track
	Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 28
			   
		     Maui, Hawaii --- January 3-6, 1995

The twenty-eighth annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences
(HICSS) will include a three day conference track on Biotechnology
Computing.  The Biotechnology Computing Track provides a forum for the
interchange of ideas, research results, and system building activities in
all areas of computation related to biology.  It includes presentations of
original research, tutorials, advanced seminars and a distinguished guest
lecture.  The conference is sponsored by the University of Hawaii in
cooperation with the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the IEEE
Computer Society, and the Pacific Research Institute for Information Systems
and Management (PRIISM).

Advances in biotechnology generally and in the international Human Genome
Project are creating an explosion of fundamental biological data underlying
all life processes.  The computational problems in gathering, managing and
analyzing this explosion are daunting, but the challenges are exciting and
the potential payoff is very high.  Every aspect of computer science is
involved, from algorithm development, systems integration and advanced
database management to image analysis, parallel computing, artificial
intelligence and robotics.  The Biotechnology Computing Track presents the
leading edge of this research in five minitracks, each focused on a rapidly
evolving research area.

Relevant papers are solicited for each of the minitrack areas listed below.
Papers must be previously unpublished, and should be from 22-26 double
spaced pages in length, including figures.  Submitted papers are subject to
a rigorous peer review process with written reviews from at least five
referees.  Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
which is also made generally available by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
Prospective authors are urged to contact the appropriate minitrack chair as
early as possible.  Please leave adequate time for international mail, as
all deadlines are firm.

For general information, or proposals for tutorials, advanced seminars and
review papers, contact the track chair:
