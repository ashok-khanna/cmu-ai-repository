                               CONSTRAINT-95 
            International Workshop on Constraint-Based Reasoning 
                      (in conjunction with FLAIRS-95) 
 
                      Melbourne Beach, Florida, USA

                             CALL FOR PAPERS 
 
The purpose of this workshop is to promote interaction among active 
researchers in the area of constraint-based reasoning.  The one-day 
workshop will immediately precede FLAIRS-95 (Eighth Annual Florida AI 
Research Symposium, April 27-29).  Workshop participants are encouraged 
to also submit papers to FLAIRS-95.  The workshop registration fee is 
waived for those who register for the conference. 
 
Submission of high-quality papers or extended abstracts describing mature  
results or on-going work are invited for all areas of constraint-based  
reasoning, including, but not limited to: 
 
     exact and approximate algorithms for solution of constraints 
     complexity results 
     concurrent constraint processing
     extensions of existing constraint domains 
     formalizations of new domains 
     innovative applications 
     programming language support for constraints 
 
The size of the workshop will be limited.  Accepted papers will be invited 
for either full or poster presentation. All submissions must be 
received by November 10, 1994.  We will send notification of acceptance or 
rejection to the first author (or designated author) on February 1, 1995.  
All accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.

Prospective participants should submit 5 copies of a 5-8 page extended 
abstract to the following address.
