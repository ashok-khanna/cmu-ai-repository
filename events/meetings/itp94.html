                  June 26 -- July 2, 1994
                      Sofia, Bulgaria


                  PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

  L. Aiello (Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Italy)
  M. Mac an Airchinnigh (Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland)
  P. Barnev (Institute of Mathematics, Sofia, Bulgaria), Chairman
  H. Gaylord (University of Groningen, the Netherlands)
  J. Hoffer (Indiana University, Bloomington, USA)
  S. Joosten (University of Twente, the Netherlands)
  S. Kerpedjiev (Institute of Mathematics, Sofia, Bulgaria), Secretary
  B. Kokinov (Institute of Mathematics, Sofia, Bulgaria), Secretary
  V. Kotov (Institute of Informatics Systems, Novosibirsk, Russia)
  N. Spyratos (Universite de Paris-Sud, France)

              Darmstadt, Deutschland)
  C. Thanos (Instituto di Elaborazione della Informazione, Pisa, Italy)
  T. Vamos (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary)


                  AIM AND SCOPE

The overall goal of the Conference  is  to  gather  together
people from Western and Eastern countries, from industry and
universities, to promote contacts between  specialists  from
organisations  with  different  profiles,  to  set  up links
between different branches of computer science.


                  TOPICS

Traditionally the programme of the  conference  focusses  on
three main topics but is not generally limited to them.  For
the next year, the following topics are emphasized:

     1. COOPERATIVE PROCESSES
     (cooperative  computation,  emergent  computation   and
     self-organisation,  cooperative programming, simulation
     of social behaviour  (multi-agent  systems),  computer-
     supported   cooperative  work,  distributed  databases,
     document exchange standards and conversion  techniques,
     media richness)

     2. COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES
     (computer  technology  to  support  distance  learning,
     simulation  models,  multimedia  and hypertext systems,
     groupware,  computer  assisted  instruction,   computer
     assisted testing)

     3. COMPUTER SCIENCE IN EASTERN EUROPE
     (current state, the role of  computer  science  in  the
     development   of   the  societies  of  Eastern  Europe,
     integration  of  research,  education  and   curriculum
     issues)

and

     SUMMER SCHOOL ON COGNITIVE SCIENCE (with an emphasis on
     interdisciplinary studies)
     (cognitive models, experimental and simulation results,
     cognitive   architectures,   integration  of  different
     approaches and methods)

The programme will  include  90-minute  lectures,  30-minute
presentations  of  short  papers, discussions, a poster ses-
sion, and demonstrations.  The texts of the lectures and the
short  papers  will  be published in the Conference proceed-
ings.

The program of the Cognitive Science Summer School  will  be
announced  later. To keep you informed, please, express your
interest in the event now by e-mail  (kokinov@bgearn.bitnet)
or by writing to the contact address below.


                  CALL FOR PAPERS

Those with appropriate scientific  or  technical  experience
are invited to submit papers to the Conference.
The text in English up to 8 pages should include the  title,
authors'  names and affiliations, a brief abstract, an expo-
sition where the essence and the specific results are given,
and a bibliography. Type the manuscript on one side of white
paper, keeping the text within 240 mm  (length)  by  170  mm
(width).   Use  a  character  size of at least 12 points and
one-and-a-half spacing.  Avoid using dot-matrix printers not
in  NLQ  mode.   As  an alternative, electronic versions are
also accepted, provided that they  are  in  plain  ASCII  or
(preferably)  TEX  or PostScript format.  The papers must be
received at the Conference address not  later  than  January
15,  1994  (in  triplicate if on paper).  The papers will be
reviewed by at least two members of the  International  Pro-
gramme Committee and those accepted will be published in the
proceedings.  Accepted papers  will  be  included  into  the
Conference  programme  either for oral presentation or for a
poster session.
