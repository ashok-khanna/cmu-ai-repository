                           February 10 - 12, 1994
                              SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA

INVITATION

Brain electric and magnetic topography is an exciting emerging area which
draws on the disciplines of neurophysiology, physics,  signal  processing,
computing and cognitive neuroscience.  This conference will offer a forum for
the presentation of recent findings.  The program will include an outstanding
series of plenary lectures, as well as platform and poster presentations
by active participants in the field.

The conference includes two major plenary sessions.

In the Plenary Session entitled "Brain Activity Topography and Cognitive
Processes," the keynote speakers include Frank Duffy (Boston), Alan Gevins
(San Francisco), Steven Hillyard (La Jolla), Yoshihiko Koga (Tokyo) and Paul
Nunez (New Orleans).

Keynote speakers for the Plenary Session entitled "Brain Rhythmic
Activity and States of Consciousness," will include Walter Freeman (Berkeley),
Rodolfo Llinas (New York), Shigeaki Matsuoka (Kitakyushu)
and Yuzo Yamaguchi (Osaka).

The plenary sessions will provide a forum for discussion of some of the most
recent developments of analysis and models of electrical brain function, and
findings of brain topography and cognitive processes.

This conference is aimed at harnessing multidisciplinary participation and
will be of interest to those working in the areas of clinical neurophysiology,
cognitive neuroscience, biological signal processing, neurophysiology,
neurology, neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry.
