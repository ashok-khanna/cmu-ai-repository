DESCRIPTION:
The application of robotic technology in medicine has emerged as a rapidly evolving area that has great potential for improving patients' clinical outcome. Identifying and advancing appropriate utilization of this technology requires collaboration among the disciplines of engineering, science and medicine. The Symposium on Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery, one of the first interdisciplinary programs of its kind, will bring together technical and clinical researchers to establish the cur
tatus of this technology and explore the future direction and applications within medicine.
In addition to scientific presentations by an invited faculty who have major research interest within these areas, live surgery, exhibits, demonstrations and tours will showcase several current applications and technologies which are being investigated for the future.
Contributions are invited on research, development and practice of medical robotics and computer assisted surgery. Topics will include, but are not limited to the following:
	¥	Clinical Needs as Defined by Physicians
   	¥	Pre-operative Planning and Surgical Simulations
	¥	Robotic Vision and Medical Imaging Integration
	¥	Sensors and Modelling
	¥	Intelligent Control and Systems
	¥	Telesurgery
	¥	Virtual Reality in Medicine
	¥	Approach to Clinical Trials and Cost/Benefit Analyses
	¥	Technology Assessment and the Benefits (and Costs) to Society
	¥	Current Applications of Medical Robotics Systems
	¥  	Live Surgery
