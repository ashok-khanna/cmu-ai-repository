		SIGAda Artificial Intelligence WG Meeting
		    at the Washington Ada Symposium
			 McClean Hilton, Virginia
			  June 27-July 1, 1994

AIWG 1-day Workshop (June 27, 1994)
-------------------
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together software researchers and
practitioners from real-time and AI communities to exchange ideas, results,
and lessons learned, addressing the unique set of problems brought about by
the integration of Artificial Intelligence into conventional embedded systems. 

	|----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | With the dynamic growth of the field of Artificial Intelligence and
        | the tremendous progress in hardware technology it seems inevitable
        | that AI components will soon, if not already, play a major role in
        | real-time embedded applications. Embedded AI refers to the use of
        | knowledge-based techniques in larger systems in such a way as to
  WHY?  | enable new functionality and improved mission results as a whole.
	| Designers of these AI embedded applications also face the same
	| problems and challenges as traditional software engineers. These are
	| compounded by the nature of AI algorithms and AI support tools.
	|----------------------------------------------------------------------

	|----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Although these next generation embedded systems possess some unique
	| special purpose requirements (for example, intelligent behavior such
	| as introspection, self-monitoring and self-description), they must be
  WHAT?	| integrated with existing software performing conventional real-time
	| tasks.  This introduces new conceptual and engineering problems into
	| traditional AI including (emphasis will be placed on software
	| engineering and language issues):  
	|
	| Systems design and integration
	|    AI problems (applications) and their solutions within the
	|	framework of embedded real-time systems 
	|    integration approaches to incorporate knowledge-based
	|	technology with conventional, complex, large software systems 
	| Real-time AI computing
	|    algorithms (e.g., performance within real-time constraints) 
	|    theory (e.g., reasoning with dynamically changing data) 
 TOPICS	| Software Engineering issues
	|    scaling up (from prototypes to full-scale deployed systems) 
	|    difficulties with requirements analysis and with design methods
	|	which adequately encompass rapid prototyping and V&V 
	|    compliance with standard practice
	| Language issues
	|    adequacy of traditional AI languages (specially CommonLisp) 
	|    adequacy of software engineering languages (specially Ada)
	|----------------------------------------------------------------------

	| Submit a position paper (2-3 pages) on any of the subjects listed
	| above, or related topic, by May 15, 1994. Authors will be notified
	| of acceptance  by May 31, 1994 and will be given instructions for
 	| final preparation of their papers/presentations at that time.
