          CALL FOR PAPERS

          GENETIC PROGRAMMING TRACK

          June 26 (Sunday) to June 26 (Wednesday), 1994
          Walt Disney World Dolphin Hotel
          Lake Buena Vista, Florida

          At the IEEE CONFERENCE ON
          EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION

          As part of the IEEE WORLD CONGRESS ON 
          COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

          Sponsored by the IEEE Neural Networks Council

Papers are being solicited for a 3-day Genetic Programming track at the
IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Compuation.   The  IEEE Conference on
Evolutionary Compuation will be held as part of the larger and longer
IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence sponsored by the IEEE
Neural Networks Council to be held from June 26 (Sunday) to July 2
(Saturday), 1994.  The multi-conference will include the 1994 IEEE
Conference on Neural Networks and the FUZZ/IEEE '94 conference as well
as numerous tutorials on genetic programming, genetic algorithms,
evolutionary computation, neural networks, and fuzzy logic.

Topics: 
Theoretical and applied aspects of genetic programming, 
Tierra, and other systems for evolving computer programs.

               INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

Papers must be received in San Diego by: 

		Friday December 10, 1993.  

All accepted papers will be published in the Conference Proceedings.
Papers will be reviewed by senior researchers in the field, and all
authors will be informed of the decisions at the end of the review
proces.   Six copies (one original and five copies) of the paper must
be submitted.  Original must be camera ready, on 8.5 x 11-inch white
paper, one-column format in Times or similar fontstyle, 10 points or
larger with one-inch margins on all four sides.  Do not fold or staple
the original camera-ready copy.  Four pages are encouraged.  The paper
must not exceed six pages including figures, tables, and references,
and should be written in English.  Centered at the top of the first
page should be the complete title, author name(s), affiliation(s) and
physical mailing address(es), and electronic mailing address(es) if
available.

In the accompanying letter, the following information must be included:

	1) Full title of paper, 
	2) Corresponding author's name, physical address, telephone,
	   electronic mail address (if available), and fax numbers,
	3) First and second choices of technical session (specify
	   "GENETIC PROGRAMMING" here), 
	4) Preference for oral or poster presentation, and 
	5) Presenter's name, physical address, electronic mail address
	   (if available), telephone and fax numbers.
