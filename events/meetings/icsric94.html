        ICSRIC94 AI SYMPOSIUM - FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

 7th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on SYSTEMS RESEARCH INFORMATICS AND CYBERNETICS

                              August 15-21, 1994
                      Convention Centre - Congresshouse
                            Baden-Baden, Germany

                               Sponsored by:

                      The International Institute for
            Advanced Studies in Systems Research and Cybernetics
                                 and
                    Society for Applied Systems Research

The Conference provides an international forum for the presentation and
discussion of short reports on current systems research in humanities,
sciences and engineering.  A number of specialized symposia are held within
the Conference to focus on research in computer science, linguistics,
cognitive science, psycho-cybernetics, synergetics, logic, philosophy,
management, education and related areas.

The aim of the conference is to encourage and facilitate the interdisciplinary
and trans-disciplinary communication and cooperation amongst scientists,
engineers, and professionals working in different fields, and to identify and
develop those areas of research that will most benefit from such a
cooperation.

                           AI Symposium     

The 1994 conference will place particular emphasis on Artificial Intelligence.
Topics in this Symposium will include, but are not limited to, the following:
Knowledge representation, Reasoning, Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Neural
Networks, Expert Systems, User Models, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and
Development Methodologies.  Papers dealing with theoretical issues or with
applications are solicited.  In addition to paper presentations, panel
sessions on several of these topics are planned.

Participants who wish to present a paper are requested to submit a 500 word
abstract as soon as possible, but not later than March 15, 1994.  (E-mail
submissions are preferred.)  Notification of acceptance will be sent to
authors by April 30, 1994.  Full papers, not exceeding 5 single-spaced typed
