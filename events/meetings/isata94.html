International Symposium on Automotive Technology and Automation

Aachen, Germany, 31st October - 4th November 1994


CALL FOR PAPERS

INTERNATIONAL DEDICATED CONFERENCE ON
MECHATRONICS - THE USE OF ELECTRONICS FOR PRODUCT
DESIGN, TESTING, ENGINEERING & RELIABILITY


Programme Committee Chairmen: Professor D Roller, Universitat
Stuttgart & Dr D Zetsche, Deputy Member of the Board of Management
for Passenger Car Development, Mercedes-Benz AG, Germany

Continuously faster changing market requirements place a strong emphasis
on new technologies for the automotive industry.  The Mechatronics
conference is dedicated to enhanced methods and new techniques for the
design and production of the increasingly complex mechanical and
electrical components and systems in vehicles.  A series of
mini-conferences will address new research results in the following
particular domains:

*     Quality and Testing - including reliability methods, noise and
      vibration testing
*     Control Systems - including emission, transmission, suspension
      steering and braking control
*     Sensors & Communications Systems - including multiplexing and
      in-vehicle networking
*     Advanced Ergonomics - including speech input and output, display
      systems
*     Innovative Software Solutions - including artificial
      intelligence, fuzzy logic, automatic vision systems
*     Prodcut Modelling - including variational design, integrated data
      models, simultaneous    engineering, rapid prototyping and product
      information management
*     The Development of Braking Systems within the Automotive
      Industries
*     Virtual Reality

Papers are invited on all of the above and related topics

Final Date for Abstracts:     14th April 1994
