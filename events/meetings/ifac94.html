                      2nd IFAC Workshop on
                 Computer Software Structures
                  Integrating AI/KBS Systems

                       AUGUST 10-12, 1994

                         LUND, SWEDEN 



                        Organized by

                Department of Automatic Control

  T Hagglund, Lund Institute of Technology
  C. Rytoft, Asea Brown Boveri AB
  B. Wittenmark, Lund Institute of Technology 
  

Scope:

  The aim of the workshop is to inform about
 
   - where the leading edge is in the integration of 
     AI/KBS systems in real time process control 
   - what the primary challenges are to future 
     advances
   - how computer science, process control, and 
     related technologies can contribute to these 
     advances.

  The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge-based
  systems (KBS) has created a strong interest in applying these
  technologies to process control.  The workshop will focus on solutions
  that meet the needs of real-time operations, data synchronization, and
  execution speed while satisfying control systems functionality and
  integration constraints.

  New practical and theoretical avenues (in architectures, languages,
  executives) that provide a basis for effective coexistence of, and
  execution of, real time and knowledge-based modules in modern process
  control systems are among the topics of interest.


Topics:

   - The role of AI/KBS systems in the supervision, management, and
     control of industrial processes.

   - Software architectures and languages for joint applications of
     expert systems and process control algorithms, possibly high
     performance and time-critical.

   - Synchronous communication and real time needs in control
     systems incorporating AI/KBS.

   - Object-oriented structures. AI/KBS versus traditional software
     systems in process control.

   - Issues in hardware and software integration.

   - Software techniques that accommodate changes in process
     configuration. 

   - Issues in knowledge acquisition and representation for
     process control.

   - Augmenting human decision making.

   - The hardware technology base for integrated systems. Neural
     networks and other new avenues.

   - Management issues (cost & economy, implementation, project
     management).

   - Process control applications of real time expert systems,
     neural networks, and fuzzy logic.


Key dates:

  Submission of draft papers      January 15, 1994
  Notification of acceptance        March 15, 1994
  Submission of full papers          June  1, 1994

  The Workshop language is English. All submissions must be written in
  English. Send three copies of the draft papers (max. 6 pages, double columns)

Location:

  The Workshop will take place in the  Palaestra building in the 
  university area in the center of the old university town Lund. 
  Lund is located in the southern part of Sweden and has good
  international flight connections via Copenhagen and/or Malmo.
  An exhibition will be arranged in connection with the Workshop.

  Only unpublished papers may be submitted. IFAC holds the copyright for
  publication of the papers. Accepted papers will appear in the
  Preprints and will be considered for possible publication in the IFAC
  Journals Automatica or Control Engineering Practice
  published by Pergamon Press. A paper will be released for
  (re)publication three months after the symposium unless the author has
  been notified that the paper is being considered for publication in
  either of the IFAC Journals. The abstract of all presented papers will
  be published in the IFAC Journal Control Engineering Practice.

  Copyright of articles are transferred to IFAC on presentation at the 
  meeting. Permission to republish material presented at the meeting
