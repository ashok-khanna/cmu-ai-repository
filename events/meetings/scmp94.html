     SYMPOSIUM ON CONNECTIONIST MODELS AND PSYCHOLOGY

                University of Queensland
                  Brisbane  Australia

               Saturday,  29 January 1994
(back-to-back with the Australian Conference on Neural Networks)


The symposium is aimed at psychologists and psychological modelers,
specifically those who are studying or questioning the relevance of
neural networks to experimental psych.  We are aiming to provide a
structured forum for discussion of issues. The symposium is structured
into three sessions, focussed on the following themes:

TENTATIVE PROGRAMME (8.10.93)

SESSION  1.  The rationale for psychologists using models:  What
benefits (if any) are there to be gained from using neural nets and
other computational devices as models of human perception and cognition?

Chair:  Peter Slezak
Target Address:   Danny Latimer
Discussants:  Max Coltheart; Sally Andrews; Margaret Charles

SESSION 2.  Correspondence between human and network performance:  What
methods and measures are available for comparing network variables and
human experimental data?

Chair:  Danny Latimer
Speakers:  Kate Stevens; Graeme Halford; Simon Dennis

SESSION 3.  Basic computational processes:  Psychological theories of
cognition assume the operation of basic processes such as comparison,
storage, search etc.  What do the connectionist and symbol-manipulating
approaches provide as means for modeling these processes?

Chair:  Steve Schwartz
Target Address:   Janet Wiles
Discussants:  Mike Johnson; Zoltan Schreter; George Oliphant

For the first and third sessions the role of the speaker is to raise
issues and, possibly, defend a position. The reviewers will provide
a commentary on the issues raised by the target speaker.  For the
second session, the role of the speakers is to raise and discuss
conceptual and empirical issues.  In all sessions the chair will lead
the discussion.

We're aiming to circulate a pre-proceedings two weeks in advance
of the symposium to registered participants.
