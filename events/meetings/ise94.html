INTRODUCTION

   Following the highly successful First International Conference on
Intelligent Systems Engineering, held in Edinburgh during August 1992, the
second Conference (ISE 94) will be held at the Technical University of Hamburg-
Harburg in Germany, during 5-8th September 1994. The aim of the conference is
to provide a forum for reporting significant results on the theory and
application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to Engineering problems. The
conference will contribute to bridging the gap between artificial intelligence 
and the various engineering disciplines, and should show how these fields can
be combined to build Intelligent Systems for Engineering. An exhibition showing
recent developments and demonstrations of the results of EC funded research
projects is planned. The Conference is in association with the Journal,
Intelligent Systems Engineering.

SCOPE

   We seek to publish original contributions to the Principals, Techniques and 
Applications of Intelligent Systems in Engineering.  Contributions to
Principals may include theoretical analysis of the properties or methodological
issues in the specification or application of such systems.  Papes on Tools and
Techniques should describe the development or extension of Al-based methods and
their implementation.  Such papers should also discuss the assumptions and
limitations associated with the proposed methods.  Application papers should
describe a significant implementation of Intelligent Systems to an Engineering
problem, and should be supported by adequate experimental results to allow 
the evaluation of the approach.

   The scope of the conference can be taken as the full range of Engineering 
applications.  We group these into four categories:

1.      Reasoning
   (a)     Qualitative Modelling and Simulation
   (b)     Causal Reasoning
   (c)     Uncertain and Fuzzy Reasoning
   (d)     Non-Monotonic Reasoning
   (e)     Temporal Reasoning
   (f)     Case-Based Reasoning
   (g)     Functional Reasoning
   (h)     Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms
   (i)     Time-Constrained Reasoning
   (j)     Learning Automata
   (k)     Combined Analytical Modelling and Knowledge Representation



2.      Architectures
   (a)     Expert Systems
   (b)     Model-Based Systems
   (c)     Multiple-Model Systems
   (d)     Artificial Neural Networks
   (e)     Distributed Knowledge Based Systems
   (f)     Hetereogeneous Systems
   (g)     Architectures for Intelligent Systems
   (h)     Real-Time Systems

3.      Development Tools
   (a)     Knowledge Acquisition 
   (b)     Knowledge Refinement
   (c)     Knowledge Validation and Evaluation
   (d)     Model Building Tools
   (e)     User Interfaces
   (f)     Methodological Approaches

4.      Applications
   (a)     Fuzzy and Intelligent Control
   (b)     Classification by Neural Networks
   (c)     Process Monitoring and Supervision
   (d)     Fault Detection and Diagnosis
   (e)     Industrial Training Systems
   (f)     Production Planning and Scheduling
   (g)     Image and Speech Understanding
   (h)     Real-Time Al-Based Systems
   (i)     Intelligent Computer-Aided Design
   (j)     Intelligent Robotics
   (k)     Automonous Vehicles

CONTRIBUTIONS

   Full papers should be submitted to the IEE Conference Services Department
on or before 25th February 1994.  Papers should not exceed 5000 words.
Authors are requested to classify their proposed contribution using the
categories given in the Scope.  Papers must be original and must not have been
published before; authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a
copyright transfer form.  All papers will be carefully reviewed by at least 
two internationally respected referees.  Accepted papers will be published in
the Conference Proceedings by the IEE.  Contributions that are considered to be
significant may be invited to submit extended versions of the paper to the
Journal, Intelligent System Engineering.

SCHEDULE


Receipt of full papers for consideration        25 February '94
Notification of acceptance                              May '94
Receipt of camera-ready manuscript                     June '94
