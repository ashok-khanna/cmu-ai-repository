Subject: 4th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing - Call for Papers

			CALL FOR PAPERS
       4th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing
 			Stuttgart, Germany
			October 13-15, 1994
 
 			 sponsored by
 	    Association for Computational Linguistics
 

PURPOSE
 Like previous ACL Applied conferences, this meeting will bring
 together researchers and developers from around the world to focus on
 the application of natural language processing to real problems.  The
 program will include invited and contributed papers, an industrial
 exhibition, and demonstrations.  This year's conference will aim
 especially to promote participation from both industry and academia
 and to feature work with potential business impact.
 
AREAS OF INTEREST 
 Original papers are solicited in all areas of applied natural language 
 processing, including but not limited to: dialog systems; integrated 
 speech and natural language systems; machine translation; explanation 
 and generation; database interface systems; tool development; text 
 and message processing; automated document management; grammar and 
 style checking; corpus development; knowledge acquisition; lexicons; 
 language teaching aids; evaluation; adaptive systems; multilanguage 
 systems; multimedia systems; help systems; and other applications.  
 Papers may discuss applications, evaluations, limitations, and general
 tools and techniques.  Papers that critically evaluate an approach or 
 language processing strategy are especially welcome.
 
REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION  
 Authors should submit, by 2 May 1994, a) six copies of a
 full-length paper (min 9, max 15 double-spaced pages, minimum font
 size 12, exclusive of references); and b) 16 copies of a 20-30 line
 abstract. A paper accepted for presentation at the meeting cannot
 be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly
 available published proceedings. Papers that are being submitted to
 other conferences must reflect this fact on the title page.
 Papers arriving after the deadline will be returned unopened.  FAX 
 papers will not be reviewed; however, electronic submissions will be 
 allowed using the same guidelines as the 1994 ACL conference.

 Papers should be submitted to the Program Chair:

	Paul Jacobs (ANLP-94)
	Institute for Research in Cognitive Science
	3401 Walnut St., Suite 400C, Rm. 420
	Philadelphia, PA 19104-6228		+1-215-898-0332
	pjacobs@unagi.cis.upenn.edu	 	+1-215-573-2048 fax
 
 Electronic submissions should be either self-contained LaTeX source or
 plain text.  Submissions should include the words ``ANLP-94 submission''
 in the subject field. LaTeX submissions must use the ACL submission style
 (aclsub.sty) retrievable from the ACL LISTSERV server (access to which
 is described below) and should not refer to any external files or
 styles except for the standard styles for TeX 3.14 and LaTeX 2.09. A
 model submission modelsub.tex is also provided in the archive, as well
 as a bibliography style acl.bst.  (Note that the bibliography for a 
 submission cannot be submitted as separate .bib file; the bibliography 
 entries must be inserted in the submitted LaTeX source file.)

 Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by 5 July
 1994. Full-length versions of accepted papers, prepared according
 to instructions, must be received, along with a signed copyright
 release statement, by 22 August 1994.

 All papers will be reviewed by members of the program committee, which 
 includes the Program Chair and the following individuals:

 Susan Armstrong, ISSCO			Peter Norvig, Sun Microsystems
 Harry Bunt, Tilburg University		Hans Joachim Novak, IBM 
 Jim Cowie, NMSU/CRL			Martha Palmer, Univ. of Penn. 
 Ido Dagan, AT&T Bell Labs		Manny Rayner, SRI 
 Robert Ingria, BBN			Donia Scott, Univ. of Brighton 
 Richard Kittredge, Univ. of Montreal   Oliviero Stock, IRST 
 Kazunori Muraki, NEC			Annie Zaenen, Xerox 

VIDEOTAPES
 Videotapes are sought that display interesting research on NLP
 applications to real-world problems, even if presented as promotional
 videos (not advertisements).  An ongoing video presentation will be
 organized that will demonstrate the current level of usefulness of
 NLP tools and techniques.
 
 Authors should submit one copy of a videotape of at most 15 minutes
 duration, accompanied by a submission letter giving permission to
 copy the tape to a standard format and two copies of a one to two
 page abstract that includes: title, name and address and email or fax
 number of authors; tape format of the submitted tape (VHS, any of
 NTSC, PAL or SECAM); duration.  Tape submissions should be sent to 
 the same address as the papers (see above).  The timetable for 
 submissions, notification of acceptance or rejection, and receipt of 
 final versions is the same as for the papers.  See above for details.

DEMONSTRATIONS
 In addition to demonstrations carried on within a regular booth at the 
 industrial exhibition, there will be a program of demonstrations on 
 standard equipment available at the conference (SUN's, MAC's, etc.).
 Prizes may be awarded to the best industrial and non-industrial demos. 
 Anyone wishing to present a demo should send a one-page demo description 
 and a specification of the system requirements by 20 June 1994 to:

	Uwe Reyle 
        Institut f"ur Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung
        Universit"at Stuttgart
        Azenbergstr. 12

        Germany				+49-711-1211366 fax
        reyle@ims.uni-stuttgart.de

TUTORIALS, WORKSHOPS AND INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION
 The conference will have facilities for a variety of special events,
 including tutorials and workshops before the conference, and an 
 industrial exhibition during the conference. Proposals for workshops, 
 and inquiries about the industrial exhibition, should be sent to Uwe 
 Reyle at the  address above. Persons wishing to arrange an exhibit 
 should send a brief description with a specification of physical 
 requirements (space, power, telephone connections, etc.) by 2 May 1994.

 Tutorials will be coordinated by:

GENERAL INFORMATION
 Local arrangements are co-chaired by Uwe Reyle and Christian Rohrer.
 For information regarding facilities and local arrangements, contact
 Uwe Reyle at the above adress.

ACL LISTSERV
 LISTSERV is a facility to allow access to an electronic
 document archive by electronic mail. The ACL LISTSERV has been set up
 at Columbia University's Department of Computer Science. Requests from
 the archive should be sent as e-mail messages to

	listserv@cs.columbia.edu

 with an empty subject field and the message body containing the
 request command. The most useful requests are "help" for general help
 on using LISTSERV, "index acl-l" for the current contents of the ACL
 archive and "get acl-l <file>" to get a particular file named <file>
 from the archive. For example, to get an ACL membership form, a
 message with the following body should be sent:

	get acl-l membership-form.txt

 Answers to requests are returned by e-mail. Since the server may have
 many requests for different archives to process, requests are queued
 up and may take a while (say, overnight) to be fulfilled.

 The ACL archive can also be accessed by anonymous FTP. Here is an
 example of how to get the same file by FTP (user typein is underlined):

	$ ftp cs.columbia.edu
	  -------------------
	Name (cs.columbia.edu:pereira): anonymous
                                        ---------
	Password:pereira@research.att.com << not echoed
                 ------------------------
	ftp> cd acl-l
	     --------
	ftp> get membership-form.txt.Z
             -------------------------
	ftp> quit
             ----
	$ uncompress membership-form.txt.Z
          --------------------------------
