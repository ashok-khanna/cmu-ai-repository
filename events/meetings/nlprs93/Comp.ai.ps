Natural Language Processing Pacific Rim Symposium '93 (NLPRS '93) is
the second Pacific Rim regional symposium on natural language
processing for researchers from all over the Pacific Rim countries
(and additionally from all over the world.)  The purpose of the
symposium is to promote research of the highest caliber in natural
language processing and to promote scientific interchange among
researchers and practitioners in the area.

The symposium is sponsored by the Special Interest Group on Natural
Language Processing (SIGNLP) of Information Processing Society of
Japan (IPSJ) and jointly sponsored by Fukuoka Institute of Technology
which is a university of Japan.  The SIGNLP has organized Natural
Language Processing Pacific Rim Symposium '91 (NLPRS '91) on November,
1991 at Singapore.  The SIGNLP will again offer another ideal venue to
present state-of-art research and to share ideas by organizing NLPRS
'93.  It will invite all people who have interest in the symposium.

                 Travel and Accommodation Information

  Natural Language Processing Pacific Rim Symposium '93   (NLPRS '93)

Fukuoka-city: Fukuoka city is the largest city in Kyushu of Japan and
its population is one million.  Fukuoka city is located at the most
North part of Kyushu where is one thousand kilometer west from Tokyo.

Transportation to Fukuoka: There are 27 non-stop flights from Tokyo
domestic airport (Haneda) everyday.  It takes one and half hours.
There are many flights from other Japanese big and small cities.
There are direct international flights from Asia and Pacific.  Also
there are direct JR (Japan Rail) Shinkansen train services from Tokyo.
It takes five hours.

Fukuoka International Airport: It has three terminals; Terminal 1 and
2 are for domestic flights and Terminal 3 is for international
flights.  The subway station is located at Terminal 2.  Japanese big
air-carriers are JAL (Japan Air Lines), ANA (All Nippon Airways), and
JAS (Japan Air Systems).

JR Hakata railway terminal: It is located at five minutes by subway
from Fukuoka International Airport.  It has a big building from which
Shinkansen, Trunk-lines, Local-lines and Subway depart.  There are a
big department store and many shops.  Beside it there is a big bus
terminal named Hakata Transportation Center.

Fukuoka downtown: Tenjin is the name of the Fukuoka downtown and is
located at several minutes by subway from JR Hakata railway terminal.
Tenjin is also called as Fukuoka sometimes.  There is a railway
terminal (Fukuoka Station) and bus terminal (Fukuoka Bus Center or
Tenjin Bus Center - double named).  The railway terminal is for
NishiTetsu railway services and the bus terminal is for NishiTeshu bus
services.  There are many big shops both on and under the ground.

Accommodation: I recommend you to book a hotel around JR Hakata
railway terminal.  Alternatives are to book a hotel around Tenjin.
For the convenience of overseas participants, I can help you to book a
hotel if you let me know the check-in and check-out dates and room
grade you prefer as well as full information on credit card name,
number, and expiration date.  The room charge is about 7,000 or 8,000
yen for a night at the cheapest rate at a business hotel.

Fukuoka Institute of Technology: You take a JR train on JR
Kagoshima-line from JR Hakata railway terminal.  You can buy your
ticket by a machine: put in money and then push a button indicating
the fare.  You must get on an ordinal train but never Shinkansen,
Express train, nor Rapid train.  You get off the train at
Chikuzen-Shingu station.  It takes about 20 minutes.  Chikuzen-Shingu
station is a small station.  After getting off the train, you must be
careful.  In the morning and late afternoon they open a temporal exit
at the opposite side of the usual exit for the convenience of students
going to Fukuoka Institute of Technology and the subsidiary college
and high school.  Thus you must ask if you was confused.  To the
temporal exit you must cross over the railway through a bridge.  If
you could get to the opposite side, then you can find a very very
small exit.  At the outside of the exit you turn to the right and walk
several minutes along a small road which is slightly ascending, then
you can find university buildings on the left side.  If you could not
get out from the temporal exit unfortunately, you get out from the
usual exit and turn to the left and walk for a bridge crossing over
the railway to the university.  Do not worry about even when you lost
your way to the university, your only task is to resolve the problem
by simply speaking aloud "University" or "DAIGAKU (in Japanese)" then
any Japanese would be so kind to tell you how to get University i.e. 
Fukuoka Institute of Technology However, please remind a fact that
there are universities at every railway stations thus you must be
careful to tell the exact name of the university.  Japanese name of
Fukuoka Institute of Technology is "Fukuoka Kougyo Daigaku."  Good
luck!

Weather: The beginning of December is clear up and slightly cool.
Average temperature is 14 degree in highest and 4 degree in lowest.
Some Japanese people wear an overcoat.  We never have snow in the
beginning of December.

Amusement: Space World is in Kita-Kyushu-city whose population is also
one million and located at East of Fukuoka (one hour by train).  The
biggest stadium in Japan is located at Fukuoka city which is for
professional baseball games and other entertainments.  There is a
famous big shrine named Dazaifu in Fukuoka-city (take a NishiTetsu
train from Tenjin station.).
