                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                         Workshop at ECOOP '94

    Artificial Intelligence for Object-Oriented Software Engineering

                Tuesday, July 5, 1994, Bologna, Italy


Motivation:
    AI has contributed to OO.  For example, frames for knowledge
    representation have contributed to the object notion.
    Classification of concepts helped to develop the notion of
    inheritance.  Moreover, software engineering has been an
    enduring interest in the AI community ranging from program
    verification, automatic programming up to the development
    of programming assistants.  Therefore, the application of AI
    technology especially to OO software engineering is very promising.

    This workshop will provide a forum to discuss open questions, to
    present work done, and to establish future collaborations and
    mutual insemination.  Every useful contribution to apply AI
    technology to object-oriented software engineering is welcome.

Objective:
    The objective of this workshop is to strengthen the bridges between
    AI and OO.  In particular, we want to foster impact from AI onto OO
    software engineering.

    The workshop is intended to support the following purposes:
    - to provide an overview of academic and industrial activities
    - to serve as a discussion panel for the coordination of these
      efforts
    - to identify research topics of common interest
    - to identify industrially applicable results of current research
    - to establish a network of people and organizations interested
      in these questions.

Theme(s):
    We invite contributions, among others, on the following topics:

    Knowledge acquisition and elicitation techniques for OOA

    Knowledge representation
    -   for capturing OO analysis, design and code artifacts
        (and their traceability links) to support retrieval
        and/or reasoning about these artifacts
    -   for capturing domain models and other results of
        OO domain analysis
    -   capturing macro and micro development processes in
        order to assist developers in an unobtrusive fashion
    -   for dealing with quality requirements on classes/objects

    (Semi-)automatic support based on AI techniques for
    -   constructing designs from OOA specs
    -   constructing low level designs from high level OO designs
    -   programs from low level OO designs
    -   the verification of
        .    a high level design against OO analysis specifications
        .    transformations of high level OO designs into
             low level designs

    User interfaces:
    -   natural language processing for assisting requirements
        specification, use case development, automatic artifact
        descriptions, etc.
    -   visual development of OO software systems based on knowledge
        repositories

    Formal descriptions for
    -   the definition of OO features
        (inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding, ...)
    -   extensions of pre- and post-condition formalisms to
        represent the semantics of asynchronous one-way
        interactions and/or object creation and deletion

    Case-based reasoning for identifying frameworks and class libraries

    Model-based reasoning for diagnosing software bugs

The final content of the workshop will depend on the contributions. We
are aiming at both the presentation of academic results applicable to
practical problems and the identification of practical challenges
needing further research.

Addressees:
    Practitioners in OO SE,
    senior fellows in AI both from industry and academia,
    students interested in application of AI techniques to OO SE

Schedule:
    Deadline for submission:                        May 1, 1994
    Notification of acceptance or rejection:        June 1, 1994
    Deadline for final version of position papers:  June 19, 1994

Agenda:
    This workshop will be full-day. The first half day will be used
    to communicate the work of selected participants in short presentations.
    The second half day will be dedicated to small groups discussing
    topics of special interest, and the presentation of their key results
    to the other participants. An open discussion will conclude the
    workshop.

Attendance and Submissions:
    Every prospective attendee is required to submit a 1-2 page research
    summary including a list of relevant publications, regular and email
    address (where possible), and voice and fax phone numbers.
    Participants who wish to present their work are additionally required
    to submit a short paper (3-5 pages).
    Please send submissions preferably via e-mail (ASCII or PostScript) to
    all of the organizers, or send three copies to A. Schappert (in Europe)
    or to D. de Champeaux (in the US).
    Participation at the workshop is by invitation only, based on the
    submission. It will be for free, but each workshop attendee must have
    registered for the main ECOOP conference.
