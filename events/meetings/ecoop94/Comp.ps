                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                         Workshop at ECOOP '94

    Artificial Intelligence for Object-Oriented Software Engineering

                Tuesday, July 5, 1994, Bologna, Italy


Motivation:
    AI has contributed to OO.  For example, frames for knowledge
    representation have contributed to the object notion.
    Classification of concepts helped to develop the notion of
    inheritance.  Moreover, software engineering has been an 
    enduring interest in the AI community ranging from program
    verification, automatic programming up to the development
    of programming assistants.  Therefore, the application of AI
    technology especially to OO software engineering is very promising.

    This workshop will provide a forum to discuss open questions, to
    present work done, and to establish future collaborations and 
    mutual insemination.  Every useful contribution to apply AI 
    technology to object-oriented software engineering is welcome.

Objective:
    The objective of this workshop is to strengthen the bridges between 
    AI and OO.  In particular, we want to foster impact from AI onto OO
    software engineering.
    
    The workshop is intended to support the following purposes:
    - to provide an overview of academic and industrial activities
    - to serve as a discussion panel for the coordination of these 
      efforts
    - to identify research topics of common interest
    - to identify industrially applicable results of current research 
    - to establish a network of people and organizations interested
      in these questions.

Theme(s):
    We invite contributions, among others, on the following topics:

    Knowledge acquisition and elicitation techniques for OOA
    
    Knowledge representation
    -   for capturing OO analysis, design and code artifacts 
        (and their traceability links) to support retrieval 
        and/or reasoning about these artifacts
    -   for capturing domain models and other results of
        OO domain analysis
    -   capturing macro and micro development processes in 
        order to assist developers in an unobtrusive fashion
    -   for dealing with quality requirements on classes/objects

    (Semi-)automatic support based on AI techniques for
    -   constructing designs from OOA specs
    -   constructing low level designs from high level OO designs
    -   programs from low level OO designs
    -   the verification of
        .    a high level design against OO analysis specifications
        .    transformations of high level OO designs into 
             low level designs

    User interfaces:
    -   natural language processing for assisting requirements
        specification, use case development, automatic artifact 
        descriptions, etc.
    -   visual development of OO software systems based on knowledge
        repositories 

    Formal descriptions for
    -   the definition of OO features 
        (inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic binding, ...)
    -   extensions of pre- and post-condition formalisms to
        represent the semantics of asynchronous one-way
        interactions and/or object creation and deletion

    Case-based reasoning for identifying frameworks and class libraries

    Model-based reasoning for diagnosing software bugs

The final content of the workshop will depend on the contributions. We
are aiming at both the presentation of academic results applicable to
practical problems and the identification of practical challenges
needing further research.

Addressees:
    Practitioners in OO SE, 
    senior fellows in AI both from industry and academia,
    students interested in application of AI techniques to OO SE

Schedule:
    Deadline for submission:                        May 1, 1994
    Notification of acceptance or rejection:        June 1, 1994
    Deadline for final version of position papers:  June 19, 1994    

Agenda:
    This workshop will be full-day. The first half day will be used
    to communicate the work of selected participants in short presentations.
    The second half day will be dedicated to small groups discussing
    topics of special interest, and the presentation of their key results
    to the other participants. An open discussion will conclude the
    workshop.

Attendance and Submissions:

Call for Participation - Half Day Workshop 

Common Elements for Object-Oriented Programming Systems 

Tuesday afternoon, July 5, 1994 

in conjunction with ECOOP '94, Bologna, July 4-8, 1994 

Motivation 
In many areas of computer science the object model has been accepted as a solid
foundation for building information processing systems. Object orientation has 
been and still is a hot research topic in areas such as operating systems, 
distributed systems, data base systems, programming languages, CASE, 
network management, artificial intelligence, multi-media, goupware, etc. 
Although the object model is accepted widely, the actual research and 
development still takes place in a rather isolated fashion. There is little 
"inter-operability" between disciplines. Each discipline typically has its 
own emphasis and set of requirements as to what issues, properties, 
effects, aims, etc. are most important. We need to identify the common 
elements and to discuss how these elements can be integrated into appropriate 
infrastructures. 

Theme 
We look at the common substrate of architectural structure and functionality 
that is needed in all object-based / object-oriented information processing 
systems. Among the issues that arise here are inter-operability, persistence, 
factories, browsers, object sharing, concistency, recovery, transactional 
behaviour, testing, security, etc. First attempts are being made to define 
common substrates, e.g. by the Object Mangagement Group. These attempts are 
focussed on a particular area, e.g. OMG aims at interoperability in 
heterogeneous distributed systems. We need to view the substrate in a broader 
perspective - a perspective that includes established research 
areas as well as new technological challenges. 

Objectives 
The main objective of the workshop is to foster the exchange of viewpoints 
and ideas between participants about the common requirements of object systems. This should lead to a better understanding of what is needed to design, 
build and operate such systems. It is important to discuss it now while so 
many projects and activities are being started in the realm of object 
technology. Experience in the past has shown that the lack of interdisciplinary
exchange leads to redundancy, inefficiency, and most important to 
non-compatible solutions. The results of the workshop will be summarized 
in a report, which may - depending on its technical substance - be 
submitted for publication. 

Participation 
The workshop addresses researchers and developers in all computer science
areas that work on object systems. Participants will be selected based on 
written position statements. The length of a position statement may range 
from 2 - 10 pages. Submission via e-mail is preferred. Authors should enclose 
with their contribution a short statement on their background and experience 
in respect to object technology. All presentations at the workshop will be 
15 minutes with additional time for discussion. Please remember that 
primarily the workshop is meant to be a forum for discussion! 

Organisation 
This half-day workshop is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, July 5, 
14:00 - 17:30. The number of participants is limited to approximately 
30 due to room constraints.

			   Call for Papers

			  One day Workshop:

		  USE OF OBJECT-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGY
		  FOR NETWORK DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT

		    in conjunction with ECOOP'94,
			     4-8 july, 1994
			    Bologna, Italy





Telecommunications networks are complex dynamic structures whose
design and management require advanced software development methods
and techniques, very likely to benefit from OO technology.  Concerning
network design, some interesting experiments have been carried out in
that direction.  Furthermore, OO recommendations and standards are
currently under discussion for telecommunications management networks (TMN).

The purpose of this workshop is therefore to bring together people who
have carried out _advanced_ OO applications in that domain, in order to
have a survey of the existing realisations or experiments, and try to
give an insight into future research.

The workshop is also intended to be a challenge to evaluate the
advantages and disadvantages of OO technology for the areas of network
design and management, and more precisely its ability to bridge the
gap between different activities of a same domain (e.g. for
telecommunications networks: network modelling vs. algorithms
implementation, network design vs. network management, ...).

Telecommunications networks are more particularly concerned, but
practitioners and researchers from other areas (electricity,
transport, ...) are welcomed, as long as their work is not specific
their domain.

Many OO topics may be relevant to networks, we give below
a list that is not limitative:

    o  object-based knowledge representation (reflection, constraints,
       relations, viewpoints, classification, ...);
    o  OO recommendations for network management (TMN, OSI, ...);
    o  OO analysis, specification and design;
    o  OO implementation of design algorithms (network sizing, configuration,
       graph theory, ...);
    o  concurrent and/or distributed OO implementations;
    o  OO and distributed databases;
    o  OO interactive and graphical interfaces (network manipulation,
       animation, visualisation, ...);
    o  OO simulation.


PARTICIPATION

Participants will be selected on the basis of either a short position
paper (1 or 2 pages for regular participation without presentation),
or of a long paper (up to 10 pages, for presentation at the
workshop). Long papers must describe significant research studies or
applications, and should discuss the benefit of the use of
object-oriented technology.

Submissions should be made preferably by electronic mail (LaTeX,
Postscript, and MIF formats will be accepted) to the chairman; by
surface mail 4 paper copies should be sent. The deadline for
submitting papers is April 14th, 1994.  An acknowledgement of
reception will be sent by e-mail or by fax to the author.  The first
page of the paper should include the name, address, telephone and fax
number, and e-mail address of the author.  Notification of acceptance
will be mailed or faxed by June 3rd, 1994.  Minor modifications to the
papers may be asked at that stage, and in that case a definitive paper
should be sent before June 17th, 1994.
