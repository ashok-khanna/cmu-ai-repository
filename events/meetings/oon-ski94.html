Theme:  OON-SKI provides a forum where computer scientists and
scientific programmers can discuss how to use object-oriented
programming techniques to more effectively write complex scientific
codes.

There will be four separate areas of focus:

    *  Object-Oriented Environments:  Design, Development, and
                       Debugging Tools
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      Fully realizing the benefits of OOP requires more than just an
      OO language - it requires a complete environment for design,
      development, debugging, and profiling.  Papers submitted to
      this area will describe components of such an environment as
      they relate to numerics. Submissions on handling parallelism,
      and how to achieve the efficiency necessary for numerics, are
      particularly welcome.

    *  Object-Oriented Analysis and Design Methodologies
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       How do you go about designing a numerical object-oriented
       application?  There are several object-oriented methodologies
       in existence, ranging from the unstructured whiteboard
       discussion approach to formal Booch diagrams.  Are these
       methods for numerical programming?  We invite papers
       discussing tools and ideas on this subject and also outlining
       your own experience.

    *  Object-Oriented Software Components & Class Libraries
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       Choosing the correct abstractions so that objects can be used
       in diverse applications is very difficult.  In this section, we
       invite papers describing libraries of numerical classes
       designed explicitly for diverse uses.  Especially interesting
       (and educational) would be tales of success:  accounts of real
       code with a diverse user base.

    *  Applications
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       Is it easier to construct numerical applications using object-
       oriented programming?  How robust are the resulting programs
       compared to their procedural counterparts?  How fast are they?
       How much memory do they use?  In the final analysis, the
       answers to these questions will determine the success or
       failure of object-oriented numerics.  In this section we would
       like to hear your experiences with object-oriented codes and
       how these questions (and others you can think of) would be
       answered.

                      PANEL DISCUSSION PROPOSALS
                      --------------------------
Panel proposals should include the title, a brief description of the
objectives and issues to be covered, the panel chair and probable
panelists (including short vitae).  Panels will be selected according
to their substance and contributions to the conference program.
Panel submissions are due by December 15, 1993.

                         AUTHOR INFORMATION
                         ------------------
Authors should submit 8 copies of an extended abstract (via smail
mail) by December 15, 1993.  A cover page should be attached which
includes the following:

    * Name, affiliation, and complete address for each author
    * A designated contact person including his/her telephone number,
      fax number, and e-mail address (if available).
    * A designated presenter should the paper be accepted.
    * Title of submission

                        NOTIFICATION
                        ------------
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection on January 17,
1994.  Camera ready copies of full papers will be due on March 15,
1994 and should be 1 1/2 spaced, 11 point font, 1" margins, and 5,000
words or less.
