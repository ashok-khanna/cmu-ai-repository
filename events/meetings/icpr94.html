                       CALL FOR PAPERS - 12th ICPR
              International Conferences on Pattern Recognition
                     Oct 9-13, 1994, Jerusalem, Israel

The 12th ICPR of the International Association for Pattern Recognition will be
organized as a set of four conferences, each dealing with a special topic. The
program for each individual conference will be organized by its own Program
Committee. Papers describing applications are encouraged, and will be reviewed
by a special Applications Committee. An award will be given for the best
industry-related paper presented at the conference. Considerations for this
award will include innovative applications, robust performance, and
contributions to industrial progress. An exhibition will also be held.
The conference proceedings are published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

balanced technical program.  Combined with the inspiring location at 
Jerusalem, we are certain that the 12th ICPR will be a rewarding and
memorable experience.
