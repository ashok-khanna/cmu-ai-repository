                First Announcement and Call for Papers
       International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation
                              ISSAC '94

         20 - 22 July 1994, St. Catherine's College, Oxford, UK
           General Chair : Malcolm MacCallum, QMW, London, UK
    Program Chair : Joachim von zur Gathen, University of Toronto, Canada

The annual International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation
(ISSAC), sponsored (subject to confirmation) by the ACM Special Interest Group
in Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SIGSAM), will be held in the University
city of Oxford (England) from Wednesday, 20 July, to Friday, 22 July 1994, with
preliminary registration on Tuesday evening (19 July). Papers presenting
original research on all areas of symbolic and algebraic computation are sought.
Typical, but not exclusive, topics of interest include: algorithms for problems
in algebra, number theory, group theory, algebraic  geometry, differential
algebra and differential equations; combined symbolic/numeric methods; languages
and systems for symbolic computation; parallel symbolic computation; automatic
theorem proving and programming; applications of symbolic computation to
mathematics, science, engineering and education.

Paper Submission: Papers may be submitted either electronically in LaTeX form
using a standard article style or (preferred) as Postscript files, or in hard
copy form. The preferred format is 12pt, with a maximum of 10 pages. Authors may
also use the ACM-style macros available via anonymous ftp from
wally.cs.mcgill.ca in the file pub/doc/tex/acmconf.sty, in which case the page
limit is 5 pages.  Any paper submitted electronically must be transmitted as one
complete file (no shell archive etc.); papers which cannot be processed by
standard LaTeX with the appropriate style macros will be rejected. In case of
hard copy, authors are requested to provide 6 copies of their paper (printed
both sides, if possible). Authors whose access to reproduction facilities is
severely limited may submit a single copy of their paper. Papers must be
received by  15 January 1994 by the Program Chair or postmarked not later than 8
January 1994 and sent by airmail.  This is a firm deadline.  Later submissions
risk rejection without consideration of merit, as do papers that are longer than
the page limit as above.  To make submissions as intelligible as possible to
non-specialists, they should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, an explanation of their significance, and a comparison with
previous work. Submissions should include the contact author's name, address,
telephone/fax number and e-mail address if possible.  Simultaneous submission of
essentially the same paper to another conference with published proceedings is
not allowed.

Notification: Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by a
communication sent by  25 March 1994. The provisional date for receipt of the
final copy of the paper is 20 April 1994. (At this stage LaTeX form is strongly
preferred, as it will simplify production.)  Authors of accepted papers will be
expected to confirm their intention to present their work at the Symposium.

Local Arrangements: The local arrangements committee consists of James Davenport
(Bath), Exhibits/Sponsorship Chair, and Steve Hague (NAG),  Local Chair, and
other colleagues.  Exhibitions and demonstrations will take place during the
Symposium, and an "accompanying partners" program will be arranged. For further
