Research in the field of user modeling and user-adapted interaction
provides crucial foundations for improving the usability of interactive
software systems and technical devices in many application areas. UM-94,
the Fourth International Conference on User Modeling, will offer a forum
for presenting the results of academic and industrial research in  this
field to an international audience. Whereas UM-86, UM-90 and UM-92 were
invitational workshops, UM-94 will be a conference with open
participation. Much of the original character will be preserved, however,
by holding the meeting in a workshop-like setting, with ample room for
presentations, special interest group meetings and system demonstrations.

Submissions are invited on original and substantial academic or
industrial research on all aspects of user modeling and user-adapted
interaction, including (but not limited to) the following topic areas:
user model acquisition, plan and intent recognition, user stereotypes,
representation of user models, inference, consistency of user models,
user modeling shell systems, explanation generation, intelligent/adaptive
user interfaces, intelligent tutoring systems, navigational aids,
adaptive hypertext and hypermedia, information retrieval and information
filtering, knowledge-based information presentation, natural-language
systems, and applications in office machines and consumer electronics.

Accepted submissions will be published in a proceedings volume. Extended
versions of high-quality papers should be submitted to the international
journal User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction after the conference.

UM 94

Hyannis, Massachusetts and Cape Cod


Location

"The southernmost tip of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stretches
approximately 100 miles out into the Atlantic Ocean.  This wonderful
peninsula is known as Cape Cod: the northside shore opens to the cool
waters of Massachusetts Bay while the southern beaches reach to the
warm and gentle waters of Nantucket Sound.  Centrally situated is the
town of Barnstable with shorefront on both north and south coasts."

"Within the town of Barnstable are seven villages: Barnstable, West
Barnstable, Marstons Mills, Cotuit, Osterville, Centerville and
Hyannis.  The largest and most central is the village of Hyannis - the
Hub of the Cape: terminus for island ferries, major bus
transportation, and airlines.  The Islands of Nantucket and Martha's
Vineyard lie to the east and southeast of the mainland."

History

"The history of Hyannis and the Town of Barnstable is rich and
colorful, from the first explorer to yesterday."

"In 1602, Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold was the first of the Old World
explorers to view the area known as Hyannis."

"In 1620, the Pilgrims stopped in Hyannisport but were deterred from
settling here permanently because of the extremely low tides and
treacherous rocky harbor.  However, settlers from Barnstable, England
did incorporate the town of Barnstable in 1639."

"The early settlers of the town of Barnstable were primarily farmers
who turned toward the sea.  The maritime harvest was plentiful, for
frequently there were drift whales on our beaches.  By the close of
the 19th century over 800 shipmasters sailed worldwide for the
homeport of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  Many of these brave mariners
established strong family ties in our area and their descendents are
still vital, well-known members of our community today."

"City dwellers had begun to appreciate the pleasures of summer
vacations spent by the edge of the sea.  In 1872, the Hyannis Land
Company purchased nearly 1,000 acres extending from Lewis Bay to
Craigville, including most of Hyannisport, for about $100.  Thus began
the ever expanding tourist industry radiating from Hyannis."

"Among the earliest nationally known personalities to enjoy the
Hyannis area was President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874.  Some years later
President Grover Cleveland visited Hyannisport.  During the 1960's the
eyes of the world focused on Hyannis when native son John F. Kennedy
ascended to the Presidency of the United States."

Hyannis, The Hub of the Cape

"Hyannis is the largest of Barnstable's seven principal villages and
is within one day's drive of one third of the population of the United
States, with 6 million people entering and leaving Hyannis year
round."

"Hyannis is the Cape's commercial and transportation hub."

"Known as Cape Cod's urban center, Hyannis boasts the area's largest
concentration of businesses, shops, motels, hotels, restaurants and
entertainment spots.  Located mid-Cape, 40 miles from Plymouth and 50
miles from Provincetown, Hyannis is the perfect 'take off' point for
exciting side trips."

"Downtown you'll find Main Street: from east end to west end, a
variety of specialty shops, factory outlets and eateries to dazzle the
eye and palate.  Midway along Main Street be sure to enter the Old
Town Hall for a tour of the JFK Museum, the Cape Years, an exhibit
which highlights the special aura Cape Cod offered to President
Kennedy."

"Within pleasant walking distance of Main Street is Hyannis Harbor.
At the intersection of South and Ocean Streets, you will see the newly
refurbished Aseiton Park, the beginning of the proposed scenic Walkway
to the Sea.  As you travel this route, enjoy the ambiance of the dock
area of Hyannis Harbor at Bismore Park.  There, awaiting visitors, are
the ferries for the islands of Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard, as well
as excursion and charter boats for daily fishing trips, catboat and
windjammer scenic cruises of the harbor and replica steamboats to
carry passengers on frequent sightseeing tours.  Beyond the harbor
area is the JFK Memorial Park on Ocean Street overlooking Veteran's
Beach.  Continue along Ocean Street to Kalmus Beach which boasts
shoreline on both Hyannis Harbor and Lewis Bay.  The village of
Hyannis also offers the Orrin Keyes beach on Sea Street for additional
sunning, swimming, shelling, and strolling."

"For a different water vista and activity enjoy the flavor of
whale-watching cruises from Barnstable Harbor on the north side of the
Cape, or from Provincetown."

UM 94
                YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED TO THE

        Fourth International Conference on User Modeling
             Hyannis, Cape Cod, Massachusetts U.S.A.
                       15 - 19 August 1994



Research in the field of user modeling and user-adapted
interaction provides crucial foundations for improving the
usability of interactive software systems and technical devices
in many application areas.  UM-94, the Fourth International
Conference on User Modeling, will offer a forum for presenting
the results of academic and industrial research in this field to
an international audience.  The conference will gather
international researchers in User Modeling from a broad spectrum
of interdisciplinary fields.  Whereas UM-86, UM-90 and UM-92 were
invitational workshops, UM-94 will be a conference with open
participation.  Much of the original character will be preserved,
however, by holding the meeting in a workshop-like setting, with
ample room for presentations, special interest group meetings and
system demonstrations.

Enclosed in this package are a Tentative Program Schedule, the Call
for Papers, Registration and Accommodations forms, along with
information about activities happening in and around the Cape Cod
Area. There is a bus service that will be operating to and from Logan
International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, for which schedules will
be made available closer to the conference date.  We believe that
attendees will find the conference facilities superb, and the
atmosphere of Cape Cod in the summer time outstanding.

will offer a forum for presenting the results of academic and
industrial research in this field to an international
audience. Whereas UM-86, UM-90 and UM-92 were invitational workshops,
UM-94 will be a conference with open participation.  Much of the
original character will be preserved, however, by holding the meeting
in a workshop-like setting, with ample room for presentations, special
interest group meetings and system demonstrations.

Submissions are invited on original and substantial academic or
industrial research on all aspects of user modeling and user-adapted
interaction, including (but not limited to) the following topic areas:
user model acquisition, plan and intent recognition, user stereotypes,

Hyannis, Massachusetts and Cape Cod


Location

"The southernmost tip of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stretches
approximately 100 miles out into the Atlantic Ocean.  This wonderful
peninsula is known as Cape Cod: the northside shore opens to the cool
waters of Massachusetts Bay while the southern beaches reach to the
warm and gentle waters of Nantucket Sound.  Centrally situated is the
town of Barnstable with shorefront on both north and south coasts."

"Within the town of Barnstable are seven villages: Barnstable, West
Barnstable, Marstons Mills, Cotuit, Osterville, Centerville and
Hyannis.  The largest and most central is the village of Hyannis - the
Hub of the Cape: terminus for island ferries, major bus
transportation, and airlines.  The Islands of Nantucket and Martha's
Vineyard lie to the east and southeast of the mainland."

History

"The history of Hyannis and the Town of Barnstable is rich and
colorful, from the first explorer to yesterday."

"In 1602, Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold was the first of the Old World
explorers to view the area known as Hyannis."

"In 1620, the Pilgrims stopped in Hyannisport but were deterred from
settling here permanently because of the extremely low tides and
treacherous rocky harbor.  However, settlers from Barnstable, England
did incorporate the town of Barnstable in 1639."

"The early settlers of the town of Barnstable were primarily farmers
who turned toward the sea.  The maritime harvest was plentiful, for
frequently there were drift whales on our beaches.  By the close of
the 19th century over 800 shipmasters sailed worldwide for the
homeport of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  Many of these brave mariners
established strong family ties in our area and their descendents are
still vital, well-known members of our community today."

"City dwellers had begun to appreciate the pleasures of summer
vacations spent by the edge of the sea.  In 1872, the Hyannis Land
Company purchased nearly 1,000 acres extending from Lewis Bay to
Craigville, including most of Hyannisport, for about $100.  Thus began
the ever expanding tourist industry radiating from Hyannis."

"Among the earliest nationally known personalities to enjoy the
Hyannis area was President Ulysses S. Grant in 1874.  Some years later
President Grover Cleveland visited Hyannisport.  During the 1960's the
eyes of the world focused on Hyannis when native son John F. Kennedy
ascended to the Presidency of the United States."

Hyannis, The Hub of the Cape

"Hyannis is the largest of Barnstable's seven principal villages and
is within one day's drive of one third of the population of the United
States, with 6 million people entering and leaving Hyannis year
round."

"Hyannis is the Cape's commercial and transportation hub."

"Known as Cape Cod's urban center, Hyannis boasts the area's largest
concentration of businesses, shops, motels, hotels, restaurants and
entertainment spots.  Located mid-Cape, 40 miles from Plymouth and 50
miles from Provincetown, Hyannis is the perfect 'take off' point for
exciting side trips."

"Downtown you'll find Main Street: from east end to west end, a
variety of specialty shops, factory outlets and eateries to dazzle the
eye and palate.  Midway along Main Street be sure to enter the Old
Town Hall for a tour of the JFK Museum, the Cape Years, an exhibit
which highlights the special aura Cape Cod offered to President
Kennedy."

"Within pleasant walking distance of Main Street is Hyannis Harbor.
At the intersection of South and Ocean Streets, you will see the newly
refurbished Aseiton Park, the beginning of the proposed scenic Walkway
to the Sea.  As you travel this route, enjoy the ambiance of the dock
area of Hyannis Harbor at Bismore Park.  There, awaiting visitors, are
the ferries for the islands of Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard, as well
as excursion and charter boats for daily fishing trips, catboat and
windjammer scenic cruises of the harbor and replica steamboats to
carry passengers on frequent sightseeing tours.  Beyond the harbor
area is the JFK Memorial Park on Ocean Street overlooking Veteran's
Beach.  Continue along Ocean Street to Kalmus Beach which boasts
shoreline on both Hyannis Harbor and Lewis Bay.  The village of
Hyannis also offers the Orrin Keyes beach on Sea Street for additional
sunning, swimming, shelling, and strolling."

"For a different water vista and activity enjoy the flavor of
whale-watching cruises from Barnstable Harbor on the north side of the
Cape, or from Provincetown."

ABSTRACTS FOR INVITED TALKS

Cognitive Tutors:  Lessons Learned        John Anderson
                                          Carnegie-Mellon University

This talk reviews the ten year history of tutor development based on
the ACT theory (Anderson, 1983, 1993).  LISP, geometry, and algebra
tutors were developed on the principle that students should be
instructed by making reference to a running production system model
that was solving the same problems as the students.  A set of eight
principles loosely based on the ACT theory and cognitive psychology
were articulated for fashioning interactions with these tutors.  Early
evaluations usually but not always showed significant achievement
gains.  Best case evaluations showed that students could achieve at
least the same level of proficiency as conventional instruction in
one-third of the time.  Empirical studies showed that students were
learning skills in production-rule units and that the best tutorial
interaction style was one in which the tutor provides immediate
feedback, consisting of short and directed error messages.  The tutors
appear to work better if they present themselves to students as non
human tools to assist learning rather than as emulations of human
tutors.  The learning that students do appears somewhat specific to
the problem-solving interface and they display transfer to other
environments to the degree that they can map the tutor environment
into the test environment.  These experiences have coalesced into a
new system for developing and deploying tutors.  This system involves
first selecting a problem-solving interface, then constructing a
curriculum under the guidance of a domain expert, then designing a
cognitive model for solving problems in that environment, then
building instruction around the productions in that model, and finally
deploying the tutor in the classroom.  New tutors are being built in
this system to achieve the NCTM standards for high school mathematics
in an urban setting.


Lies, Damned Lies and Stereotypes:        Judy Kay
Pragmatic Approximations of Users         University of Sydney

Programmer's stereotypes of their users are built into most software.
Current research in hci, especially usability, has a large emphasis on
defining effective stereotype models of relevant user populations.
The promise of user modelling comes from making user models explicit
and then, on the basis of a range of models, systems can offer greater
flexibility in adaptation to different users.  One of the most
important notions for building such models is that of stereotypes.
They are a pervasive element of much work in user modelling.  They are
especially important as powerful, statistically accurate models of
groups of users.  This talk deals with the ways that stereotypes have
been used, both in user modelling research and, by other names, in
many other areas.  In fact, they are so pervasive that I argue user
modelling is already a large industry.  From this, I develop several
essential bases for the effective use of stereotypes to build
collections of tools that will operate in such diversified areas as
information filtering, help systems, advisors and the tailoring of
information presentation.  To achieve this, there are many issues that
will need attention and these constitute a research agenda for
deploying stereotypes.  This includes technical issues like the
representation and acquisition of stereotypes and matching individuals
to them.  There are also socio-policitical issues: as we tackle the
technical problems, we need to be cognisant of these.  I will discuss
some of these, including the user's right of real access,
understanding and control of the way that the user modelling in
systems works.  The talk describes projects that have been developing
toolkits for the various technical components of the tasks.  These
include extensive and diversified approaches to building the
stereotypes, determining which to apply to individual users and
exploiting them in individualising the user's interaction with the
machine.  Also, mindful of the lies that are inherent in the
approximation that a stereotype must be, I discuss tools and
approaches to attending to the socio-policitical concerns.


Toward Personalized Multimedia            Wolfgang Wahlster
                                          German Research Center for
                                          Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)

The concept of tailoring multimedia presentations to the user can be
seen as an extended version of the view concept known from database
technology.  The quest for adaptation is based on the fact that it is
impossible to anticipate the needs and requirements of each potential
user in an infinite number of presentation situations. In our PPP
project, we "personalize" a multimedia presentation system in two
senses of the word : On the one hand, PPP makes a presentation
personal by tailoring it to a specific user. On the other hand, we
personify the presentation system and the user model as a virtual
presentation agent, which appears as an animated character and
highlights, comments on, and explains the generated multimodal
presentation. During a presentation the user can address the
presentation agent to complain about the current style of presentation
or about incorrect assumptions in PPP's user model. The use of the
presentation agent means that PPP must be able to plan and temporally
coordinate multimodal presentations and multimedia presentation acts.

                      Adaptive hypertext and hypermedia

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

Hypertext/hypermedia systems and user-model-based adaptive systems
(i.e.  intelligent tutoring systems, information retrieval systems)
are most often considered as two different approaches to browsing
information spaces and interface organisation. Adaptive hypertext and
hypermedia systems (AHS) attempt to bridge the gap between the two
extremes. AHS enhance classic hypermedia with an intelligent agent
which supports a user in her work with hypermedia. The intelligent
agent can adapt the content of a hypermedia page to the user's
knowledge and goals or suggest the most relevant links to follow. AHS
avoid the `unrelevant adaptation' problem of classic adaptive systems
by providing space for user-driven adaptation.  AHS also avoid the
`lost in hyperspace' problem of classic hypermedia systems by
providing intelligent guidance.

The goal of the workshop is to exchange the experience on the
development of adaptive hypermedia systems and to discuss several
important problems centered around adaptive hypermedia.

Participation
-------------

...is open to everybody agreeing to contribute in one the following ways:

   * prepare a short paper (3-4 pages) presenting the experience of
     development and/or application of adaptive hypertext/hypermedia
     system (the presentation of ongoing work is encouraged)

   * prepare a position paper (2-3 pages) on one or more of the proposed
     workshop topics

   * suggest a new topic related with adaptive hypermedia and prepare a
     position paper on this topic
                     
Suggested topics
----------------

1. Do we really need adaptive hypermedia systems? Opponents hold that
   the very idea of hypermedia is that different users can adapt the
   hypermedia based system to their needs, while the system itself has to
   be static.

2. What can be adapted in adative hypermedia. Several ways of adaptive
   presentation support and adaptive navigation support are expected to be
   discussed

3. How the hypermedia can be adapted. What types of user models and what
   adaptation techniques can be used.

4. How to combine adaptive hypermedia with the more traditional use of
   hypermedia for human-driven adaptation.

5. How to apply AHS to some traditional application areas as
   intelligent tutoring systems, information retrieval systems, on-line
   help systems.
                                                         
6. Architectures for adaptive hypermedia systems. How such systems can be
   integrated with other user-model-based systems (i.e. ITS).

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

The workshop will have a round-table format. Its duration will be 4
hours.  Several presentations based on the accepted papers will be
given. The workshop starts with presentations of several implemented
adaptive hypermedia systems followed by position papers presentation.
The presentations are intended to act as catalysts for discussion of
various problems related with adaptive hypermedia.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should
be directed to the workshop organizers.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Submit a position papers or short work report of 2-4 pages. Send
submissions in plain ascii format to the organizers: plb@plb.icsti.su
and beaumont@ibmt.fhg.de . Authors whose papers are accepted will be
requested to prepare 10-20 minute presentations of their work. Authors
of short work report papers are welcome to send a copy of their
previous publications on adaptive hypermedia related with the topic of
their papers. The accepted papers will not be included into the
conference proceedings. However, conference organizers will ensure
that a sufficient number of copies of all accepted papers will be
available for the workshop.

                Applied Planning and Plan Recognition

MEETING TOPIC

This SIG meeting is intended to bring together researchers in the
field of planning and plan recognition as user modelling techniques,
to discuss the practical use of their work. Issues in focus are:

- novel application areas, 
- requirements on knowledge representation in particular applications, 
- knowledge acquisition (and machine learning) methods, 
- usability and user acceptance of systems exploiting planning or plan
recognition.

The workshop will consist of a small number of presentations
interleaved with in-depth discussions. Papers reporting practical
experiences are particularly encouraged, although position papers also
are welcome.

NOTIFICATION OF PARTICIPATION AND SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Participants should notify the organisers of their intention to
participate in the workshop no later than July 15th.

Participants that wish to make a presentation should submit a three
(3) page abstract of their subject together with their notification of
participation. Abstracts should be submitted preferably by email in
postcript or text form. Hard-copy submissions are also acceptable.

The number of presentations at the workshop will be strictly limited
in order to promote discussions rather than talks. Thus, authors of
some accepted abstracts may not be able to present their work.
However, all accepted abstracts will be included in the workshop
proceedings.

                           DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

Motivation
----------

The idea of offering Doctoral Consortiums at major conferences is becoming
more popular. A number of conferences are offering them this year,
including HCI '94: People and Computers, and OOPSLA '94. This is a
tremendous opportunity for graduate students in User Modeling,
particularly those who are at institutions where there is not a great deal
of active User Modeling research. Students will benefit in several
different ways; primarily by presenting work to a knowledgable audience,
but other benefits include meeting established researchers and other
graduate students doing similar work. This Doctoral Consortium will be
especially timely since, for the first time, the UM-94 conference will
have open participation. 

Suggested Topics
----------------

In much the same way that the research done in User Modeling spans several
different domains, graduate research may cover a wide range of topics but
should contribute to some aspect of user modeling and user-adapted
interaction. The conference Call for Participation includes a
comprehensive list of possible topics. 

Format of the Consortium
------------------------

Advanced doctoral students are invited to apply to the consortium to
present their research to scholars and researchers in the field who will
provide constructive comments about their work. Students are expected to
have completed their proposals and be able to document in a brief
submission the thesis topic, the approach to be taken and the amount of
work that has already been completed, if any. A small number of applicants
will be chosen by the consortium committee and invited to present their
work in a short presentation. This presentation may include a
demonstration if appropriate. After the presentation the committee members
will informally comment on the student's work. The consortium will be
three hours in length, from 2:30-5:30 pm on Wednesday, August 17, 1994. 

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Students who are interested in participating should submit a two page 
abstract of their doctoral research in plain ascii format to:
     strachan@cs.umanitoba.ca
All students whose submissions have been accepted will be expected to 
present their research in a 15 minute presentation. A maximum of 6 
submissions will be accepted.

Researchers who are interested in participating as part of the committee
are requested to provide an electronic submission indicating their
willingness to participate and their general field of research by the July
3, 1994 Deadline for Submissions. Committee members will be responsible
for selecting the students based on their submissions and providing the
informal feedback based on the presentations at the consortium. 

Important Dates
---------------

July 3    1994    Deadline for Submissions
July 15   1994    Notification of Acceptance

   The Empirical Evaluation of User Models and Adaptive Systems

Although considerable work has been done using empirical data to
construct user models, there has been less empirical support for the
resulting models' usefulness.  If elaborate user models and other
adaptive techniques are to become part of real-world systems, it must
be demonstrated that they can extend and improve those systems.  This
Workshop will provide an opportunity for those interested in this
important topic to share their ideas and experience.  The Workshop
will consist of short position papers, brief reports of empirical
studies and discussion.  It should serve as a forum for identifying
components of user models and adaptive systems requiring empirical
investigation, presenting methodological proposals for how such
investigations might be conducted, identifying areas in which work is
being done and where work is still needed, presenting short reports
describing the findings from empirical studies, and finally,
identifying advantages, disadvantages and limitations of such studies.
Discussion of issues and sharing of ideas are key to a successful
Workshop, and as much time as possible will be provided for
interaction among the participants.

Submissions of position papers and brief reports are invited, including
work-in-progress.

SIG Workshop Format:
---------------------------

The Workshop will be be limited to 3 hours and will be held on Wednesday, 
August 17 from 2:30-5:30.  The time available should allow for up to five 
brief reports and position papers.  The presentations are intended to
focus 
discussion and stimulate a lively exchange of ideas on the topic.  Some 
attempt will be made at the end of the Workshop to summarize the issues
and 
direction of this area.

Attendance at the Workshop
----------------------------------

Attendance at the workshop will include those individuals who have 
submitted papers or reports.  The Workshop will also be open to those who 
have been active in the area or who intend to work in the area in future.

Submissions
---------------

Submit a position paper or a short work report of between 2-4 pages. 
Authors 
whose papers are accepted will be requested to prepare a 10-15 minute 
presentation.  The total time allowed for presentation and discussion
will be 
30 minutes.

Send your submissions in ASCII format to aim@dretor.dciem.dnd.ca.  
Electronic submission is preferred, but if that is not possible, you may
either 
fax a copy to my attention at (416) 486-6013, or send a copy to Dr. Jack 
Edwards at the address below.

The papers and reports presented at the Workshop will not be published in

            The relationship between user and task models

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

Task models are an important source of information for adaptive and/or
adaptable systems. They contain information about the necessary tools,
the participating objects, etc. From such task descriptions, for
example, competence models can be derived. However, there is evidence
that the design of of most prototypical adaptive systems is not
explicitly based on task modeling. The workshop tries to identify the
difficulties of employing task models as an information source and to
work out possible approaches to overcome these difficulties.

Submissions of position papers or short work reports are invited.
Topics include, but are not limited to:

   * task modeling and plan recognition
   * intelligent user support based on task models
   * extension of task models (task induction, evaluation) and
     its relationship to machine learning
   * user-adapted presentation of task models
   * acquisition of task knowledge
   * representation of task knowledge

The presentation of ongoing work is encouraged.

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

The workshop will have a round-table format. Up to five presentations
based on
the accepted papers will be given. Its duration will be 3 hours. The 
presentations are intended to act as catalysts for discussion which can
and
should go beyond the presentations themselves.

Attendance
----------

Attendance at the workshop will be restricted to persons whose
position paper or work report has been accepted.  Participants should
register for both the workshop and the general conference.  For those
who do not register for the general conference a small amount
(probably $50) will be charged to cover miscellaneous expenses and a
snack break.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should
be directed to the workshop organizer.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Submit a position papers or short work report of 2-5 pages. Authors whose
papers
are accepted will be requested to prepare an informal 5-10 minute
presentation 
of their work.

Send submissions in plain ascii or Latex source format to
gerhard@faw.uni-ulm.de, or mail 3 copies of hardcopy submissions to
Gerhard Peter at the address below. Electronic submissions are preferred.
Please do not send floppy disks or tapes.

Important Dates
---------------

July 15    1994  Deadline for submissions
July 20    1994  Notification of acceptance

Publication
-----------

The accepted papers will not be included into the conference proceedings.
However,
conference organizers will care that a sufficient number of copies of all
accepted
papers will be available for the workshop.

THE ROLE OF USER MODELING IN KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND KNOWLEDGE
REPRESENTATION

The purposes of user modeling are several. For the cognitive
scientist, an improved understanding of user behavior helps flesh our
the cognitive model of problem solving.  This, of course, has
implications for knowledge representation and human-computer
interaction.  For the applications developer, the contextual
anticipation of user skills and needs incresases the likelihood that
the user will deem the software to be usable, useful, and worthy using
after the novelty wears off.  User modeling can also allow software to
grow over time.  In short, the concept of user modeling holds
significant pomise for a wide range of research and development
activities in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and software
development.

User modeling also presents significant challenges, particulaely when
the application domain is complex.  Even under the assumptions that
(a) it suffices to "extract" knowledge from a single domain expert,
and (b) such an expert is available, several issues remain.  In
addition, one needs more than an expert to interview as a user - a
range of users from novice on up is needed.

First, who is going to sit at the keyboard; i.e., the direct user?
The amount and kind of intervention, constraint checking, and advice
depends on several factors, including the nature of the problem to be
solved, the stage of solution, and the skill level of the problem
solver.  For example, one might expect the needs and behaviors of a
domain novice to differ substantially from those of a domain expert.
Those needs may also vary depending on how well-defined the problem
is, or how complete or satisfactory the solution is.  This has
implications for the knowledge acquisition process itself, as well as
for how the knowledge acquired is used in the application system to
add user modeling enhanced capabilities.

Second, despite the availability of a human expert, that person's
relevant "compiled" knowledge may be inaccessible outside of his or
her work environment.  Knowledge acquisition is complex and one must
take into account the environment and people who are being queried.
For example, reasonably "chunked" problems used in laboratory settings
may be too pristine to provide a natural incentive for the problem
solver to ignore the knowledge acquisition task, of which he/she is
the focus, and delve into the problem.  Similarly, the expert's deep
knowledge and behaviors may remain submerged because the selected
problem is not real; i.e., there are no consequences of a bad or
simplistic solution.  The resulting user model may be aimed at a
fictitious ideal user.  Under such circumstances, the real user may
either perform inadequately or feel inadequately served.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore methods for research and
development of large knowledge-based systems, in domains in which
expertise is difficult to access.  The specific focus is on the
central role that user modeling can play in (a) the knowledge
acquisition/software development process, (b) the development of
successful human-computer interfaces, and (c) the underlying knowledge
representation that connects the two.

           Standardization of User Modeling Shell Systems

One can expect that user modeling shell systems will play an increasingly
important role in the next few years. It therefore seems advisable to
standardize the interface between applications and user modeling shells,
and possibly also aspects of user modeling shell systems that are already
scientifically established. The standardization of the interface will
allow
programmers of adaptable and adaptive application systems 
 (a) to clearly define the boundary between the application and the user 
     modeling components, 
 (b) to delay the selection of a user modeling shell until the user
modeling
     needs of the application are clearly defined, and 
 (c) to switch to a different user modeling shell when the user modeling
needs
     of the application increase or decrease, or when a new shell system
with
     the same functionality becomes available that is preferable for other
     reasons. 
The standardization of scientifically established aspects of user modeling
shell systems would include:
(a) Standardization of the functionality of a user modeling system:
    application programmers would profit if there were a basic minimal
    functionality that all user modeling systems would fulfill;
(b) Standardization of the user modeling terminology: application
    programmers (and also scientists) would profit if common terminology
    would be employed in the description of user modeling shell systems.

The aim of this SIG meeting is to explore the needs for standardization in
cooperation between shell developers and application-directed researchers,
and to fix a priority list and (if possible) a time-table for future work.
Participants should give short presentations that include position
statements, work reports, or proposals regarding the topic of the
workshop.
Written summaries of not more than 2-4 pages in plain ascii format should
be sent to the organizer: kobsa@inf-wiss.uni-konstanz.de. The accepted
papers will be distributed among the workshop participants.

             USER MODELING IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS

MOTIVATION
      Adaptive systems for Information Retrieval (IR) are become
increasingly
important with the growth and availability of data-bases and
Hypermedia. More and more users who are unfamiliar with the system
and/or domain have access to IR systems and face difficulties in
formulating good queries. The need of adaptive IR systems that can
help the user search for information has been recently recognised by
industry and this field promises to become one of a great commercial
interest in the near future.
      Adaptivity of software can be obtained by modelling the users and
tailoring the system's interactions to their goals/tasks/interests.
There are a lot of general issues concerning User Modeling in IR.
So far, however, little or no integration of work on UM in IR has
been done, in order to compare and evaluate the general problems and
approaches in this field. The goal of the SIG Meeting is to
discuss the issues of User Modeling in IR - to help create a
picture of the state of the art, to exchange experience and to find the
promising tendencies in the field.

SUGGESTED TOPICS
The SIG discussion will be focused on identifying the common and
specifics of User Modelling (UM) in systems for Information Retrieval
(IR). The discussion will center around the following questions:

1. In what ways can adaptivity help the user of an IR system? How much
adaptivity and adaptability is desirable in an IR context? How to
support optimally collaborative and individual work?

2. What sorts of information does the user model need to enable these
types of adaptation and adaptability?

3. How can the User Model acquire this information?

4. How can this information best be represented internally and
processed? How can general UM approaches be applied and compared in
the context of different types of applications?

5. What knowledge acquisition techniques can be used for UM in IR (for
example, in defining user-groups, user-interests, user-tasks)? What
degree of co-operation from the users can be expected? Is it possible
to create methodologies for UM in certain types of applications?

6. What types of applications are currently of interest for industry?
What practical limitations exist?

PARTICIPATION
The goal of the meeting is to carry out a DISCUSSION rather than
another paper-presentation session. Therefore, participants are encouraged
to share their ideas about the provided topics around which the
discussion will focus. Of course, if anyone would like to propose a
new topic, (s)he shouldn't hesitate to do so! Every potential participant
can contribute to the discussion in one of the following ways:
        (1) prepare statements on one or several of the listed topics.
Each
statement should be not longer than 1 page. It would be very good, if
the participant's own work with respect to the given topic is addressed,
however this is not required. Provocative statements are welcome!
        (2) propose a new topic of discussion and provide a 1-page
motivation for doing so and a statement on this topic.
        (3) prepare a short presentation-summary (max. 3 pages) of
their own experience in the field, but in a way that it explicitly
addresses some of the mentioned topics or poses new ones.

FORMAT OF THE SIG MEETING
The SIG meeting will take about 3 hours. The discussion will be moderated
in a way to show different, hopefully conflicting viewpoints in a dynamic
way. All participants will have the chance to present their ideas in 5 to
10 minutes, long self-contained presentations will not be tolerated.  An
attempt to summarise and draw conclusions from the discussion will be
made finally.

SUBMISSION
Submissions are expected in one of the three types (1), (2) or (3). They
should
be sent in plain ASCII text format or in RTF (file interchange format) to
                          jiv@informatik.unibw-muenchen.de
Write subject of the message "SIG submission".
Authors are also welcome to send copies of their papers, if they think
this
will help to explain with more details their position statements or
presentations.
For this they can use the postal address below.

The accepted statements and presentations will not be published in the
conference proceedings. However, copies will be made available together
with
protocols of the discussion after the SIG meeting.

                      Adaptive hypertext and hypermedia

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

Hypertext/hypermedia systems and user-model-based adaptive systems
(i.e.  intelligent tutoring systems, information retrieval systems)
are most often considered as two different approaches to browsing
information spaces and interface organisation. Adaptive hypertext and
hypermedia systems (AHS) attempt to bridge the gap between the two
extremes. AHS enhance classic hypermedia with an intelligent agent
which supports a user in her work with hypermedia. The intelligent
agent can adapt the content of a hypermedia page to the user's
knowledge and goals or suggest the most relevant links to follow. AHS
avoid the `unrelevant adaptation' problem of classic adaptive systems
by providing space for user-driven adaptation.  AHS also avoid the
`lost in hyperspace' problem of classic hypermedia systems by
providing intelligent guidance.

The goal of the workshop is to exchange the experience on the
development of adaptive hypermedia systems and to discuss several
important problems centered around adaptive hypermedia.

Participation
-------------

...is open to everybody agreeing to contribute in one the following ways:

   * prepare a short paper (3-4 pages) presenting the experience of
     development and/or application of adaptive hypertext/hypermedia
     system (the presentation of ongoing work is encouraged)

   * prepare a position paper (2-3 pages) on one or more of the proposed
     workshop topics

   * suggest a new topic related with adaptive hypermedia and prepare a
     position paper on this topic

Suggested topics
----------------

1. Do we really need adaptive hypermedia systems? Opponents hold that
   the very idea of hypermedia is that different users can adapt the
   hypermedia based system to their needs, while the system itself has to
   be static.

2. What can be adapted in adative hypermedia. Several ways of adaptive
   presentation support and adaptive navigation support are expected to be
   discussed

3. How the hypermedia can be adapted. What types of user models and what
   adaptation techniques can be used.

4. How to combine adaptive hypermedia with the more traditional use of
   hypermedia for human-driven adaptation.

5. How to apply AHS to some traditional application areas as
   intelligent tutoring systems, information retrieval systems, on-line
   help systems.

6. Architectures for adaptive hypermedia systems. How such systems can be
   integrated with other user-model-based systems (i.e. ITS).

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

The workshop will have a round-table format. Its duration will be 4
hours.  Several presentations based on the accepted papers will be
given. The workshop starts with presentations of several implemented
adaptive hypermedia systems followed by position papers presentation.
The presentations are intended to act as catalysts for discussion of
various problems related with adaptive hypermedia.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should
be directed to the workshop organizers.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Submit a position papers or short work report of 2-4 pages. Send
submissions in plain ascii format to the organizers: plb@plb.icsti.su
and beaumont@ibmt.fhg.de . Authors whose papers are accepted will be
requested to prepare 10-20 minute presentations of their work. Authors
of short work report papers are welcome to send a copy of their
previous publications on adaptive hypermedia related with the topic of
their papers. The accepted papers will not be included into the
conference proceedings. However, conference organizers will ensure
that a sufficient number of copies of all accepted papers will be
available for the workshop.

                Applied Planning and Plan Recognition

MEETING TOPIC

This SIG meeting is intended to bring together researchers in the
field of planning and plan recognition as user modelling techniques,
to discuss the practical use of their work. Issues in focus are:

- novel application areas,
- requirements on knowledge representation in particular applications,
- knowledge acquisition (and machine learning) methods,
- usability and user acceptance of systems exploiting planning or plan
recognition.

The workshop will consist of a small number of presentations
interleaved with in-depth discussions. Papers reporting practical
experiences are particularly encouraged, although position papers also
are welcome.

NOTIFICATION OF PARTICIPATION AND SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Participants should notify the organisers of their intention to
participate in the workshop no later than July 15th.

Participants that wish to make a presentation should submit a three
(3) page abstract of their subject together with their notification of
participation. Abstracts should be submitted preferably by email in
postcript or text form. Hard-copy submissions are also acceptable.

The number of presentations at the workshop will be strictly limited
in order to promote discussions rather than talks. Thus, authors of
some accepted abstracts may not be able to present their work.
However, all accepted abstracts will be included in the workshop
proceedings.

                           DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

Motivation
----------

The idea of offering Doctoral Consortiums at major conferences is becoming
more popular. A number of conferences are offering them this year,
including HCI '94: People and Computers, and OOPSLA '94. This is a
tremendous opportunity for graduate students in User Modeling,
particularly those who are at institutions where there is not a great deal
of active User Modeling research. Students will benefit in several
different ways; primarily by presenting work to a knowledgable audience,
but other benefits include meeting established researchers and other
graduate students doing similar work. This Doctoral Consortium will be
especially timely since, for the first time, the UM-94 conference will
have open participation.

Suggested Topics
----------------

In much the same way that the research done in User Modeling spans several
different domains, graduate research may cover a wide range of topics but
should contribute to some aspect of user modeling and user-adapted
interaction. The conference Call for Participation includes a
comprehensive list of possible topics.

Format of the Consortium
------------------------

Advanced doctoral students are invited to apply to the consortium to
present their research to scholars and researchers in the field who will
provide constructive comments about their work. Students are expected to
have completed their proposals and be able to document in a brief
submission the thesis topic, the approach to be taken and the amount of
work that has already been completed, if any. A small number of applicants
will be chosen by the consortium committee and invited to present their
work in a short presentation. This presentation may include a
demonstration if appropriate. After the presentation the committee members
will informally comment on the student's work. The consortium will be
three hours in length, from 2:30-5:30 pm on Wednesday, August 17, 1994.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Students who are interested in participating should submit a two page
abstract of their doctoral research in plain ascii format to:
     strachan@cs.umanitoba.ca

   The Empirical Evaluation of User Models and Adaptive Systems

Although considerable work has been done using empirical data to
construct user models, there has been less empirical support for the
resulting models' usefulness.  If elaborate user models and other
adaptive techniques are to become part of real-world systems, it must
be demonstrated that they can extend and improve those systems.  This
Workshop will provide an opportunity for those interested in this
important topic to share their ideas and experience.  The Workshop
will consist of short position papers, brief reports of empirical
studies and discussion.  It should serve as a forum for identifying
components of user models and adaptive systems requiring empirical
investigation, presenting methodological proposals for how such
investigations might be conducted, identifying areas in which work is
being done and where work is still needed, presenting short reports
describing the findings from empirical studies, and finally,
identifying advantages, disadvantages and limitations of such studies.
Discussion of issues and sharing of ideas are key to a successful
Workshop, and as much time as possible will be provided for
interaction among the participants.

Submissions of position papers and brief reports are invited, including
work-in-progress.

SIG Workshop Format:
---------------------------

The Workshop will be be limited to 3 hours and will be held on Wednesday,
August 17 from 2:30-5:30.  The time available should allow for up to five
brief reports and position papers.  The presentations are intended to
focus
discussion and stimulate a lively exchange of ideas on the topic.  Some
attempt will be made at the end of the Workshop to summarize the issues
and
direction of this area.

Attendance at the Workshop
----------------------------------

Attendance at the workshop will include those individuals who have
submitted papers or reports.  The Workshop will also be open to those who
have been active in the area or who intend to work in the area in future.

            The relationship between user and task models

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

Task models are an important source of information for adaptive and/or
adaptable systems. They contain information about the necessary tools,
the participating objects, etc. From such task descriptions, for
example, competence models can be derived. However, there is evidence
that the design of of most prototypical adaptive systems is not
explicitly based on task modeling. The workshop tries to identify the
difficulties of employing task models as an information source and to
work out possible approaches to overcome these difficulties.

Submissions of position papers or short work reports are invited.
Topics include, but are not limited to:

   * task modeling and plan recognition
   * intelligent user support based on task models
   * extension of task models (task induction, evaluation) and
     its relationship to machine learning
   * user-adapted presentation of task models
   * acquisition of task knowledge
   * representation of task knowledge

The presentation of ongoing work is encouraged.

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

The workshop will have a round-table format. Up to five presentations
based on
the accepted papers will be given. Its duration will be 3 hours. The
presentations are intended to act as catalysts for discussion which can
and
should go beyond the presentations themselves.

Attendance
----------

Attendance at the workshop will be restricted to persons whose
position paper or work report has been accepted.  Participants should
register for both the workshop and the general conference.  For those
who do not register for the general conference a small amount
(probably $50) will be charged to cover miscellaneous expenses and a
snack break.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should
be directed to the workshop organizer.

Submission Requirements
-----------------------

Submit a position papers or short work report of 2-5 pages. Authors whose
papers
are accepted will be requested to prepare an informal 5-10 minute
presentation
of their work.

Send submissions in plain ascii or Latex source format to
gerhard@faw.uni-ulm.de, or mail 3 copies of hardcopy submissions to
Gerhard Peter at the address below. Electronic submissions are preferred.
Please do not send floppy disks or tapes.

Important Dates
---------------

July 15    1994  Deadline for submissions
July 20    1994  Notification of acceptance

THE ROLE OF USER MODELING IN KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND KNOWLEDGE
REPRESENTATION

The purposes of user modeling are several. For the cognitive
scientist, an improved understanding of user behavior helps flesh our
the cognitive model of problem solving.  This, of course, has
implications for knowledge representation and human-computer
interaction.  For the applications developer, the contextual
anticipation of user skills and needs incresases the likelihood that
the user will deem the software to be usable, useful, and worthy using
after the novelty wears off.  User modeling can also allow software to
grow over time.  In short, the concept of user modeling holds
significant pomise for a wide range of research and development
activities in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and software
development.

User modeling also presents significant challenges, particulaely when
the application domain is complex.  Even under the assumptions that
(a) it suffices to "extract" knowledge from a single domain expert,
and (b) such an expert is available, several issues remain.  In
addition, one needs more than an expert to interview as a user - a
range of users from novice on up is needed.

First, who is going to sit at the keyboard; i.e., the direct user?
The amount and kind of intervention, constraint checking, and advice
depends on several factors, including the nature of the problem to be
solved, the stage of solution, and the skill level of the problem
solver.  For example, one might expect the needs and behaviors of a
domain novice to differ substantially from those of a domain expert.
Those needs may also vary depending on how well-defined the problem
is, or how complete or satisfactory the solution is.  This has
implications for the knowledge acquisition process itself, as well as
for how the knowledge acquired is used in the application system to
add user modeling enhanced capabilities.

Second, despite the availability of a human expert, that person's
relevant "compiled" knowledge may be inaccessible outside of his or
her work environment.  Knowledge acquisition is complex and one must
take into account the environment and people who are being queried.
For example, reasonably "chunked" problems used in laboratory settings
may be too pristine to provide a natural incentive for the problem
solver to ignore the knowledge acquisition task, of which he/she is
the focus, and delve into the problem.  Similarly, the expert's deep
knowledge and behaviors may remain submerged because the selected
problem is not real; i.e., there are no consequences of a bad or
simplistic solution.  The resulting user model may be aimed at a
fictitious ideal user.  Under such circumstances, the real user may
either perform inadequately or feel inadequately served.

The purpose of this workshop is to explore methods for research and
development of large knowledge-based systems, in domains in which
expertise is difficult to access.  The specific focus is on the
central role that user modeling can play in (a) the knowledge
acquisition/software development process, (b) the development of
successful human-computer interfaces, and (c) the underlying knowledge
representation that connects the two.

           Standardization of User Modeling Shell Systems

One can expect that user modeling shell systems will play an increasingly
important role in the next few years. It therefore seems advisable to
standardize the interface between applications and user modeling shells,
and possibly also aspects of user modeling shell systems that are already
scientifically established. The standardization of the interface will
allow
programmers of adaptable and adaptive application systems
 (a) to clearly define the boundary between the application and the user
     modeling components,
 (b) to delay the selection of a user modeling shell until the user
modeling
     needs of the application are clearly defined, and
 (c) to switch to a different user modeling shell when the user modeling
needs
     of the application increase or decrease, or when a new shell system
with
     the same functionality becomes available that is preferable for other
     reasons.
The standardization of scientifically established aspects of user modeling
shell systems would include:
(a) Standardization of the functionality of a user modeling system:
    application programmers would profit if there were a basic minimal
    functionality that all user modeling systems would fulfill;
(b) Standardization of the user modeling terminology: application
    programmers (and also scientists) would profit if common terminology
    would be employed in the description of user modeling shell systems.

The aim of this SIG meeting is to explore the needs for standardization in
cooperation between shell developers and application-directed researchers,
and to fix a priority list and (if possible) a time-table for future work.
Participants should give short presentations that include position
statements, work reports, or proposals regarding the topic of the
workshop.
Written summaries of not more than 2-4 pages in plain ascii format should
be sent to the organizer: kobsa@inf-wiss.uni-konstanz.de. The accepted
papers will be distributed among the workshop participants.

             USER MODELING IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS

MOTIVATION
      Adaptive systems for Information Retrieval (IR) are become
increasingly
important with the growth and availability of data-bases and
Hypermedia. More and more users who are unfamiliar with the system
and/or domain have access to IR systems and face difficulties in
formulating good queries. The need of adaptive IR systems that can
help the user search for information has been recently recognised by
industry and this field promises to become one of a great commercial
interest in the near future.
      Adaptivity of software can be obtained by modelling the users and
tailoring the system's interactions to their goals/tasks/interests.
There are a lot of general issues concerning User Modeling in IR.
So far, however, little or no integration of work on UM in IR has
been done, in order to compare and evaluate the general problems and
approaches in this field. The goal of the SIG Meeting is to
discuss the issues of User Modeling in IR - to help create a
picture of the state of the art, to exchange experience and to find the
promising tendencies in the field.

SUGGESTED TOPICS
The SIG discussion will be focused on identifying the common and
specifics of User Modelling (UM) in systems for Information Retrieval
(IR). The discussion will center around the following questions:

1. In what ways can adaptivity help the user of an IR system? How much
adaptivity and adaptability is desirable in an IR context? How to
support optimally collaborative and individual work?

2. What sorts of information does the user model need to enable these
types of adaptation and adaptability?

3. How can the User Model acquire this information?

4. How can this information best be represented internally and
processed? How can general UM approaches be applied and compared in
the context of different types of applications?

5. What knowledge acquisition techniques can be used for UM in IR (for
example, in defining user-groups, user-interests, user-tasks)? What
degree of co-operation from the users can be expected? Is it possible
to create methodologies for UM in certain types of applications?

6. What types of applications are currently of interest for industry?
What practical limitations exist?

PARTICIPATION
The goal of the meeting is to carry out a DISCUSSION rather than
another paper-presentation session. Therefore, participants are encouraged
to share their ideas about the provided topics around which the
discussion will focus. Of course, if anyone would like to propose a
new topic, (s)he shouldn't hesitate to do so! Every potential participant
can contribute to the discussion in one of the following ways:
        (1) prepare statements on one or several of the listed topics.
Each
statement should be not longer than 1 page. It would be very good, if
the participant's own work with respect to the given topic is addressed,
however this is not required. Provocative statements are welcome!
        (2) propose a new topic of discussion and provide a 1-page
motivation for doing so and a statement on this topic.
        (3) prepare a short presentation-summary (max. 3 pages) of
their own experience in the field, but in a way that it explicitly
addresses some of the mentioned topics or poses new ones.

FORMAT OF THE SIG MEETING
The SIG meeting will take about 3 hours. The discussion will be moderated
in a way to show different, hopefully conflicting viewpoints in a dynamic
way. All participants will have the chance to present their ideas in 5 to
10 minutes, long self-contained presentations will not be tolerated.  An
attempt to summarise and draw conclusions from the discussion will be
made finally.

SUBMISSION
Submissions are expected in one of the three types (1), (2) or (3). They
should
be sent in plain ASCII text format or in RTF (file interchange format) to
                          jiv@informatik.unibw-muenchen.de
Write subject of the message "SIG submission".
Authors are also welcome to send copies of their papers, if they think
this
will help to explain with more details their position statements or
presentations.
For this they can use the postal address below.

The accepted statements and presentations will not be published in the
conference proceedings. However, copies will be made available together
with
protocols of the discussion after the SIG meeting.
