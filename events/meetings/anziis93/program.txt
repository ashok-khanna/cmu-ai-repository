                   Intelligent Information Systems

                      Perth,  Western Australia


Tutorials:      30      November  1993
Conference:     1-3     December  1993


ANZIIS-93  ADVANCE  PROGRAMME

ANZIIS-93 is the inaugural Australian and New-Zealand conference on
Intelligent Information Systems to be held in Perth, Western Australia. 
Well over 200 papers have been submitted in the four targeted areas of
Artificial Intelligence, Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks and Virtual
Reality.  It is a multi-disciplinary meeting that will bring together
engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists and
psychologists.

The main conference, 1-3 December 1993, includes three keynote addresses by
distinguished visitors from the USA and UK.  108 papers will be presented
orally and 68 in poster format by Australian and New Zealand as well as
overseas delegates.  The papers have been selected after review by at least
two Australian and one overseas referees.  The topics include fundamental
research and applications in the areas of image processing, robotics,
control, biomedicine, virtual reality, wavelet transforms, genetic
algorithms, speech processing and hybrid systems.

Four pre-conference tutorials have been arranged for Tuesday 30 November 1993.


Keynote Speakers
================

Professor George Lendaris is Professor of Systems Science at the Portland
State University.  He has served in a number of government technical
advisory committees and has frequently acted as a consultant to industry. 
He was recently the General Chairman of the International Joint Conference
on Neural Networks held in Portland, July 1993.  His interest lies in
developing methodology for assisting teams of people to carry out systems
design engineering, analysis of social and human systems, models for
complex systems, structure and modelling, artificial intelligence and
neural networks with application to conceptual graph knowledge systems.

Professor Robert Stone is Visiting Professor of Virtual Reality at the
University of Salford.  He is also the Technical Manager of the UK's
National Advanced Robotics Research Centre in Salford, with further
responsibility for the Centre's Human Factors, Virtual Reality and
Telepresence programmes.  Professor Stone is a Registered Practitioner of
the UK Ergonomics Society and a Chartered Associate Fellow of the British
Psychological Society.  He is a member of the Editorial Boards of journals
including Virtual Reality Systems, Displays and Presence.  He received the
UK Ergonomics Society's 1993 Otto Edholm Award for his work on Virtual
Reality.

Professor Jacek Zurada is the Director of the S. T. Fife VLSI Circuit
Design Laboratory at the University of Louisville, Kentucky USA.  His
specialisation is microelectronic analog and digital circuits for signal
processing and neural networks.  He is the author of a successful ANN
textbook: Introduction to Artificial Neural Systems and co-author of Active
RC Filters.  Dr Zurada served as Chairman of the CAS Neural Systems and
Applications Committee and is now Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on
Neural Networks and the Artificial Neural Networks Journal.  He has
received a number of awards and distinctions including IEEE Outstanding
Electronic Engineer.


Tutorial Sessions
=================

Four different tutorials will be held on Tuesday 30 November.  These will
be repeated in the afternoon to allow delegates to attend two tutorial
sessions.  Please indicate your preference for a.m. or p.m. in your
registration form.  There is a limited number of tutorial places so please
book early.

T-1     Virtual Reality    Presented by:   Professor Robert Stone

This tutorial will start by reviewing the history of VR with its successes
and failures, hype and fact, then will concentrate on how the VR
technologies - headsets, gloves, other forms of peripherals, graphics
hardware and software - have evolved from the 1980's to meet the
applications demanded by users over the next decade.  Where will VR find
its way into the technical practices of companies?  Are there any
commercial benefits to adopting VR as opposed to the more industry-accepted
"desktop" or workstation implementations?  What kinds of VR data exchange
and interface standards are emerging and is it too early for
standardisation?  These and other issues will be discussed during the
tutorial presentation.

T-2     Learning Algorithms     Presented by:   Professor Jacek Zurada

Learning is a fundamental property of networks acquiring computational
intelligence.  In ANN learning takes the form of approximation of
relationships from data or the form of encoding desired equilibria.  This
tutorial reviews the basic concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning
of most important ANN architectures.  The tutorial stresses the
visualization of learning in both pattern and weight space.  It
demonstrates links between various methods of network adaptation schemes. 
The material presented is addressed to persons interested in pursuing
independent research/study/ANN modelling who are also seeking understanding
of concepts underlying computational properties of ANN.

T-3     Neural Networks and Expert Systems    Presented by:  Professor
                                                             George Lendaris

After defining the fundamental ideas and terminologies used in ANN and
symbolic AI with respect to expert systems, this tutorial will discuss the
ease or difficulty of implementing the following properties in ANNs: 
reasoning by forward chaining and backward chaining, issues of
declarative/procedural knowledge and distributed representation, ability to
provide explanations, information acquisition for expert systems,
extraction of rules, noise and probabilistic considerations.  Examples
include If-Then rules implemented via Fuzzy Logic and how ANNs can assist
in gathering data to formulate and refine such fuzzy rules.

T-4     Wavelet Transforms and Applications    Presented by:  Professor
                                                              Thong Nguyen

This tutorial will introduce and explain wavelet transform theory including
short-term Fourier Transforms, definitions and characteristics of popular
wavelets, frame of discrete wavelets, graphical derivation of wavelet
analysis, multiresolution signal analysis using wavelet transforms,
Mallat's recursive algorithm, bi-orthogonal wavelet bases, Daubechies'
wavelet design procedure and applications in multiresolution video coding,
fractal analysis and other signal processing.
