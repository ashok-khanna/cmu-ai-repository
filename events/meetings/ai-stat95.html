                           Call For Papers
                    Fifth International Workshop on

                       Artificial Intelligence
                                and
                             Statistics

                          January 4-7, 1995
                       Ft. Lauderdale, Florida

PURPOSE:
This is the fifth in a series of workshops which has 
brought together researchers in Artificial Intelligence and in
Statistics to discuss problems of mutual interest. The exchange has 
broadened research in both fields and has strongly encouraged 
interdisciplinary work.

This workshop will have as its primary theme:

                   ``Learning from data''

Papers on other topics at the interface of AI & Statistics
are *strongly* encouraged as well (see TOPICS below).

FORMAT:
To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the
presentations will be limited to about 20 discussion papers in single
session meetings over three days (Jan. 5-7). Focussed poster 
sessions will provide the means for presenting and discussing the 
remaining research papers. Papers for poster sessions will be treated 
equally with papers for presentation in publications.

Attendance at the workshop will *not* be limited.

The three days of research presentations will be preceded by a day
of tutorials (Jan. 4).  These are intended to expose researchers 
in each field to the methodology used in the other field. The Tutorial 
Chair is Prakash Shenoy. Suggestions on tutorial topics can be sent to
him at pshenoy@ukanvm.bitnet.

LANGUAGE:
The language will be English.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:

The fifth workshop has a primary theme of

          ``Learning from data''

At least one third of the workshop schedule will be set aside for 
papers with this theme. Other themes will be developed according
to the strength of the papers in other areas, including but not
limited to:

     - integrated man-machine modeling methods
     - empirical discovery and statistical methods for knowledge
       acquisition
     - probability and search
     - uncertainty propagation
     - combined statistical and qualitative reasoning
     - inferring causation
     - quantitative programming tools and integrated software for
       data analysis and modeling.
     - discovery in databases
     - meta data and design of statistical data bases
     - automated data analysis and knowledge representation for
       statistics
     - connectionist approaches
     - learning theory
     - cluster analysis


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:
Three copies of an extended abstract (up to four pages) should be
sent to
