                       AAAI 1994 Fall Symposium 
            Knowledge Representation for Natural Language Processing 
                             in 
                     Implemented Systems

                     November 4-6, 1994
            The Monteleone Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana


Call for Participation

This symposium is intended to be a meeting of researchers actively working 
on implemented knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) systems 
for general natural language processing (NLP) in order to assess the current 
state of that field. Specific topics of interest include the following:

Expressiveness and generality of the representation language with respect to 
natural language. For example, coverage of complex object descriptions and 
treatment of quantification. What are the trade-offs in increasing the 
expressiveness of the representation language to support natural language? 

Inference methods that parallel reasoning in natural language. Natural 
deduction systems, for example, are so called because of the apparent 
naturalness of the proof procedure. Another example is surface reasoning, 
based on the syntactic structure of the natural language.

Ability of the formalism or system to capture important semantic and 
pragmatic aspects of natural language. For example, the computational 
relationship between the representation language and the parser/generator.
Is it possible to define the representation language to facilitate this 
relationship? At what cost?

How many or kinds of representation languages are needed for general 
NLP? Many NLP systems actually use two representation languages: a 
semantic representation language that captures the semantics of a sentence, 
and a knowledge representation language that is used to do reasoning and 
represent the system's general knowledge about the domain. Typically these 
languages are quite different, with the former being a much more powerful 
language (including modalities, lambda expressions and other higher order 
constructs, generalized quantifiers, etc) and the latter being what the 
system's reasoning engine actually operates on, usually something more or 
less equivalent to first-order logic, (or an even more restricted vivid 
representation like a relational database) This raises the question of how 
these languages relate to each other, and if it is possible (or desirable) to 
have a semantic representation language that supports inference.

Stands on issues such as: 
-  What problems are solved, and how to use the solution(s).
-  What areas need work.
-  Defense or attacks of the standard design of morphology-syntax-
   semantics-pragmatics.

Submissions to the symposium should address these topics by showing 
some text that an actual implemented system can understand, how the 
information contained in that text is represented, what background 
information is used by the system, how that information is represented, 
how the system processes the knowledge to do interesting things (such as 
answering interesting questions about the text), and how the information is 
processed into answers. Reports on projects whose purpose is to simulate 
human understanding of texts will be preferred over projects whose purpose 
is to provide natural language interfaces to databases, planners, or to 
pragmatically oriented knowledge bases.

The format of this symposium will be designed to encourage interaction 
amongst the participants. To this end, new, previously unpublished work-
in-progress on the topics of the symposium is most desirable, as are stands 
on the issues outlined above.

Submission Information
Potential attendees should submit an extended abstract of no more than 10 
pages (exclusive of references), twelve point, double-spaced, with one inch 
margins. Submissions not conforming to these guidelines will not be 
reviewed. 

The symposium format will also include one or more panel discussions on 
the issues listed above. Attendees wishing to participate in panels, or 
wishing to suggest other panel topics, should indicate their interest and 
include a current vita along with their extended abstract.

Demonstrations of working NLP/KRR systems are also of interest, 
however attendees must provide their own hardware and software support. 
Attendees interested in this option should indicate what they are planning on 
demonstrating, and how they propose to do so. This information should be 
provided with their extended abstract in a cover letter that clearly
states their interest in this option.

Email submission is preferred, and should be directed to the Symposium 
Chair at

 ssa231f@csm560.smsu.edu and
 syali@cs.buffalo.edu

Preferred email submission formats are: stand-alone LaTeX, PostScript, or 
plain text (for abstracts without complex figures, etc). 

If email submission is not possible, then five copies of the paper should be 
mailed to the Symposium Chair:

			Call for Participation
 		   AAAI 1994 Fall Symposium Series
 
	       Improving Instruction of Introductory AI 
				(IIIA)

			  November 4-6, 1994
                        New Orleans, Louisiana


Introductory Artificial Intelligence is a notoriously difficult course
to teach well. The two most straightforward strategies are to either
present a smorgasbord of topics or to focus on one or two central
approaches. The first option often yields disjointed and superficial
results, whereas the second presents an incorrectly biased picture.
Often students come away with a feeling that the subject matter is not
coherent and that the field has few significant achievements.

Other issues instructors must face are: What should the balance be between 
the emphasis on cognitive modeling vs. engineering solutions to hard 
problems? How should one handle the well-known phenomenon of 
solutions that work no longer being considered to be part of AI?

What strategies do instructors take to deal with these issues? What are some 
underlying themes that can be used to help structure the material? Are there 
sets of principles that can be used to instruct the material, even if they
do not precisely reflect all of the current viewpoints? 

We propose that the AI community meet and tackle these issues together. 
The goal of the symposium is to provide an opportunity to discuss these 
difficult questions, as well as to share successful strategies, problem 
assignments, instructional programs, and instructional "bloopers."

The symposium will be organized as a workshop, although there will be 
tutorial aspects, allowing participants to learn from the experiences of 
colleagues who have worked out successful solutions. All attendees will 
participate in less formal breakout sessions as well as in discussion 
following presentations.

We are soliciting four kinds of contributions, corresponding to four 
presentation types. 

Type I
A discussion of a successful strategy for instructing introductory AI, based 
on experience. The descriptions should be centered around a syllabus and 
must describe how the strategy handles the smorgasbord versus bias 
problem, i.e., what underlying unifying themes give cohesiveness to the 
approach while at the same time covering the material well. Accepted 
descriptions (one to three pages plus the syllabus) will appear in the 
working notes, and the authors of some of these will be asked to present 
these ideas in the form of a talk.

Those submitting papers on successful overall approaches should also 
address the following issues, and optionally those listed under Type II as 
well.

1) What are the basics that must be covered, and how are they integrated 
into the theme of the course?

2) One strategy is to describe a problem to be solved and then discuss 
several different techniques that attempt to solve the problem. The inverse 
strategy describes a technique and then explores how well it performs on 
different problem types. Which, if either, strategy is used?

3) What kind of curriculum does this fit in to? (E.g., isolated undergraduate 
semester, part of an intelligent systems series, overview for graduate 
students, etc.)

Type II
A position paper addressing at least one of the following issues (one to four 
pages). Selected position papers will appear in the working notes and some 
authors will be asked to participate in well-structured, strongly moderated 
panel discussions (i.e., answers to a small set of questions prepared in 
advance).

Content issues include:

1) What is the role of cognitive motivation, if any? Should there be an 
   emphasis on simulating intelligence, modeling the mind, etc.?

2) What is the role of formalism?

3) Should commercially feasible aspects be addressed, and if so, how? 

4) How should we address the question, is it still AI if it can be done?

5) What role should advanced areas (e.g., vision, robotics) play?

6) What kind of hooks should be left for more in-depth courses (e.g., 
   graduate ML, NLP, vision, KR, connectionism, etc.)?

7) What is the role of historical developments? Should this be a structuring 
   theme?

Curricular issues include:

1) What kind of department; interaction with other subareas, e.g.: cognitive 
systems, intelligent systems.

2) What kind of educational program: One semester or quarter overview? A 
two or three semester series centered around a theme (e.g., KR)?

3) Undergraduate versus graduate: How much should they overlap? 
Remedial introduction for those who never took undergraduate AI? What 
are the positive and negative results? Undergrad pedagogical, hands on 
experience? Graduate reading: primary sources?

Teaching college perspective issues include:
1) What are the special issues?

2) How can pooled resources help?

Laboratory involvement issues include:

1) Is programming useful or a time waster? Is it better to use and observe 
existing tools instead? Or is a compromise--modifying existing programs--
best?

Innovative ideas?

Type III
Informative descriptions of programming tools for assignments and as 
instructional aids. Many potential symposium participants have expressed 
interest in acquiring a collection of useful programs both for demonstration 
of AI concepts and for use in homework assignments in lieu of requiring 
students to spend their time programming. This is an opportunity to 
advertise tools, videotapes, and other teaching aids. We would like all 
participants that have used tools that they have found to be useful to list 
these tools, and all developers of new tools to describe them. For those who 
have created new tools, we would like to create a repository of same.

Type III submissions should address at least one of the following (one to 
five pages):

1) Descriptions of new educational tools specifically designed for 
instruction of AI (e.g., The FLAIR project of Papalaskari et al.).

2) Recommendations and pans of existing tools as instructional aids.

3) Proposals for tools or tool construction methodologies that don't exist 
   but should.

4) Tools for empirical exploration (e.g., a tutorial guide to the tools in the 
   machine learning repository, as applied for instructional purposes).

Type IV
Contributory questions (one to two pages). Those wishing to participate but 
who do not wish to contribute in one of the previous categories must 
indicate their interest by describing what issues they are interested in 
(including those listed above) and suggesting questions to be addressed by 
the symposium. Descriptions of bloopers--mistakes made that others 
should be warned away from, are also appropriate. We are especially 
interested in topics to be discussed by small groups, and questions to be 
asked of the panelists.

Submission Information:
Authors may send contributions of more than one type, if desired. Only one 
document should be submitted. A submitter who wants to make more than 
one type of submission should simply label each part of the document with 
the appropriate type (Type I, Type II, etc).

Email submissions are strongly preferred. Send one copy, plain text, to: 
marti@cs.berkeley.edu. PostScript is acceptable if it is accompanied by a 
plain text version as well; this way diagrams can be included in an electronic 
form. Those people who cannot send an electronic version should send 
three hard copies to:
