Subject: Spring Symposium - prepare for the deluge

Folks-
 This of you getting this message (and not on the symposium committee) are
people who are chairing or co-chairing a SPring Symposium in the Spring 
1994 AAAI Symposium series.  In the next few minutes you'll get several
messages from me:  a schedule of important dates, a list of the symposia
for your series, and a long message chock full of important info for
chairs.  Please read the latter as soon as you can - it should answer
most of yor questions.

 The most important thing I need from you now is a call for participation 
statement to go into the brochure for the series.  This is expected to
be fairly similar to the first part of your proposal -- just be sure
to clean up anything you feel inappropriate to the generally distributed
document.  I MUST GET THE CALL FROM YOU BY NEXT WEDNESDAY (7/28)!!!
Sorry about the short notice, but with all the delays and stuff we
must get moving, and I expect this to be a low work item...

 For some reason AI Mag said the deadline for submissions was Sept. 7.
The correct date is October 15, so please reassure anyone asking you.
 -Jim Hendler
p.s. Please cc: Lynn Stein (las@ai.mit.edu) on correspondence.

Communications:

We want very much to handle just about all communication by electronic
mail.  Please give us an electronic mail address that you read on a regular
basis.  If you need to contact AAAI, you should use sss@aaai.org or
fss@aaai.org, as appropriate.  The phone number for AAAI is 415 328-3123.
Annette Eldredge is the Symposium Coordinator at AAAI.

Deadlines:

One thing about running several symposia in parallel is that deadlines are
very important.  To get things done on time, we will have to be strict
about all deadlines.  In particular, if you miss the deadline for having
your call for participation ready, your symposium may be dropped.

Call for Participation:

Your first duty is to get your symposium committee together and prepare
your call for participation.  You send us a draft of this call, and we will
help revise it if necessary.  AAAI will then collect, edit, typeset,
proofread, print, and mail out the calls to the entire AAAI membership.

So what needs to be done now is for you to decide with your program
committee what your Call for Participation should be like.  This is a
good time to think about how you plan to run the symposium and, if you
are going to do something especially creative, to slant your Call
appropriately.  (See the section on Symposium Activities, below.)  In
any case, your Call needs to include a title, short description,
submission information, and the program committee of your symposium.
Don't worry about generic symposium information (like what's a
symposium?  where?  when?) as this will be in the part of the Call
that AAAI and I put together.

You need to decide what you want people to send you so that you can
select attendees.  As far as we are concerned, the only requirement is
that this material should ensure that you and your committee can
fairly review potential attendees.  You should think about how much
paper you want to sift through and also about what information will be
most useful to you in making your decisions.  In the end, most of you
will probably want abstracts of new or existing papers; but short
position statements, full papers, or even CVs are ok, if you and your
committee could do a better job with them.  Please note that this
material can be completely unrelated to the material that winds up in
the Working Notes (see below).  AAAI has copies of previous calls for
participation.  If you would like to use one as a guide, AAAI can
either mail or FAX one to you.

Publicity:

The Call for Participation will be sent out to the entire AAAI
membership.  In addition, we try to hit a few of the major bulletin
boards, like comp.ai and news.announce.conferences.  However, YOU WILL
almost certainly WANT TO SEND OUT TARGETED MAILINGS OF YOUR PARTICULAR
CALL TO YOUR FAVORITE MAILING LISTS, BULLETIN BOARDS, AND OTHER GROUPS
OF PEOPLE.  This is especially important if you think that a large
fraction of your potential audience are not AAAI members.
Historically, we receive a large number of complaints from people who
have forgotten about the deadline by the time that it arrives (or who
have misplaced the Call among their many AAAI mailings).  It is always
a good idea to RESEND/REPOST THESE MAILINGS or otherwise remind people
ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE.

We suggest that you not issue direct invitations to people you really
wish to attend your symposium, but instead contact these people and
encourage them to submit material.  (This leads to less work on your
part getting the schedule complete and getting the working notes
together.)

Symposium Activities:

Most symposia should have more discussion and interaction than
conference-style paper presentations.  In the past, symposia run like
mini-conferences have been less successful than those with at least
half of the time devoted to discussion or other open-format items.
Some unusual formats that have been tried include:

    o A set of questions circulated in advance; presenters
      limited to addressing those questions.

    o Papers presented by an attendee other than the author.

    o Break-out sessions where subgroups discuss particular items,
      then meet to present their conclusions.

    o In a symposium in which there was little shared background,
      each session began with a long tutorial talk followed by
      several 6-minute presentations of research and then open
      discussion.  

No matter what format you choose, you should at the very least try to
have discussants or discussion periods that are more than just
question periods.  One way is to have 2 or 3 short talks in a 90
minute session, taking 45 to 50 minutes total; followed by a
commentary, whose purpose is to expose discussion topics; and ending
with open discussion, led by the commentator.  In this scheme, the
commentator should not try to bring up new topics, but can try to
generalize, or make conclusions.  The commentator should get advance
copies of the talks, or, preferably, already be familiar with the work
of the presenters.  You could even dispense with formal presentations
entirely, and instead have the commentator summarize the submissions
with the authors responding to this summary.  (One advantage of this
approach is that it will keep the symposium focussed on fewer topics.)

If you decide to have a major speaker you should also have a commentator or
panel; this is not only an excellent way to lead into a discussion, but it
also encourages the speaker to say something worthy of commentary.

There is no problem with presenting work-in-progress in the symposia,
rather than just finished work, so you could encourage this.

Symposium-hopping is discouraged.  IF YOU FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE
SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP BETWEEN YOUR SYMPOSIUM AND ANOTHER THAT IS BEING
OFFERED AT THE SAME TIME, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER HOLDING ONE OF YOUR
SESSIONS JOINTLY.  



WORKING NOTES AND TECHNICAL REPORTS:

The Working Notes are given to participants are for discussion
purposes only and will not be distributed beyond the symposium without
permission.  (AAAI will also distribute attendance lists to
participants in your symposium.)  Participants may be encouraged to
resubmit elsewhere a final version based on whatever they give you.

If you wish, you may turn your Working Notes into a AAAI Technical
Report, in which case it will continue to be available from AAAI.
This option requires that each participant sign a Permission to
Distribute Form (available from AAAI; a copy should be mailed to you)
BEFORE the working notes are put together.  Note that if you choose
this option, AUTHORS STILL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR SUBMISSIONS.

Because AAAI supports the symposium series, AAAI Press has right of
first refusal on any book publications explicitly resulting from
symposia.  AAAI Press is not interested in publishing the working
notes verbatim, but is instead interested in edited collections of
papers, including related papers that were not presented at the
symposia.  We suggest that you contact AAAI Press soon if you want to
prepare a book.  If AAAI Press takes too long to make a decision, let
us know.  (AAAI Press may want two decision points, one on the
concept, and one on the actual set of papers; this is fine in our
view.)

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE WORKING NOTES and sending them to
AAAI for duplication.  The working notes should be double column, with at
least 3/4" of white space on all sides of 8 1/2" by 11" paper.  (If anyone
uses A4 paper, they should not center on the A4 paper, but instead center
on an 8 1/2" by 11" area measured from the top left corner of the A4
paper.)  You can use the style guides of any of the recent AAAI or IJCAI
conferences, as long as they leave the correct amount of white space.  The
reason for using the double-column format is to put more information on the
page---not to imply publication-quality treatment.  Each set of working
notes should be under 200 double-column pages; you are free to juggle the
sizes of various submissions as long as you stay under the total limit.


SYMPOSIUM SIZE AND PARTICIPATION:

Because the symposia should be oriented towards discussion, the default
size for symposia will be about 60 people.  Small symposia (40 or fewer
attendees), as well as large symposia (about 100 participants), are also
possible.  There may be some nice smaller rooms available to us, so there
is an extra bonus for thinking small.  To change from the default size,
however, requires, consultation with us and the AAAI office, to ensure
that both facilities and logistical support can handle the change.

You and we have to select the size that your symposium will be.  If
you don't say anything, your size will be the default size.  You can
then select up to 75% of this number of people unless we agree on some
larger percentage.  The remainder of the participants in your
symposium will be selected by AAAI on a FIRST-COME FIRST-SERVED basis,
in response to the call for registration.

You will be able to find out which of your selected participants have
registered, and will be able to make replacements if necessary.  At some
time AAAI will replace the unregistered selected participants by people
from the first-come first-served pool.

You can use any criteria to select participants that you wish (except that
you should not be arbitrary, and should not exclude people with different
viewpoints from that of your committee without good reason), and can even
determine the criteria as you read the submissions.  You may ask for
different things in the working notes but you will have to ride herd on
your submitters to ensure that they make appropriate changes.

If you have submissions with multiple authors, you can select all authors,
a particular author, or several particular authors.  Also, and perhaps
best, you can select an author but allow substitutions within the group.
If you chose this later course you should correspond directly with the
submitters, as AAAI will be sending out registration material as if they
were for particular authors.


Money:

If you incur costs related to your symposium, and cannot find a way
for your institution to cover them, AAAI will reimburse you.  This is
restricted to reasonable costs for things like duplication and
postage, and DOES NOT INCLUDE TRAVEL COSTS FOR THE CHAIR(s).  AAAI
also will not pay for costs related to program committee meetings or
such (You should be able to do everything electronically anyway).
Please let us know of any costs that you will need to be reimbursed
for BEFORE you incur them.

AAAI will waive registration fees (but not housing fees) for symposium
chairs.  If you plead particularly hard, AAAI may also waive registration
fees for select members of your committee or particularly important
participants who would not otherwise be able to come.  Don't expect to get
more than 2 total waivers.  If you are feeling generous, you can give your
free registration to someone else.

EACH SYMPOSIUM WILL RECEIVE $2000 IN DISCRETIONARY FUNDS.  IT IS
HIGHLY PREFERRED THAT THIS MONEY BE USED TO SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENT
TRAVEL, but it is not restricted solely to that purpose.  IF YOU WISH
TO USE IT FOR OTHER THAN GRADUATE TRAVEL, YOU NEED TO INFORM THE
SYMPOSIUM COMMITTE CHAIR(S).  You may decide how many student (or
others) get the the money as well as how much each student gets.  

A note on this funding -- you will need to decide how much can go to
each participant, and they will need to provide receipts at the
meeting.  These receipts will be turned over to you, and by you to
AAAI.  You should try to control these funds carefully - often
something comes up at the last minute, and chairs are caught without
enough money.  In a few rare cases AAAI may be able to help with more
money, but this is problematic and we'd prefer not to be put into that
position. ONE STRATGEY TO CONSIDER is not committing specific dollar
values to students until the time of the meeting (say something like
``I expect about $200 or so to be free'').  That way if additional
requests come up, you've left some leeway.

Again, this money does not have to be used for student funding, but
if you wish to use any for other reasons, you must ask permission of
the symposium committee chair(s).

Plenary Session:

At every symposium series we have had an evening plenary session, open
to the public, in which each chair talked about their symposium.
However, in the past some of the plenary sessions have contained talks
that were boring recitations of titles of talks in the symposium.
This is not the purpose of the plenary sessions, however--the talks
are supposed to present to an audience of AI researchers something
that is interesting and presents some of the issues behind the
symposium. 

Unfortunately, preparing an interesting talk like this can be quite
hard, especially when only 10 or 15 minutes is alloted.  The symposium
chairs, who are busy organizing and running their symposia have
typically NOT had time to prepare good talks for this event.  Thus,
although the default in the past has been for the symposium chairs to
do this themselves, we are now requiring that you FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO
DO IT.  The quality of the speaker, as a ``performer'' should be a key
consideration -- we'd like these talks to be informative, but also
fun.

The speakers should try to focus on one or two issues that are related
to their symposium.  There are other possibilities, such as presenting
a controversy or concern that motivated or arose in the symposium.
We will need to know who is giving the talk for your symposium about a
month before the meeting to give us time to publish the plenary
description.
