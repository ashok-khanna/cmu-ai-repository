                      Preliminary Announcement

                    The Fourteenth International
                         MaxEnt Workshop

                        St John's College
                   Cambridge CB2 1TP, England

                    1 August - 5 August 1994

The Fourteenth International Workshop on Maximum Entropy and
Bayesian Methods in science and Engineering will be held in St
John's College in the University of Cambridge, England.

Bayesian methods in general, and maximum entropy in particular,
are of central importance and have much to offer to practical
scientific data analysis.  The maximum entropy movement and the
evolving Bayesian school in applied statistics have both
developed considerable bodies of experience, and are in
increasing agreement on the basic principles of rational
inference.

MaxEnt94 will strive to take advantage of this synergy.
While keeping the traditional emphasis upon diverse applications
throughout the physical and life sciences, including economics,
engineering, and technological and defence work, the workshop will
also focus on the numerical techniques which are perhaps the main
key to enabling future advances.

The workshop will include state-of-the-art lectures, invited
papers, contributed papers, and poster presentations, with the
first day being a tutorial session on the ideas behind maximum
entropy and Bayesian methods.  Selected papers will be published
in book form by Kluwer Academic Press.  The workshop will be
followed on Saturday, August 6 by a one-day demonstration of
practical techniques by MaxEnt Solutions Ltd.

Contributed papers are presently being solicited.  Preference
will be given to forward-looking papers whose content seems
likely to advance the range and power of the methods.
Abstracts (one page of about 400 words) of proposed papers
should be received by the organisers by May 13, 1994.
