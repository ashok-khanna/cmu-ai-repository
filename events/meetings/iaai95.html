The Seventh Annual Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference
Call for Papers, Panels, and Invited Talks

Montreal, Quebec, Canada
August 21-23, 1995

Sponsored by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence 

Intelligent systems are becoming a reality for many enterprises in the 1990s. 
Rather than being independent technologies, these systems are generally used 
as one component in a complex system. The Seventh Annual Conference on 
Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence will explore how such 
systems are being used as enabling technologies. Through case studies, 
meet-the-author sessions, invited talks, and interactive panel discussions, 
the conference will showcase and promote AI technology at work in today's 
global enterprises. It will highlight the most innovative deployed AI 
applications worldwide and explore critical issues involved in AI development 
and deployment. Successful authors will receive the Annual Innovative 
Applications Award and will be highlighted in AI Magazine. 

-  Jan Aikins, Program Chair 

IAAI Case Study Papers 

Case-study presentation papers, highlighting any area of AI technology, must 
describe deployed applications with measurable benefits. Papers should be 
5-10 pages in length, plus figures. The proceedings on the conference will 
be published by AAAI Press; authors will be required to transfer copyright.

We request that your paper include the following sections:

Title Page: Each copy of the paper must have a title page, including the
title of the paper; the names, affiliations, postal and email addresses, and
phone and FAX numbers of all authors; the name of the tool or language used; 
a designation of the application domain; and a short abstract of less than 
200 words.

Task or Problem Description: Describe the task the application performs or 
the problem it solves. State the objectives of the application and explain 
why an AI solution was important. If other solutions were tried and failed, 
outline these solutions and the reasons for their failure.

Application Description: Describe the application, providing technical details 
about design and implementation. What key aspects of AI technology enabled 
the application to succeed? If applicable, describe how AI technology is 
integrated with other technology. If a commercial tool is used, explain 
the decision criteria used to select it. Describe any insights gained about 
the application of AI technology.

Application Use and Payoff: How long has this application been deployed? 
Explain how widely, how often, and by whom the application is being used. 
Also describe the application's payoff. What measurable benefits have 
resulted from its use? What additional benefits do you expect over time?

Application Development and Deployment: Describe the development and 
deployment processes. How long did they take? How many developers were 
involved? What were the costs? 

Maintenance: Describe your experience with and plans for maintenance of the 
application. Who maintains the knowledge base? How often is update needed? 
Is knowledge in this domain expected to change over time? How does the 
design of the application facilitate update? Have you automated knowledge-
base update in any way?

IAAI Panels

The IAAI panels will focus on critical issues involved in AI development and 
deployment. This series of panels will explore important issues involved in 
delivering effective and successful AI systems.

Each panel should address a practical problem or theme of broad interest to 
developers of AI applications. Panelists should focus on specific issues, 
such as problems and solutions, technical trade-offs, managerial issues, 
organizational concerns, and challenges for the future. Case studies can be
used to illustrate the issues, but should not be the principal focus of the 
panel presentations. 

Panel proposals should include a description of the sessions, the name and 
full address and phone of the principal contact of the organizer, the name of 
the proposed panel moderator, and a list of proposed panelists. Panel 
proposals will be judged based on the importance and relevance of the proposed 
topic, and on the range and experience of the proposed panelists.

Panels in previous years have included topics such as:  

-  AI and Business Process Reengineering 

-  What's next in Knowledge-Based Technology? 

-  How to Get Intelligence/AI into the System 

-  Gaining Support for AI Technologies within Your Organization

IAAI Invited Talks

Each year IAAI invites distinguished speakers from government, business,
and research to share their experiences, as well as their thoughts for the 
future direction of AI development and applications worldwide. Suggestions
for speakers should include the full name, affiliation, postal and email 
addresses, phone and FAX numbers of the speaker; a preliminary title for
the talk; and a short abstract of the proposed talk of no more 200 words. 
One of the invited speakers will be honored with the Dennis O'Connor Memorial
Lecture Award.

Timetable

Submit five (5) clearly legible complete copies of papers, panel proposals,
and invited talk proposals (hard copies only--we cannot accept computer
files) to the AAAI office by January 18, 1995. Papers or proposals received 
after this date will be returned unopened. Notification of receipt will be 
mailed to the first author (or designated author) soon after receipt. All 
inquiries regarding lost papers must be made by January 25, 1995.

Papers, panel proposals, and invited talk proposals will be reviewed by the 
Program Committee in March and notification of acceptance or rejection
will be mailed to the first author (or designated author) by April 8. 
Camera-ready copy of accepted papers will be due about one month later.
