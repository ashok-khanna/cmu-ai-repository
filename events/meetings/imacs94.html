                          HOTEL INFORMATION

We have blocked rooms at the following nearby hotels for the IMACS 14
International Conference 11-15 July 1994.  Special rates will be
available when booked by the end of May and possibly longer.  Be sure
to mention the conference when making reservations in order to get the
special rates.  The conference hotels may require a deposit or credit
card number to reserve the special rate.  Please make your own
arrangements.

The more expensive hotels tend to be more comfortable, although not
necessarily closer to campus.  Locations are shown on the map on the
reverse, which also indicates subway (MARTA) stops.  Many companies
have hotels in Atlanta.  In case you wish to make other lodging
arrangements, we are located just North of Downtown Atlanta, across
Interstate I- 75/85 from Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood.  We are also
easily reached by subway from the airport or any other spot on the
North-South MARTA line (North Avenue exit).

Travel and lodging.  Atlanta is in the Eastern Time Zone.  It has a
major airport served by many domestic and international carriers.
Participants flying to Atlanta from the U.S. or Canada may save money
on Delta Airlines with special conference rates: Call 800-241-6760 and
refer to file UO175 and the name of the conference to get these rates.
This arrangement does not seem to be available for overseas visitors,
but there are separate touristic packages available only from abroad,
such as Delta's Skypass and Discover America Fares, which may be
appropriate if you have plans to visit other cities besides Atlanta.

Amtrak train service to Atlanta is available once a day from
Washington, New Orleans, Birmingham and some other cities.  The
station is on Peachtree St., but not far North of Georgia Tech, and
the reservation number is 800-872-7245.

The most convenient freeway approach is from I-75/85 "the Downtown
Connector."  From the South you will see a sign for 10th St. and
Georgia Tech shortly after passing downtown Atlanta.  From the North,
you have a choice of the 10th St. exit (follow signs when I-75 and
I-85 merge) or, after that, North Avenue.

We have reserved some rooms at the hotels listed on the enclosed
sheet.  All hotels are easily accessible from the Atlanta Airport on
our subway system, known (together with the bus system) as MARTA.
MARTA costs $1.25 and has a station inside the airport, indicated with
a sign with reddish, yellow, blue and white stripes.  All trains from
the airport go near Georgia Tech (North Avenue Station) and the hotels
(North Avenue or 10th St. Station) with no transfer.  On the map the
subway stops are marked with an M (the 10th St. Station and two exits
from the North Avenue Station are shown).  Of course, the airport has
taxi service as well.  Most of the hotels are across a freeway from
the campus, which can be reached by following North Avenue, 3rd
St. (which leads to a pedestrian tunnel under the freeway), or 5th
St., which is called Ferst Dr. on the campus.

Foreign currency exchange.  In the United States neighborhood banks
usually do not exchange currency.  We expect, however, to have a
foreign currency teller available at a few scheduled times at a local
branch of the Wachovia Bank, where it will be possible to change from
major Western European and Japanese currency into dollars.  The
Wachovia Bank will also be able to exchange foreign currency
travelers' checks at all business hours.  In addition, a money machine
on campus will provide cash to a credit card, provided that the bank
issuing the card participates the network.  You may also exchange at
the airport.

Climate.  The weather in July is usually warm (90 F = 32 C) with
nights about (68 F = 20 C) and may be humid.  Some call it a
semi-tropical climate.  An umbrella would be a useful device to have.

Equipment.  Each room will have an overhead projector and blackboard.
Please prepare and being your own transparencies.  We will not have
facilities for the preparation of transparencies.
