i-SAIRAS 1994

Third International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and
Automation for Space

Announcement and Call for Papers

October 18-20, 1994

Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Pasadena, California, U.S.A.


i-SAIRAS 94 is the third in a sequence of international symposia.  The
first was held in Kobe, Japan, in 1990; the second was held in Toulouse,
France, in 1992.  Artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are key
technologies for the future of space endeavors.  The objective of i-SAIRAS
94 is to provide an international forum for engineers, researchers, and
managers working on the development and application of artificial
intelligence and robotics (including rovers) to space programs.  The scope
of i-SAIRAS 94 includes the major programs of research in and
application of artificial intelligence to space.

About the Symposium

The first two i-SAIRAS symposia were successful in providing a
mechanism for people involved in space automation and robotics (A&R) to
form a sense of community -- that is, to get to know one another and
develop common bonds.  The result has been a large increase in
communication among these professionals.  iSAIRAS 94 will continue to
widen and strengthen this worldwide community of space A&R
professionals by providing a forum for talks on successful applications,
current applications, and research and development in space A&R.  The
symposium will also include presentations that place these specific
programs in the context of national programs.  Talks will cover the recent
history of space A&R, current program and technical activities, and the
future plans of national space agencies.

Participating Organizations

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (U.S.A.)
European Space Agency (Europe)
Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences (Japan)
National Space Development Agency (Japan)
National Aerospace Laboratory (Japan)

BACKGROUND

 i-SAIRAS '94 is the third in a sequence of international symposia.  The
first was held in Kobe, Japan in 1990. The second was held in
Toulouse, France in 1992.

 Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and automation are key
technologies for the future of space endeavors.  The objective of this
symposium is to provide an international forum for engineers,
researchers, and managers working on the development and application
of artificial intelligence and robotics, including rovers, to space
programs.  The coverage is broad.  The symposium attempts to cover
most of the major programs of research and application of artificial
intelligence and robotics to space.

 The first two i-SAIRAS symposia were successful in providing a
mechanism for people involved in Space automation and robotics (A&R)
to form a sense of community, that is, to get to know one another, and
to develop common bonds.  The result has been a large increase in
communication among these professionals. i-SAIRAS 94 will continue to
widen and strengthen this worldwide community of Space A&R
professionals.  i-SAIRAS will provide the forum for talks on
successful applications, on current applications , and on research and
development in Space A&R.  There will also be presentations which
place these specific programs in the context of national programs.
Those talks will cover the recent history of Space A&R, current
activities, and future plans in national space agencies.

Special features in i-SAIRAS 94 will be:
 - Space Planning and Scheduling Workshop: This will feature the best
   international space applications and research in Artificial
   Intelligence for planning and scheduling.
 - Commercialization Session:  This will feature papers on the
   commercialization of space related robotics, automation and
   artificial intelligence.
 - Poster Session: This will be for University students doing work in
   Space-related automation, artificial intelligence and robotics.

The topics will include:
 - Artificial Intelligence: mission operations, mission control, ground
   operations, data analysis, planning and scheduling, software
   engineering, electronic documentation, design tools, autonomous
   control, intelligent instruments, etc..
 - Robotics: satellite servicing, ground processing, robots, teleoperation &
   telepresence, manipulator design and control, rover projects,
   rover navigation, etc..

The i-SAIRAS '94 Planning and Scheduling Workshop
-------------------------------------------------


Logistics

The planning and scheduling workshop will be held as part of the
International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and
Automation for Space, 1994 (i-SAIRAS '94), from October 18 through 20,
1994, in Pasadena, California (hosted by JPL).


Organization

The planning and scheduling workshop is organized as a single track
within the overall i-SAIRAS '94 meeting.  The workshop will not be a
venue for purely formal presentations, but will rather attempt to
stimulate extensive discussion and debate.  To achieve this goal,
paper presentations will be 30 minutes long, and questions will be
encouraged throughout.  There will also be a number of panels,
presenting workshop participants with excellent opportunity to air
their views.


Technical Focus: planning and scheduling

The technical focus of the workshop is on planning and scheduling as
applied to space exploration, with specific attention paid to
practical, working systems.  Of technical interest are papers
describing fielded planning or scheduling systems, especially papers
that attempt to evaluate the reasons for a particular system's success
or failure.  Technical topics of interest include, but are not limited
to, the following.
 o Integration of planning and scheduling reasoning.
 o Approaches to managing uncertainty.
 o Plan or schedule execution.
 o Dynamic rescheduling.
 o Constrained optimization.
 o Constraint satisfaction (and does it work for real scheduling problems?).
 o Techniques for characterizing problem difficulty.
 o New frameworks for empirical evaluation.
 o Comparison of AI and operations research techniques.
 o Characterizations of the real problems involved with fielding
   a planning or scheduling system (as opposed to what one might
   academically consider to be the real problems).


Theme: technology transfer

The theme of the workshop is technology transfer, with specific
attention paid to possible "dual uses" of technology.  Technology
developed in government research labs for particular application to
space can have applications in non-space markets.  The reverse is also
true: technology developed for non-space applications can sometimes
work perfectly for space.  This workshop will attempt to establish
connections between technology developed for space and that developed
for non-space (often private industry) markets.  Of particular
interest are the manufacturing and airline industries, since they have
many characteristics in common with space applications.
