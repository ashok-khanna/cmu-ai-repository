          	      CALL FOR PAPERS

	        1st International Conference on

              CONSTRAINTS IN COMPUTATIONAL LOGICS

             September 7--9, 1994, Munich, Germany



Constraints in Computational Logics (CCL) is a new conference
sponsored by the ESPRIT WORKING GROUP ``Construction of Computational
Logics''.

The past two decades have seen a proliferation of different
programming styles: functional, logical, constraint based,
object-oriented, among others.  More recently, it has been recognized
that these styles complement rather than exclude each others by being
suitable for particular problem domains.  As a consequence, combining
programming paradigms has emerged as a significant research direction
of its own, and constraints have often been used as a glue for these
combinations.

CCL aims to attract high quality original papers covering theoretical
and practical issues in this direction of combining and extending
programming paradigms preferably (but not exclusively) by using
constraints. Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:
symbolic constraints, set constraints, numerical constraints, 
constraints for knowledge representation and processing,
use of constraints for type checking and program analysis, 
multi-paradigm programming, abstract properties of combined calculi,
combinations of computational logics,
constraints in rewriting, deduction, and symbolic computations, 
working systems.

CCL'94 will invite 5 lecturers,
Max Dauchet (Symbolic constraints and tree automata),
Dexter Kozen (Set constraints and logic programming),
Helmut Simonis (Applications of constraint logic programming), 
Gert Smolka (Concurrent constraint programming), and
Wayne Snyder (Constraints in automated deduction).

PAPER SUBMISSION: 5 hard copies of a full paper and 16 additional
copies of the cover page and second page should be received by 

		March 25, 1994 by the program chair.  

This is a FIRM deadline: late submissions will not be considered.
Authors without access to duplication facilities may submit a single
copy of each.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 10, 1994.
Accepted papers (16 pages in the LNCS format) will be due June 17,
1994.

The cover page of the submission should include the title, the
abstract, and for all authors, the name, address, phone number, fax
number, and e-mail when available.  Each submission must include as
the second page a clear statement of the issues, a summary of the main
results, and an explanation of their significance and relevance to the
conference, all phrased for the non-specialist.  Technical
developments, directed to the specialist, should follow starting on
the third page. The whole paper should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS
LaTeX Format.  Papers must be in English, clearly written, and provide
sufficient explanations to allow the program committee to assess the
merits of the paper.  References and comparisons with related work
should be included.  Proofs, if omitted in the paper, must appear in
an additional appendix for which there is no space limit.  Submissions
departing significantly from these guidelines run a high risk of
rejection.

The results in the abstract must be unpublished, and not submitted for
publication elsewhere, including other refereed conferences.  All
authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign copyright release
forms, and one author of each accepted paper will be expected to
present the paper at the conference.

People planning to attend CCL are kindly requested to send a note as
early as possible to the conference chair in order to help estimate
the facilities needed for the conference.  For further announcements,
contact the publicity chair.

CCL'94 will invite 5 lecturers,
Max Dauchet (Symbolic constraints and tree automata),
Dexter Kozen (Set constraints and logic programming),
Helmut Simonis (Applications of constraint logic programming), 
Gert Smolka (Concurrent constraint programming), and
Wayne Snyder (Constraints in automated deduction).

PAPER SUBMISSION: 5 hard copies of a full paper and 16 additional
copies of the cover page and second page should be received by 

		March 25, 1994 by the program chair.  

This is a FIRM deadline: late submissions will not be considered.
Authors without access to duplication facilities may submit a single
copy of each.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by May 10, 1994.
Accepted papers (16 pages in the LNCS format) will be due June 17,
1994.

The cover page of the submission should include the title, the
abstract, and for all authors, the name, address, phone number, fax
number, and e-mail when available.  Each submission must include as
the second page a clear statement of the issues, a summary of the main
results, and an explanation of their significance and relevance to the
conference, all phrased for the non-specialist.  Technical
developments, directed to the specialist, should follow starting on
the third page. The whole paper should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS
LaTeX Format.  Papers must be in English, clearly written, and provide
sufficient explanations to allow the program committee to assess the
merits of the paper.  References and comparisons with related work
should be included.  Proofs, if omitted in the paper, must appear in
an additional appendix for which there is no space limit.  Submissions
departing significantly from these guidelines run a high risk of
rejection.

The results in the abstract must be unpublished, and not submitted for
publication elsewhere, including other refereed conferences.  All
authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign copyright release
forms, and one author of each accepted paper will be expected to
present the paper at the conference.

People planning to attend CCL are kindly requested to send a note as
early as possible to the conference chair in order to help estimate
the facilities needed for the conference.  For further announcements,
contact the publicity chair.

Constraints in Computational Logics (CCL) is a new conference sponsored by 
the ESPRIT WORKING GROUP ``Construction of Computational Logics''.

The past two decades have seen a proliferation of different programming 
styles: functional, logical, constraints based, object-oriented, among others.
More recently, it has been recognized that these styles complement rather 
than exclude each others by being suitable for particular problem domains.
As a consequence, combining programming paradigms has emerged as a significant
research direction of its own, and constraints have often been used as a
glue for these combinations. 

CCL aims to attract high quality original papers covering theoretical and
practical issues in this direction of combining and extending programming 
paradigms preferably (but not exclusively) by using constraints. Suggested, 
but not exclusive, topics of interest include: 
symbolic constraints, set constraints, numerical constraints, 
constraints for knowledge representation and processing,
use of constraints for type checking and program analysis, 
multi-paradigm programming, abstract properties of combined calculi,
combinations of computational logics,
constraints in rewriting, deduction, and symbolic computations, 
working systems.

CCL'94 will invite 5 lecturers,
Max Dauchet (Symbolic constraints and tree automata),
Dexter Kozen (Set constraints and logic programming),
Helmut Simonis (Applications of constraint logic programming), 
Gert Smolka (Concurrent constraint programming), and
Wayne Snyder (Constraints in automated deduction).

{\bf Paper submission}: 5 hard copies of a full paper and 16 additional 
copies of the cover page and second page should be
{\bf received} by {\bf March 25, 1994} by the {\bf program chair}.
{\sl This is a FIRM deadline: late submissions will not be considered.}
Authors without access to duplication facilities may submit a single
copy of each.  Authors will be notified of acceptance
by May 10, 1994.  Accepted papers (16 pages in the LNCS format)
will be due June 17, 1994.

The cover page of the submission should include the title, the abstract, and
for all authors, the name, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail 
when available.
Each submission must include as the second page a clear statement 
of the issues, a summary of the main results, and an explanation 
of their significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the
non-specialist.
Technical developments, directed to the specialist, should 
follow starting on the third page. The whole paper
should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS LaTeX Format.
Papers must be in English, clearly written, and provide sufficient 
explanations to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the 
paper.  References and comparisons with related work should be included.
Proofs, if omitted in the paper, must appear in an additional appendix 
for which there is no space limit.
Submissions departing significantly from these guidelines run a high risk
of rejection.

The results in the abstract must be unpublished, and not submitted
for publication elsewhere, including other refereed
conferences.  All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign
copyright release forms, and one author of each accepted paper will be
expected to present the paper at the conference.

Constraints in Computational Logics (CCL) is a new conference sponsored by
the ESPRIT WORKING GROUP ``Construction of Computational Logics''.

The past two decades have seen a proliferation of different programming
styles: functional, logical, constraints based, object-oriented, among others.
More recently, it has been recognized that these styles complement rather
than exclude each others by being suitable for particular problem domains.
As a consequence, combining programming paradigms has emerged as a significant
research direction of its own, and constraints have often been used as a
glue for these combinations.

CCL aims to attract high quality original papers covering theoretical and
practical issues in this direction of combining and extending programming
paradigms preferably (but not exclusively) by using constraints. Suggested,
but not exclusive, topics of interest include:
symbolic constraints, set constraints, numerical constraints,
constraints for knowledge representation and processing,
use of constraints for type checking and program analysis,
multi-paradigm programming, abstract properties of combined calculi,
combinations of computational logics,
constraints in rewriting, deduction, and symbolic computations,
working systems.

CCL'94 will invite 5 lecturers,
Max Dauchet (Symbolic constraints and tree automata),
Dexter Kozen (Set constraints and logic programming),
Helmut Simonis (Applications of constraint logic programming),
Gert Smolka (Concurrent constraint programming), and
Wayne Snyder (Constraints in automated deduction).

{\bf Paper submission}: 5 hard copies of a full paper and 16 additional
copies of the cover page and second page should be
{\bf received} by {\bf March 25, 1994} by the {\bf program chair}.
{\sl This is a FIRM deadline: late submissions will not be considered.}
Authors without access to duplication facilities may submit a single
copy of each.  Authors will be notified of acceptance
by May 10, 1994.  Accepted papers (16 pages in the LNCS format)
will be due June 17, 1994.

The cover page of the submission should include the title, the abstract, and
for all authors, the name, address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail
when available.
Each submission must include as the second page a clear statement
of the issues, a summary of the main results, and an explanation
of their significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the
non-specialist.
Technical developments, directed to the specialist, should
follow starting on the third page. The whole paper
should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS LaTeX Format.
Papers must be in English, clearly written, and provide sufficient
explanations to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the
paper.  References and comparisons with related work should be included.
Proofs, if omitted in the paper, must appear in an additional appendix
for which there is no space limit.
Submissions departing significantly from these guidelines run a high risk
of rejection.

The results in the abstract must be unpublished, and not submitted
for publication elsewhere, including other refereed
conferences.  All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign
copyright release forms, and one author of each accepted paper will be
expected to present the paper at the conference.

People planning to attend CCL are kindly requested to send a note
as early as possible to the {\bf conference chair}
in order to help estimate the facilities needed for the conference.
For further announcements, contact the {\bf publicity chair}.
