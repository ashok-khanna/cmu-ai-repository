          First Announcement and Call for Papers

_____________________________________________________________



General Information:
    Continuing   the   tradition   of   previous   EWSL   and
    ECML  conferences,  ECML-95 provides  the major  European
    forum  for presenting the latest advances in the area  of
    Machine Learning.

Program:
    The  scientific  program  will  include  invited   talks,
    presentations   of  accepted  papers,  poster  and   demo
    sessions.       ECML-95  will   be  followed   by   MLNet
    familiarization  workshops for which a separate call  for
    proposals  will  be published  (contact  mlnet@computing-
    science.aberdeen.ac.uk).

Research areas:
    Submissions   are  invited  in   all  areas  of   Machine
    Learning, including, but not limited to:

     abduction                        analogy
     applications of machine learning automated discovery
     case-based learning              comput. learning theory
     explanation-based learning       inductive learning
     inductive logic programming      genetic algorithms
     learning and problem solving     multistrategy learning
     reinforcement learning           representation change
     revision and restructuring

    Papers  will  be  evaluated  with  respect  to  technical
    soundness,   significance,   originality   and   clarity.
    Papers will either be accepted as full papers  (presented
    at plenary sessions,  published  as full  papers in  the
    proceedings)  or posters (presented  at poster  sessions,
    published as extended abstracts).
