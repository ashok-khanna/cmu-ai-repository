The Sixth International  Conference  on Theoretical  and Methodological
Issues  in Machine  Translation  (TMI95)  will be held from July 5 to 7
1995 at the University  of Leuven, Belgium.  It will precede  the Fifth
edition of the MT Summit,  hosted by the EC in Luxembourg  from July 10
to 14.
TMI95 will focus on three major topics: computational semantics for MT,
MT of spoken language,  and the use of sublanguage/controlled  language
for MT.

Paper submission and deadlines:
-------------------------------

As a novelty  for  TMI,  two  kinds  of papers  can  be submitted:

1. high-quality topical papers focussing on (but not limited to) the broad
   domains of
        - computational  semantics  for MT
        - MT for spoken language
        - the use of sublanguage or controlled language for MT

1.1 Six copies of topical papers should be submitted by JANUARY 15 1995.
    The papers should respect the following conventions:
        - single column, double-spaced, point size 12 for running text
          (figures, annexes, references can deviate from this)
        - maximum length: 20 pages including figures and references
          (about 5000 words)
        - they must be in English
        - they must contain a 100-150 word abstract

1.2 Papers  will  be reviewed  by international  experts  in the field.
    Notification of acceptance will be sent by APRIL 15 1995.

1.3 Camera-ready  copy for the proceedings  (without  page  numbering!)
    should be received by MAY 15 1995.

1.4 E-mail submissions should be sent in LaTeX-format to
    tmi-subm@ccl.kuleuven.ac.be.
    Proper style files will be made available via ftp and WWW in
    due time.

2. short progress notes reporting on ongoing research, possibly
   accompanied by a demonstration (no commercial systems)

2.1 Six copies of progress notes should be submitted by JANUARY 15 1995.
    The following conventions apply:
        - single column, double-spaced, point size 12 for running text
          (figures, annexes, references can deviate from this)
        - maximum length: 8 pages including figures and references
          (about 2000 words)
        - they must be in English
        - they must contain a 50-100 word abstract

   Progress notes can also be sent via e-mail, provided they are
   in LaTeX-format. Style files for this will also be made
   available.

2.2 Papers  will  be reviewed  by international  experts  in the field.
    Notification of acceptance will be sent by APRIL 15 1995.

2.3 Progress notes will not be included in the proceedings; the authors
    are kindly invited to distribute copies of the accepted notes at the
    conference.
