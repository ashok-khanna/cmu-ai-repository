                           MICRONEURO 94  

                The Fourth International Conference
              on Microelectronics for Neural Networks
                         and Fuzzy Systems
  
                 Torino (I), September 26-28, 1994  
                       FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS  


This conference is the fourth in a series of international conferences
dedicated to all aspects of hardware implementations of Neural Networks
and Fuzzy Systems. 
MICRONEURO has emerged as the only international forum devoted
specifically to all hardware implementation aspects, giving particular
weight to those interdisciplinary issues which affect the design of
Neural and Fuzzy hardware directly. 


TOPICS 

The conference program will focus upon all aspects of hardware
implementations of Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems and their
applications in the real world. Topics will concentrate upon the
following fields:

 - Analog and mixed-mode implementations 
 - Digital implementations 
 - Optical systems 
 - Pulse-Stream computation 
 - Weightless Neural systems 
 - Neural and Fuzzy hardware systems 
 - Interfaces with external world 
 - Applications of dedicated hardware 
 - VLSI-friendly Neural algorithms 
 - New technologies for Neural and Fuzzy Systems 

Selection criteria will be based also on technical relevance, novelty
of the approach and on availability of performance measurements for the 
system/device.


INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS 

All submitted material (written in English) will be refereed and should
be typed on A4 paper, 1-1/2 spaced, 12 point font, 160x220 mm text size.
All accepted material will appear in the proceedings. 

PAPERS should not exceed 10 pages including figures and text. 
Also reports on EARLY INNOVATIVE IDEAS will be considered for presentation.
In this case the submission should be a short description of the novel
idea, not exceeding 6 pages in length, and it must be clearly marked
``Innovative Idea''.

The most interesting papers and ideas will be published in a special
issue of IEEE MICRO.


SUBMISSIONS 

Six copies of final manuscripts, written according to the above 
requirements, shall be submitted to the Program Chairman.
Submissions arriving late or significantly departing from length
guidelines, or papers published elsewhere will be returned without
review. Electronic versions of the submission (possibly in LATEX
format) are kindly welcome.


DEADLINES 

Submission of paper and/or ideas        May 30, 1994 
Notification of acceptance              July 15, 1994  


THE WORKSHOP VENUE 

The venue of MICRONEURO '94 is Torino, the historic and beautiful center 
of Piemonte. The town is surrounded by the highest mountains in Europe 
and by beautiful hills and landscapes. The region is also famous for 
its excellent wines.
 
MICRONEURO '94 will be held at the Politecnico di Torino.
The venue is conveniently located close to
the town centre, with many restaurants and cafes close by.
