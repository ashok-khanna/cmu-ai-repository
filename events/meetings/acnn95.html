The sixth Australian conference on neural networks will be held in Sydney on
February 6th - 8th 1995 at the University of Sydney.  ACNN'95 is the annual
national meeting of the Australian neural network community. It is a
multi-disciplinary meeting and seeks contributions from Neuroscientists,
Engineers, Computer Scientists, Mathematicians, Physicists and Psychologists.

ACNN'95 will feature a number of invited speakers. The program will include
presentations and poster sessions. Proceedings will be printed and distributed
to the attendees.  

The posters will be displayed for a significant period of time, and time will
be allocated for authors to be present at their poster in the conference
program.  

Software demonstrations will be possible for authors. SparcStations, DEC
Stations and PCs will be available in an adjacent laboratory for these
demonstrations.  


Invited Keynote Speaker

ACNN'95 will feature a number of keynote speakers, including Dr Larry Jackel,
AT&T Bell Laboratories and Dr Edmund Rolls, Oxford University. 


Pre-Conference Workshops

Pre-Conference Workshops covering basic introductions to neural computing,
neuroscience, applications and implementations will be held. A separate flyer
describing the workshops will be issued at a later date.   


Workshop on Industrial Application of Neural Computing

The Warren Centre for Advanced Engineering will be organising a workshop on
industrial application of neural computing. A separate information sheet will
be issued.  


Submission Categories

The major categories for paper submissions include, but are not restricted to:

1.	Neuroscience: Integrative function of neural networks in vision,
	Audition, Motor, Somatosensory and Autonomic functions; Synaptic
	function; Cellular information processing;  

2.	Theory: Learning; Generalisation; Complexity; Scaling; Stability;
	Dynamics; 

3.	Implementation: Hardware implementation of neural nets; Analog and
	digital VLSI implementation; Optical implementation;  

4.	Architectures and Learning Algorithms: New architectures and learning
	algorithms; Hierarchy; Modularity; Learning pattern sequences;
	Information integration;  

5.	Cognitive Science and AI: Computational models of perception and
	pattern recognition; Memory; Concept formation; Problem solving and
	reasoning; Visual and auditory attention; Language acquisition and
	production; Neural network implementation of expert systems;   

6.	Applications: Application of neural nets to signal processing and
	analysis; Pattern recognition: Speech, Machine vision; Motor control;
	Robotics; Forecast; Medical.  


Initial Submission of Papers

As this is a multi-disciplinary meeting, papers are required to be
comprehensible to an informed researcher outside the particular stream of
the author in addition to the normal requirements of technical merit.  

Papers should be submitted as close as possible to final form and must not
exceed four single A4 pages (2-column format). The first page should include
the title and abstract, and should leave space for, but not include the
authors' names and affiliations. A cover page should be supplied giving the
title of the paper, the name and affiliation of each author, together with the
postal address, the e-mail address, and the phone and fax numbers of a
designated contact author. The type font should be no smaller than 10 point
except in footnotes. A serif font such as Times or New Century Schoolbook is
preferred.        

Four copies of the paper and the front cover sheet should be sent to: 
	
	Agatha Shotam
	ACNN'95 Secretariat
	University of Sydney
	Department of Electrical Engineering
	NSW 2006
	Australia

Each manuscript should clearly indicate submission category (from the six
listed) and author preference for oral or poster presentations. This initial
submission must be on hard copy to reach us by Friday, 2 September 1994.
