       THE SECOND SWEDISH CONFERENCE ON CONNECTIONISM
              The Connectionist Research Group
                University of Skovde, SWEDEN

                      March 2-4, 1995

SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

Understanding  neural  information   processing   properties
characterizes  the field of connectionism, also known as Ar-
tificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The rapid growth, expansion and great popularity of  connec-
tionism  is  motivated  by  the  new  way of approaching and
understanding the problems of artificial  intelligence,  and
its applicability in many real-world applications.

There is  a number of subfields of connectionism among which
we distinguish the following.

The importance of a  "Theory  of  connectionism"  cannot  be
overstressed.  The  interest in theoretical analysis of neu-
ronal models, and the complex dynamics of network  architec-
tures  grows rapidly.       It is often argued that abstract
neural network models are best understood by analysing their
computational  properties  with  respect to their biological
counterparts. A clear  theoretical  approach  to  developing
neural  models  also provides insight in dynamics, learning,
functionality and probabilities of  different  connectionist
networks.

"Cognitive connectionism" is bridging the  gap  between  the
theory  of  connectionism and cognitive science by modelling
higher  order  brain  functions  from  psychology  by  using
methods  offered  by  connectionist  models. The findings of
this field are often evaluated by  their  neuropsychological
validity and not by their functional applicability.

Sometimes the field of connectionism is referred to  as  the
"new  AI". Its applicability in AI has spawned a belief that
AI will benefit from a good understanding of neural informa-
tion  processing  capabilities.  The subfield "Connectionism
and artificial intelligence" is also concerned with the dis-
tinction between connectionist and symbolic representations.

The wide  applicability  and  problem-solving  abilities  of
neural  networks  are  exposed  in  "Real-world  computing".
Robotics, vision, speech and neural hardware are some of the
topics in this field.

"The philosophy of connectionism"  is  concerned  with  such
diverse  questions  as  the  mind-body problem and relations
between distributed representations, their semantics and im-
plications for intelligent behaviour.

Experimental studies in "Neurobiology" have implications  on
the  validity and design of new, artificial neural architec-
tures. This branch of connectionism addresses topics such as
self-organisation,  modelling  of  cortex,  and  associative
memory models.

A number of internationally renowned keynote  speakers  will
be  invited  to  give  plenary  talks on the subjects listed
above.
