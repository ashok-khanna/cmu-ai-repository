				Call for Papers
	       Workshop on Physics and Computation, PhysComp `94,
			     This Decade and Beyond
		     November 17 - 20, 1994, Dallas, Texas
		   Sponsored by Dallas IEEE Computer Society
			     Sponsored by ONR/ARPA
	       Corporate Sponsor: Texas Instruments Incorporated

The Workshop on Physics and Computation, PhysComp  `94 will seek to explore the
intimate relationship emerging  between Modern Physics  and Computation Theory.
One commonly  held view is that  information laws are dependent  on the laws of
physics.  Another emerging  view is  that the  universe would not  work without
information primitives underlying physical laws.   Both of these views conclude
that  physics and  information/computation   are  linked together  at   a  very
fundamental level.  Understanding the convergence   of computation and  physics
will lead to a  better understanding of using  physical mechanisms as computing
engines, and also  lead to  a  better understanding   of  how the  universe  is
organized.    This field will  become   increasingly important to the computing
industry as   the   post-shrink era  approaches  and   the  energy consumption,
complexity, and computational horsepower  requirements  continue to exceed  the
computing engines we are able to design or build.  This workshop will emphasize
solutions that are applicable during this decade as well as longer term ideas.

The first general conference on the Physics of Computation  was held in 1981 at
MIT and  Richard Feynman   was the  keynote  speaker.   The  papers  from  that
conference were published in  the  1982 International Journal for   Theoretical
Physics, Vol 21, April, June, and December issues.  The Workshop on Physics and
Computation,  PhysComp `92, held in  Dallas  in October  2-4, 1992,  was a long
awaited reawakening of the field and 100 people  attended from 7 countries. The
Keynote speaker for PhysComp '92  was Rolf Landauer of   IBM, a pioneer in  the
field. Proceedings of the PhysComp `92 are available thru IEEE Computer Society
Press and an   electronic mailing list  has been  established (for subscription
information send email to physics.computation-request@hc.ti.com).

PhysComp `94 has  been extended an  additional day over  PhysComp  `92 to allow
invited panel sessions speakers and submitted papers that discuss architectures
for  nano-electronic systems.   Papers   are requested  on other  physics   and
computing topics  such as limits of  computing, practical reversible computers,
nano-electronics, energetics of computing, Cellular Automata, analog computing,
quantum  cryptography, optical  computing, molecular  computing, quantum logic,
etc.  Generally we are interested in papers that unify Computation (Algorithms,
Architecture,  Information   Theory,   Automatic  Learning,  Tele/Communication
Theory,  Simulation, etc) with Physics  (Discrete  models, Entropy, Complexity,
Quantum  Theory, Thermodynamics,  Energy/mass, Relativity, Gravity,  etc).  The
goal of this workshop is to establish  stronger links between participants from
various backgrounds as well   as to educate  professionals interested  in these
topics.

The   keynote speaker  for  PhysComp  '94   will  be  Professor Carver Mead  of
California Institute    of Technology in    Pasadena.  His  current  focus  and
teachings are in the area of VLSI design,  ultra-concurrent systems, physics of
computation, and the construction of silicon models of neural systems.

SUBMISSION: Please surface mail five copies of your preliminary paper (10 pages
maximum) or 5 page extended abstract by Monday May 23, 1994 to:

   Wolfgang Porod                            PhysComp `94 Program Co-chairman

Notification  of  acceptance  will be  mailed  by  Friday  July  1,  1994.  The
technical committee will  group  submissions into relevant topics,   and select
papers and panel  members.  Papers will be  accepted  for long talks  and short
talks.  Panel sessions  and  poster sessions  may  also be organized   based on
papers submitted.  The proceedings will be  prepared thru IEEE Computer Society
Press in time to be distributed at the workshop.

REGISTRATION: A block of rooms is being reserved and all  meetings will be held
at the Harvey Hotel in Addison, TX. Full registration details will be mailed at
a later date.  The room rate will  be $59 single/$69  double.  The workshop fee
will be $200, payment by US check or credit card.  Transportation to the hotel:
Super-shuttle or Taxi.  Free hotel shuttles for transportation in Addison.
