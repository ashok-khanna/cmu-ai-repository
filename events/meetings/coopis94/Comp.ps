                                CALL FOR PAPERS

                       SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                         COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
                                  (CoopIS-94)
      Formerly "Intelligent & Cooperative Information Systems (ICICIS)"


                                May 17-20, 1994
                       Royal York Hotel, Toronto, Canada


      Supported by the Information Technology Research Centre of Ontario
   In cooperation with IEEE CS, ACM SIGOIS (pending approval), and ACM SIGMOD



TSUNAMI - THE TIDAL WAVE IS HERE
--------------------------------

Within most organizations, worldwide, mission critical information
systems (ISs) already cooperate or are being converted to do so to
meet basic business requirements. Due to the lack of appropriate
concepts, techniques, and tools, this is being done using primitive
means thereby creating problems that will dwarf those of current
legacy information systems. This conference is devoted to addressing
this tidal wave facing the information systems community.



COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE CHALLENGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The paradigm for the next generation of ISs will involve large numbers
of ISs distributed over large, complex computer/communication
networks. This ranges from the vast and visionary Electronic
Superhighway, to the large and complex billing system of a telephone
company, an even to the small patient information system in a
one-doctor office. Such ISs will manage or have access to large
amounts of information and computing services. They will support
individual or collaborative human work. Computation will be conducted
concurrently over the network by software systems that range from
conventional to advanced application systems including expert systems,
and multiagent planning systems. Information and services will be
available in many forms through legacy and new information
repositories that support a host of information services.
Communication among component systems will be done in a centralized or
distributed fashion, using communication protocols that range from
conventional ones to those based on distributed AI. We call such next
generation ISs Cooperative Information Systems (CIS). Soon, the
operation of a one-doctor office may critically depend on its ISs'
ability to cooperate with foreign ISs not just for reimbursement
(i.e., required by insurance organizations) but also for patients
(e.g., exchanging information in medical crises). Demand for more
efficient processes and use of all resources will come from economic
and business conditions (e.g., competition, imperative for wider
marketplaces, and cooperation and distribution in the production of
goods and services) that have led to downsizing and re-engineering .
IS technology, one of the largest costs of many organizations, can be
the problem, or part of the solution. The demands are pervasive from
vast organizations to very small. The requirements span conventional
organizational and legal boundaries such as countries, companies
(e.g., virtual companies), disciplines (e.g., concurrent engineering
spanning a products entire life span). The CIS paradigm is evolving to
meet these demands thus raising challenges for the supporting
technologies.

Unlike previous major computing advances based on single technologies,
the CIS paradigm will evolve from the integration of many, currently
disjoint technologies. Database Systems will contribute information
management techniques, particularly for distributed or heterogeneous
databases, as well as efficient implementation techniques for
information bases.  Artificial Intelligence will contribute knowledge
representation and reasoning techniques, on the one hand, and
distributed problem solving and planning techniques in a multiagent
environment on the other. Operating Systems will contribute resource
management techniques over large distributed computer/communications
networks. Programming Languages will contribute languages and
type/object systems for cooperative programming.
Software/Knowledge/Information Engineering will contribute design and
development environments/shells and methodologies for CIS development
and evolution. Computer Communications will provide the necessary
underlying communication and interconnection technology. Other
relevant technologies include: Computer Supported Cooperative Work,
Distributed Computing, Organizational Computing, and Interoperability.
The challenge is to effectively combine these technologies and their
contributions to meet CIS requirements. A significant challenge is to
overcome the existing boundaries to achieve a common understanding of
the relevant issues.

CIS will become reality through research in concepts, methodologies,
techniques, and tools for the efficient - and transparent -
integration of computing resources that are accessible over large
computer/communications networks which may become indistinguishable
from the CISs themselves. More important is the technology transfer
and communication required between the significant, practical
situations, which exemplify the requirements, and the research
community that tries to address them. But most important is an
increased common understanding across the existing boundaries as to
the nature of the problems, the requirements, and adequate approaches
to address them.



THE CONFERENCE
--------------

The CoopIS-94 conference will provide a forum for the presentation and
dissemination of this research covering all aspects of CIS conception,
requirements, functionality, implementation, deployment, and
evolution.

The CoopIS-94 conference programme will include technical sessions,
invited presentations, panels, and tutorials that deal with CISs and
the integration of relevant technologies. In addition, CoopIS-94 plans
to host special sessions on the industrial applicability of CIS
technology. Further information about the conference and its programme
can be obtained from the General and Program Co-Chairs and by
anonymous FTP from ftp.gte.com (132.197.8.2) under directory
pub/coopis.

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS
-----------------------

Authors must clearly relate the contribution of their work to the
concept of CIS, rather than just describing aspects of a component
technology (e.g., state assumptions or definitions as to the nature of
CISs). Papers which illustrate their results in terms of an CIS
application or address technology integration issues leading to CISs
are particularly welcome.

Submission must be identified as one of three different categories:
visions, research, and experience. Vision papers should present
stimulating challenges, ideas, or visions that lead to exciting and
valuable CIS research directions. Vision papers will be evaluated with
respect to innovation, realizable applications and technologies, and
technical challenges posed (e.g., that do not currently admit of
solutions). Research papers should advance the state of the art of CIS
and will be evaluated using conventional scientific criteria.
Experience papers should describe the practical applications of CIS
concepts or methods. They will be evaluated in terms of lessons
learned, research issues raised, and solutions to realistic
challenges, such as those of legacy information systems.

Five copies of original and compelling unpublished papers up to 5000
words that are not under consideration for publication elsewhere
during the reviewing period should be sent to the appropriate
Programme Committee Co-Chair. Restricted electronic submission may be
acceptable. For instructions contact the American PC Co-Chair.
Submissions must include contact information (contact name, postal and
e-mail address, and phone number), a 100-word abstract, and explicitly
indicate the paper category (vision, research, or experience).

The edited proceedings of CoopIS-94 will appear as a book from a major
international publisher. Selected articles will be considered for
publication in the International Journal of Intelligent and
Cooperative Information Systems.
