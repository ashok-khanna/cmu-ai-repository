 Science, to be held July 5 - 29, 1994.

 The first three weeks of the Institute will feature courses at basic and ad-
 vanced levels in constituent disciplines of cognitive science. Participants
 may enroll in the courses for academic credit.  Each course will meet for a
 total of 15 hours and will carry 1 semester unit of credit. During the four
 weeks,  there will be a speaker series featuring some of the most prominent
 scholars in the cognitive science disciplines.  The fourth week will be de-
 voted to special workshops and seminars. July 5 is reserved for a welcoming
 reception and registration.

 Participants will include graduate and undergraduate students, faculty as-
 sociates, and researchers from business, industry, and government from the
 USA and around the world.  The Institute has received hundreds of requests
 for registration applications.  Thus,  to ensure a space at the Institute,
 please register early.    Only registered participants will have access to

           PARTICIPANT SYMPOSIA & WORKSHOPS (Revised Guidelines)


 Participant symposia will be scheduled during the weekends of 9-10, 16-17, and
 23-24  July).   All participants registered for a minimum of 1 week may submit
 1-page abstracts of papers to be presented during the open sessions that will
 be organized on these dates. (The earlier requirement to supply long abstracts
 has  now  been  dropped.)   Each participant whose paper is accepted  will be
 awarded a slot of 40 minutes (to include both talk and discussion).
  
 In addition to these single-paper presentations, the weekend sessions will ac-
 commodate also special workshops organized by registrants on cognitive-science
 related themes.  Individuals and groups of participants are encouraged to for-
 mulate ideas for such workshops,   which will typically consist of a series of
 papers stretching over a 2 to 3-hour period.   It is our intention to keep the
 rules for such workshops as flexible as possible.   They might include special
 tutorials, panel-sessions, as well as groups of individual talks.   Organizers
 of workshops will receive scheduling and promotional assistance as necessary.

 Please note that the deadlines for submission have been adjusted as follows:

 1. deadline for receipt of one-page abstracts of single papers: 30 April 1994.

 2. deadline for receipt of workshop proposals: 30 April 1994.

 (Proposals  for  participant workshops  should include  title,  a 10-line
 description of the topic, together with a list of names of organizers and
 of intended participants (if known).)

 Only submissions to participant symposia that meet these deadlines will be
 included within the official FISI participant symposium handbook.  Subject
 to  time-table  considerations,  we may also accept additional submissions
 received after these dates. Early submissions will be given priority.

                       INFORMATION ON FINANCIAL AID


 Although the official deadline for applications for financial aid for the
 Summer Institute in Cognitive Science has now passed, we will continue to
 process further such applications.  However, applications received before
 the deadline will be given priority.
 
 Financial Aid Form D should be filled out as completely as possible.   If
 there are sections of the form that do not apply to you (for example, be-
 cause you have no GRE scores),  please leave these sections blank and ex-
 plain why you are doing so in an accompanying note,   enclosing all docu-
 mentation that you think relevant.
 
 It is anticipated that the Organizing Committee will, unfortunately, have
 very limited resources of its own  to aid deserving candidates  to attend
 the Institute. And decisions about awards from this source cannot be made
 before April.   However, we will do all we can to help applicants receive
 support from third-party sources (and we have already had some success in
 this respect,  specifically for US minorities,  and for persons  applying
 from outside the US).  
 
 People  who believe they may be eligible  for assistance from third-party
 sources  or who would like any clarification  or advice  on financial aid
 should contact Barry Smith as soon as possible:

        Dr. Barry Smith
        Department of Philosophy
        SUNY Buffalo
        Buffalo, NY 14260
        USA

        PHISMITH@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu
        716-645-2463

 We will not normally send back acknowledgment of receipt  of financial aid
 applications.  If you would like an acknowledgment,  please send a request
 to Barry Smith at his address above  (enclosing,  if possible,  a stamped,
 self-addressed envelope).
 
 Applicants from former USSR countries should also contact:

        Prof. Robert Van Valin
        Department of Linguistics
        SUNY Buffalo
        Buffalo, NY 14260

 FISI-CS                   COURSE REQUEST FORM                         FORM B

 Each course will meet for a total of 15  hours  and  carry  1  semester
 credit  unit.   Your Institute Registration Fee of $750.00 (or $1800.00
 corporate) covers up to 3 credits (3 courses for 1  credit  each).   If
 you  wish to take additional courses for credit, there is an additional
 fee of $150.00 for each credit beyond the original 3.

 For each course that you list, please check one of the columns indicat-
 ing  whether  you are seeking graduate credit, undergraduate credit, or
 no credit for that course.  If these columns are left blank, it will be
 assumed that you are not taking the course for credit (No Credit is the
 default).

 Please consult the List of Courses for the 2-digit Course Identification No.
 and the Official  Course  Title.  We also suggest that you carefully review
 the Course Schedule in order to avoid registering for courses that will  be
 held simultaneously. Do not register for courses listed under the same time
 slot.   Since there are 7 time slots (4 on a M-W-F schedule and 3 on a T-TH
 schedule), the maximum number of courses that you can register for is 7.
