************************* CALL FOR PAPERS************************

During the

             13th World Computer Congress
                   IFIP Congress '94

taking place in Hamburg (Germany) from August 31 to September  2,
a one day workshop (GI Fachgespr"ach)

     "Disjunctive Logic Programming and Disjunctive Databases"

will be organized. The success of the Logic Programming  Paradigm
gives  rise to a closer connection between the areas of "Program-
ming" and "Databases". It turns out that general deductive  tech-
niques (including full first-order logic) can be used efficiently
in both disciplines.  While in the area of programming  languages
one  investigates  semantics  for indefinite and disjunctive pro-
grams (looking for  suitable  query-answering  mechanisms),  such
programs might be used in the area of databases to formulate both
deductive tasks and integrity constraints. Presentations and dis-
cussions  are  invited  preferably  on the topics just mentioned.
This includes (but is not limited to): semantics  of  disjunctive
logic  programs,  proof-theoretic approaches for disjunctive pro-
grams, fixpoint-iteration, non-monotonic aspects  of  programming
and knowledge representation.

INVITED TALKS will be given by:

Donald Loveland
Francois Bry
Teodor Przymusinski

The workshop will be held on August 31. Attendees have to  regis-
ter to the conference.

Four copies of a paper (extended abstracts) of  no  more  than  8
pages  (German  DIN A4 format) should be submitted to the address
given below according to the following deadline:

                   Submission deadline:        March 15
                   Notification of acceptance: April 15
                   Camera-ready copy due:      May 31

Accepted papers  will be published in informal workshop  proceed-
ings,  available  at the conference. Selected papers will be pub-
lished in the official Springer proceedings.
