Greetings!
   I am in the process of organizing a session on AI in simulation 
   (air, space, land, and sea) for AEROTECH'94. AEROTECH is a yearly 
   conference organized by SAE (The engineering society for advancing 
   mobility). This year the conference will be held in Los Angeles, CA 
   from oct 3-6, 1994. This conference charges no registration fee for 
   authors presenting the paper. If you or any one you know is interested 
   in contributing to this session, please contact me at:
