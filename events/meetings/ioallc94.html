CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION-ORIENTED APPROACHES
TO LOGIC, LANGUAGE AND COMPUTATION
(4th Conference on Situation Theory and its Applications)

Saint Mary's College of California, Moraga, California, USA

Conference: June 12--15, 1994
Instructional workshops: June 8--11, 1994

In the past few years, there has been a growing sense of
convergence in information-based work in the study of
language and logic. Situation theory, domain theory, and
linear logic, for example, are increasingly seen as having
common underlying intuitions and motivations. For this
reason, it has been decided to broaden the focus of the
Situation Theory and its Applications conference from
situation theory, per se, to the general study of logic,
language and computation from an informational
perspective.

A special feature of this year's conference is a symposium
on visual reasoning, organized by Jon Barwise and John
Etchemendy.

=============================================================
FEES
=============================================================

Registration fee: regular participants $150, full-time
students $100.

Workshop and conference accommodation: 8 nights, full board:
$500 (single room); $400 (shared double room, cost per person).

Conference accommodation only: 5 nights, full board:
$320 (single room); $250 (shared double room, cost per person).

Meals only: 5 days (June 9, 10, 13, 14, 15) $105; 3 days (June 13,
14, 15) $63. (This plan covers breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
No other meals-only plans are available through the conference
organizers.)

Full board does not include lunch on the weekend.

These are special, conference rates, and are less than half the
cost of accommodation and meals off-campus in the area. The
conference organizers regret that they cannot make special
accommodation arrangements (other than special dietary
requirements, such as vegetarian). In particular, participants
who wish to arrive a day later or depart a day earlier will
still have to pay the same amount.

Workshop costs:	1 course:	$150
			2 courses:	$250
			3 courses:	$300

THE VENUE
=============================================================

Saint Mary's College of California is located in Moraga, a small
township nestled in the Oakland hills, ten miles to the east of
Berkeley. Public bus transportation connects the campus to
the train station in the nearby town of Lafayette, with regular
trains to and from San Francisco (BART).  The area is extremely
picturesque, quiet, and safe, with lots of activities to offer
accompanying persons not involved in the conference itself.
The June weather is normally sunny and warm, with daytime
temperatures in the 70F to 90F range. Rain in June is extremely
unlikely.

=============================================================
ORGANIZATION

Program committee: Dag Westerstahl (chair, U Stockholm),
Elisabet Engdahl (U Edinburgh), John Etchemendy (Stanford U),
Jerry Seligman (U Amsterdam), Hidetosi Sirai (Chukyo U).
