              INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL THREE CONFERENCES

Papers must be received by December 10, 1993.  Papers will
be reviewed by senior researchers in the field, and all
authors will be informed of the decisions at the end of the
review proces.  All accepted papers will be published in the
Conference Proceedings.  Six copies (one original and five
copies) of the paper must be submitted.  Original must be
camera ready, on 8.5x11-inch white paper, two-column format
in Times or similar fontstyle, 10 points or larger with one
half inch margins on all four sides.  Authors are encouraged
to use the WCCI LaTex template with the IEEEtran.sty style
sheet.  (The format is similar to that used in IEEE
Transactions).  These documents can be ftp'd using the
following instructions:

     ftp ftp.ai.sri.com
     login: anonymous
     Password: < Use your e-mail address as the Password >
     (An SRI information document will scroll.
        Afterwards, type ... )
     cd pub/ieee
     (If you would like a list of the contents, type `ls')

The following documents are available to ftp:   
     1. IEEEtran.sty        The IEEE Style Sheet
     2. WCCI-short.tex      Short LaTex template
     3. WCCI-long.tex       Longer LaTex template
     4. read.me             WCCI Information

Do not fold or staple the original camera-ready copy of your
submitted paper.  Four pages are encouraged.  The paper must
not exceed six pages including figures, tables, and
references, and should be written in English.  Centered at
the top of the first page should be the complete title,
author name(s), affiliation(s) and mailing address(es).  In
the accompanying letter, the following information must be
included:

     1) Full title of paper,
     2) Corresponding authors name, address, telephone and
        fax numbers,
     3) First and second choices of technical session,
     4) Preference for oral or poster presentation, and 
     5) Presenter's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

Mail papers to (and/or obtain further information from):

     World Congress on Computational Intelligence
     Meeting Management
     2603 Main Street, Suite # 690
     Irvine, California 92714
