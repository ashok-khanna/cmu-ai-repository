SCOPE:
The central theme of the 2nd IEEE Mediterranean Symposium is twofold:
Control and Automation. The Symposium topics cover a wide area from Modern 
System Theory, Intelligent and Autonomous Control,  Robotics and Automation,
and Applications.
The objective of the Symposium is to present and discuss recent theoretical 
developments in Control and Automation, as well as their application to
industrial automation problems. The aim is to bring together researchers from
academia and industry, to discuss and identify open problems and future 
research directions in this area.

TOPICS:
Symposium topics include, but are not limited to: 
Modeling Techniques, Linear and Nonlinear Systems, 
Intelligent Control Systems, Autonomous Control Systems, 
Neural Networks, Discrete Event Dynamic Systems, Adaptive Control, 
Stochastic Control, Numerical Methods, Fuzzy Logic, Robotics, 
Multisensory Robotic Systems, Planning and Scheduling, CIM and FMS Systems,
Quality Control, Computer Control, Real-Time Software, Man-Machine Systems.

PAPER SUBMISSION:
FIVE copies of the  *** full paper *** in final form must
be received for peer review by the Program Chairman by JANUARY 31, 1994.
Papers must follow a two column format, be written using a 10-12 point
font and must be typed in single space. Each paper should not exceed eight
