                       PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

                             CAIA '94 Advance Program

                           The Tenth IEEE Conference on
                     Artificial Intelligence for Applications

                                 March 1-4, 1994
                                Marriott Riverwalk
                                San Antonio, Texas

                               CONFERENCE OVERVIEW

    For nine consecutive years, the  IEEE  Computer  Society's  Conference  on
    Artificial  Intelligence  for  Applications  has provided an international
    forum for the exchange  of  ideas,  techniques,  and  experiences  in  the
    application  of  AI  to  real-world  problems.  During this time, CAIA has
    established itself as a key conference for business and  technical  people
    who  want  to  keep  up  on the fast-changing word of commercial AI.  This
    year, the ninth annual CAIA will continue that tradition  by  providing  a
    provocative   mix   of  introductory,  intermediate  and  advanced  talks,
    tutorials, workshops, and panels. In addition, CAIA '94 has strived for  a
    new  balance  between  information  of  interest  to  AI  researchers  and
    information of interest to business and  commercial  people.  An  emerging
    theme of AI and information systems, including the Internet, reflects this
    balance.

    CAIA '94 starts with a full day of  workshops  and  tutorials.  The  three
    workshops  range from intelligent access to digital libraries, to business
    process re-engineering, to coordinated design, and will  provide  a  forum
    for  intense  communication between researchers and practitioners. The six
    half-day tutorials will provide succinct but detailed introductions into a
    variety of AI-related techniques and applications.

    CAIA '94 continues with three days of technical sessions. Each day  starts
    with one of the following plenary addresses:

      Shall We Reinvent AI and its Applications?
      Edward A. Feigenbaum, Stanford University

      Digital Libraries: Why People use Tools, not AI
      Ed Fox, Virginia Polytech

      Angels, Pinheads, and AI Technology Infusion
      Dr. Melvin Montemerlo, Program Manager for Automation, NASA Headquarters

    After each plenary address are technical sessions  in  three  tracks:  two
    paper  tracks  and  a  panel  track.  These  tracks  are  designed  to  be
    complementary and to appeal to  people  with  different  backgrounds.  The
    panels include such topics as "Smart Computers in Space", "AI and Business
    Applications", and "Intelligent User Interfaces".

    Finally, CAIA '94 will include many opportunities for informal discussion,
    including numerous breaks, a banquet and a reception with poster viewing.

                                  MARCH 1, 1994

    WORKSHOP 1: TECHNOLOGIES FOR BUSINESS PROCESS RE-ENGINEERING

      The increase in  competition,  customer  awareness,  and  ever  changing
      business  climate coupled with the failure of short-gap solutions (e.g.,
      restructuring/downsizing, diversification,  portfolio  management,  LBO,
      etc.)  has  forced  many  corporations to redesign business process in a
      fundamentally new way. A business process consists of all activities and
      agents  required from the conceptualization of a product to its delivery
      to customers and subsequent support. The task of  re-engineering  is  to
      design  the  activities themselves and thereby redesign the relationship
      between the activities and the agents.  Information technologies play  a
      central   role  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  re-engineering
      solutions. This workshop will bring together leaders,  researchers,  and
      developers  engaged in designing and delivering re-engineering solutions
      and share challenges faced and lessons learned.

    WORKSHOP 2: INTELLIGENT ACCESS TO ON-LINE DIGITAL LIBRARIES

      The rate of information production in our global society is taking place
      thousands  of  times  faster than our population growth. The linkages of
      high speed networks,  fiberized  telephone  lines,  and  large  capacity
      information  bases  will  create  digital libraries which is expected to
      provide many kinds of  information.  Such  information  reservoirs  when
      connected  to many others have the potential of giving birth to a global
      information repository. Due to their widely distributed, and diversified
      clientele,  these emerging libraries will require intelligent management
      of information. The  purpose  of  this  workshop  is  to  focus  on  how
      intelligent  browsing,  intelligent  data  management,  and  intelligent
      presentation systems will facilitate  the  operation  of  robust,  mass-
      scale, and large capacity digital libraries.

    WORKSHOP 3: COORDINATED DESIGN AND PLANNING

      Many proposals for functionality  are  being  made  in  the  domains  of
      Enterprise Integration (EI) and Concurrent Engineering (CE). At the same
      time many research claims are being  made  for  distributed  agent-based
      technologies  that  should  apply  to these domains. Yet the problem and
      solution spaces are as yet ill-defined. In this  workshop,  participants
      will  apply  their technologies to a simple problem: distributed meeting
      scheduling.  We believe that this problem is  simple  enough  to  permit
      analysis  of  the  problem  and  solution  spaces, yet complex enough to
      expose gaps in technologies needed for EI and CE.  The best papers  from
      this  workshop and a similar one are to be included in a planned book on
      this subject.

                             CAIA-94 TUTORIAL PROGRAM
                                  MARCH 1, 1994

    Tuesday, March 1, 1994, 8:30 - 12:00 noon

    TUTORIAL 1: SYMBOLIC AND NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACHES TO MACHINE LEARNING
      Haym Hirsh, Rutgers University

      This tutorial will survey  symbolic  and  neural-network  approaches  to
      machine learning. It will provide an overview of the major topics in the
      area, and  give  detailed  descriptions  of  some  of  the  better-known
      algorithms  (e.g., decision-tree methods, perceptrons, backpropagation),
      presenting them  in  a  single,  unified  light  that  highlights  their
      commonalities and relative strengths and weaknesses. After attending the
      tutorial, participants should understand how to use  these  methods  for
      their  own problems, and be able to understand the main problems, goals,
      and methods  being  addressed  by  researchers  today.  Further,  people
      already  familiar  with work in either area will learn about work in the
      other area and see both areas in a more uniform light.

    TUTORIAL 2: TRANSFORMING ORGANIZATIONS WITH ADVANCED COMPUTING
      David Bailey, Bailey Consulting

      Advanced computing offers organizations an unprecedented opportunity  to
      leverage  the  use  of  information technology to solve complex business
      problems. Many view it to be a key to competitive advantage and  process
      innovation.  In  order  to  be effective, advanced computing needs to be
      applied as part  of  a  visionary  information  strategy  that  directly
      supports and enables the business strategy.  This tutorial discusses the
      state of  the  software  industry  and  the  opportunities  provided  by
      advanced computing. It then summaries key advanced computing techniques,
      characterizing  their  capabilities,  costs,  and  benefits.   Next,   a
      practical  problem-driven approach to applying advanced computing within
      organizations is described. Practical considerations  and  case  studies
      are  then  discussed,  and  the tutorial concludes with a summary of key
      points.

    TUTORIAL 3: KNOWLEDGE BASE MANAGEMENT AND ITS APPLICATION
      Igor Jurisica  and  Huaiquing  Wang,  Department  of  Computer  Science,
      University of Toronto

      Knowledge based systems are now routinely used  in  thousands  of  "real
      world"  applications.  Most  such  applications involve relatively small
      knowledge bases, containing hundreds  rather  than  thousands  of  units
      (object,  rules,  frames).   Developing the next generation of knowledge
      based systems will require a technology  for  building,  accessing,  and
      managing very large knowledge bases, with potentially millions of units.
      Knowledge base management requires new techniques,  including  efficient
      implementations  of  inference  mechanisms  (terminological subsumption,
      deduction,  induction  and  abduction),  and  new  tools  for  knowledge
      acquisition,  knowledge  base validation, verification, and maintenance,
      as well as new architectures that accommodate a multi-user,  distributed
      environment.  This  tutorial  will provide a comprehensive review of the
      state-of-the-art in knowledge base management techniques and  commercial
      tools, as well as recent research results and on-going projects.  All of
      these will be presented from the  application  point  of  view  and  the
      actual  development  process  of  knowledge  based  applications will be
      stressed.

    March 1, 1994, 1:30 - 5:00 pm

    TUTORIAL 4: PROBABILISTIC REASONING
      John Lemmer, CTA Incorporated

      Increasingly applied AI has had to come to grips with the  uncertainties
      inherent in most knowledge applicable to real domains. The focus of this
      tutorial is how Probabilistic Reasoning fits  into  applied  AI.  First,
      Probability  will  be  brought  into sharp focus against a background of
      applications by considering it a generalization of "if...then" rules  of
      Expert   Systems,   and  compared  to  Fuzzy  Sets,  Possibility  Logic,
      Conditional Logic,  and  Dempster-Shafer  Theory,  the  other  principal
      alternatives  to Probability for quantitative management of uncertainty.
      The comparisons are based not on "good/bad?, but on "different". Then, a
      number  of  choices  withing  Probability  are  explained  and compared,
      including Bayes Nets, Triangulated Nets, Influence Diagrams, and  Causal
      Models. These choices are discussed in sufficient detail to reveal their
      different uses and their different implementation strategies.

    TUTORIAL 5: PUTTING EXPERT SYSTEMS/DBMSs COOPERATION INTO PRACTICE
      Chihab Hanachi, University Toulouse 1

      In many application domains the  actual  and  efficient  use  of  expert
      systems  relies  on  the proper use of data. Also, expert systems handle
      large  populations  of  facts,  so  that  accessing  and  managing   the
      underlying  data  becomes  a complex activity, as important as reasoning
      itself. It is then essential to use Data Base Management Systems (DBMSs)
      to   guarantee  efficient  access  to  the  data  and  appropriate  data
      management  (including  data   coherence,   data   sharing,   and   data
      distribution).  This  tutorial  will  help  the attendee in the tasks of
      implementing ES/DBMS integration, in  particular  with  identifying  the
      role of each component, choosing a software architecture, specifying the
      mechanisms  of  ES/DBMS   communication,   and   understanding   ES/DBMS
      communication and reasoning efficiency.

    TUTORIAL 6: PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION
      Angel R. Puerta, Stanford University,  and  Henrik  Eriksson,  Linkoping
      University

      This tutorial will develop a comprehensive view of  the  most  important
      principles  and  practical  issues  in  knowledge  acquisition.  We will
      present  the  theoretical  foundations  of  knowledge   acquisition   to
      establish  a  framework in which the attendee can understand and analyze
      how  the  theories  are  put  into  practice.  We  will  concentrate  on
      illustrating  problems  with computer-based knowledge-acquiistion tools,
      covering examples from early expert systems to  the  new  generation  of
      knowledge-based   systems   based   on  reusable  knowledge  components.
      Throughout the tutorial, we will emphasize the particular  issues,  such
      as human-computer interaction, that affect the design and development of
      knowledge acquistion tools, and  will  address  the  specific  tradeoffs
      created  by  conflicting  design  requirements.  After the tutorial, the
      attendee should have a good understanding of the principles  and  design
      tradeoffs involved in the construction of knowledge-acquisition tools, a
      solid background on existing tools, and a clear grasp  of  the  research
      issues that affect knowledge acquisition.
