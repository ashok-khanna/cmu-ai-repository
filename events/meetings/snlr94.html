   INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SHARABLE NATURAL LANGUAGE RESOURCES (SNLR)

			    10--11 August 1994
			  (just after COLING-94)
		 Nara Institute of Science and Technology
			    Ikoma, Nara, Japan

Real world text  processing is getting  greater  concern  of  computational
linguists than ever  before since large  scale real world texts are getting
more and  more available  in a machine  readable form.  On  one hand it  is
true, but on the other hand, lots of machine readable  texts are not freely
available to wide  range  of researchers.  Furthermore,  to  undertake real
world text  processing, we need to  have not only data   to be analysed but
also tools and data to analyse the texts.

We use the term  ``natural language resources''  to refer to all the  tools
and the data that are necessary or useful  for natural language processing.
Various natural language  resources are  repeatedly built and  abandoned in
many researchers and  research  groups,  resulting in a  great loss to  our
community as a whole.

Natural   language resources are classified   into  at least the  following
types:

1. Natural Language Tools:
   o Part of speech taggers
   o Morphological analysers
   o Syntactic or semantic parsers
   o Information retrieval tools

2. Natural Language Data:
   o Dictionaries (monolingual, multi-lingual)
   o Thesauruses
   o Grammars
   o Corpora (monolingual, multi-lingual)
   o Semantic representation languages for NL
   o Knowledge representation languages for NL
   o Knowledge bases for NLP

This workshop  aims  to bring  together researchers    and  developers  who
contribute toward providing natural  language  resources that can be shared
among   researchers.  Authors are   invited  to  submit papers  with  clear
specification, characteristics,  aim and coverage   of any natural language
resources that are SHARABLE.  The presentation  are  to be accompanied by a
demonstration.  Papers without  demonstration will receive less priority of
acceptance.

NOTE: This workshop is not intended for commercial products.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Authors are invited to submit 4 copies of an extended abstract  (4 pages or
less on A4 or letter size papers).  The submitted papers should  include at

current status  of sharable  natural language  resources and  wish  to
contribute to the promottion of such activities.

One and  half day   of  the workshop   will  be devoted   to technical
presentations  and poster sessions, both of  which will be accompanied
by a demonstration.   The  last half day  will be  used  for separated
demonstration for each presented work.
