                       CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

            8th International Parallel Processing Symposium


                         April 26-29, 1994
                            Hotel Regina
                           Cancun, Mexico

                 Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society
              Technical Committee on Parallel Processing
                  In cooperation with ACM SIGArch


The 8th International Parallel Processing Symposium is sponsored by the
Technical Committee on Parallel Processing which was established by the
IEEE Computer Society to advance knowledge in all areas of parallel
processing and related technologies.  The Symposium is the committee's
primary forum for engineers and scientists from around the world to
present their latest research findings in the field.  In addition to
technical sessions of submitted paper presentations, IPPS '94 will offer
workshops, tutorials, a parallel systems fair, and commercial exhibits.

WORKSHOPS: To be held on the first day of the Symposium, workshops are an
opportunity to explore special topics.  Individuals and/or special
interest groups are encouraged to submit proposals which cover a
particular topic in the field.  Send a one page proposal to the Symposium
Chair by September 30, 1993.

TUTORIALS: Proposals are solicited for organizing full or half-day
tutorials to be held on the first day of the Symposium.  Interested
individuals should submit a proposal by October 25, 1993 to the Tutorials
Chair.  It should include a brief description of the intended audience, a
lecture outline and vita for lecturer(s).

PARALLEL SYSTEMS FAIR: This all day event will include presentations by
researchers who have parallel machines under development.  A presentation
summary should be submitted to the Parallel Systems Chair by October 25,
1993.  Proposers will be notified of acceptance/rejection decision by
December 31, 1993.  Camera ready papers are due January 31, 1994.
Proceedings will be available at the Symposium.  A selected set of papers
will be considered for publication in a dedicated issue of the IEEE
Parallel and Distributed Technology publication.

COMMERCIAL EXHIBITS:  Companies are encouraged to exhibit at IPPS '94.  If
the Cancun location prevents a fully mounted exhibit, alternative
presentations are welcome.  For details or to make sure your company is on
the IPPS mailing list, contact the Symposium Chair by October 25, 1993.

Don't Miss IPPS '94 In Cancun, Mexico!

The Yucatan peninsula with a shoreline of over 1600 kilometers is one of
Mexico's most exotic areas.  Over a thousand years ago the peninsula was
the center of the great Mayan civilization.  Cancun with it's powder fine
sand and turquoise water is a scenic haven for sun lovers and
archaeological buffs alike, and our Mexican hosts are eager to extend
every hospitality for our visit to their part of the world.

Air travel to Cancun is available from most major U.S. cities, and U.S.
and Canadian citizens do not require passports to visit Mexico.  The Hotel
Regina is a self-contained meeting facility with spacious, air-conditioned
rooms, on-site restaurants, and all the services of a world class hotel.
Cancun is a dazzling resort with golf, tennis, and every water sport under
the sun, and the area offers exciting nightlife, fabulous shopping, and
historic Mayan ruins.

Join us in Cancun where once again researchers, system developers, and
users from around the world will convene to present leading developments
in parallel processing and related applications.  As in the last 2 years,
the first day of the symposium will feature workshops and tutorials.  In
addition to technical sessions, the remaining 3 days will include the
previously well-received parallel systems fair as well as commercial
participation.
