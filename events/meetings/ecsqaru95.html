CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------
for the third European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to 
Reasoning and Uncertainty ECSQARU'95

Conference Location: ECSQARU'95 will be held at the University of Fribourg, 
Switzerland. The charming medieval town of Fribourg, located on the border 
between the French and German speaking parts of Switzerland hosts the only 
bilingual university of Europe teaching both in French and German. Meet in 
this multicultural environment to discuss interdisciplinary approaches to 
reasoning and uncertainty.


Aims and Scope
--------------
ECSQARU'95 will be the third European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative 
Approaches to Reasoning and Uncertainty. Like its two predecessors, ECSQARU'95
is sponsored and organized by the DRUMS consortium. DRUMS, Defeasible Reasoning
and Uncertainty Management Systems, is a European Esprit III Basic Research 
Action uniting over twenty European universities and research organizations with
the goal of developing and synthesizing approaches to reasoning and uncertainty 
emerging from disciplines such as logic, probability and fuzzy systems.

Like its predecessors, ECSQARU'95 is open to the international community of 
researchers interested in reasoning and uncertainty. Contributions are invited 
treating all aspects of reasoning, symbolic or quantitative, nonmonotonic and 
other non-standard logics, probability and statistics, evidence or 
Dempster-Shafer theory, etc. Theoretical and algorithmic contributions 
focussing on unifying and integrating different approaches are especially 
encouraged, as are presentations of architectures for reasoning under 
uncertainty and reports on applications.

Organized by
DRUMS2: Defeasible Reasoning and Uncertainty Management Systems, Esprit III 
        BRA 6156
ESAPRA: European Society for Automated Practical Reasoning and Argumentation

Supported by:
the University of Fribourg
