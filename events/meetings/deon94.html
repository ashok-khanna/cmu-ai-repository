INFORMATION REGARDING ACCOMMODATION AND REGISTRATION

The Soria Moria Centre is a modern, residential conference centre, situated
on the north-west side of Oslo, overlooking the city. Single and double
rooms (both with bathroom) are available. The prices given below include
room for four nights (arrival: Wednesday 05 Jan.; departure Sunday 09
Jan.), dinner on the Wednesday evening (at 19.30 hrs.), breakfast, lunch
and dinner on each of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and breakfast on the
Sunday morning. Accompanying persons pay the same rate.
Single room              NOK 3980

Those attending the Workshop will be charged a registration fee to cover: a
copy of the book containing conference proceedings, expenses of invited
speakers, coffee breaks (two per day on each of the three days), and
overheads (in particular, the hire of the conference room). The organisers
have done their best to keep the fee as low as possible; should it happen
