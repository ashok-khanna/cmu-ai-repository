			    CALL FOR PAPERS
   IEEE Computer Society 1994 International Conference on Computer Languages

		 Toulouse, France, May 16-19, 1994

Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Languages
In cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN and IRIT


This is the fifth in a series of conferences devoted to all aspects of computer
languages, serving to bring together people broadly interested in machine
processable descriptions.  The hallmarks of ICCL are diversity, openness to a
wide range of linguistic research, and international representation.
The focus is on new ideas in languages and language technology which are
innovative or experimental in design, implementation, specification or
application.  The conference normally includes a number of panel discussions
on particular linguistic issues as well as a formal tutorial on a topic
of general interest to the computing community.


Papers are sought that describe significant new theoretical results or
approaches, novel language features and designs, clever implementation
techniques, notable application experiences, or insightful evaluations.


Areas of particular interest include but are not limited to:

Implementation/optimization           Object-oriented languages
Theory/semantics                      Multiparadigm languages
Abstract interpretation               Real-time/fault-tolerant languages
Dataflow analysis                     Requirements/design/specification
Partial evaluation                      languages
Parallel/distributed languages        Visual/graphical languages
Functional/logic languages            Application-specific languages


Papers should be at most 20 double-spaced pages (10 pt on 16 pt) in length,
should have an abstract of approximately 250 words, and a separate
cover page indicating the title, authors, and a list of keywords. Papers
will be judged on the basis of their relevance, significance, originality,
correctness, and clarity.  Accepted papers will appear in a full proceedings
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, for which authors will be
expected to sign a copyright release form.  A selection of best papers
will be published in a journal.


Also sought are proposals for panel sessions on linguistic topics of general
interest to the computing community.  Panel session proposals must include
a title, organizer's name, approximately 250 word overview, and a list of
panelists that have agreed to participate if the proposed panel session
is accepted.


Submit 5 copies of papers or 3 copies of panel session proposals by
September 24, 1993 to the program committee chair:

	Dr. Henri Bal
	Vrije Universiteit
	Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science
	De Boelelaan 1081a
	1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands

	+31 20 5485574, bal@cs.vu.nl
	Fax: +31 20 6427705


Submissions should be accompanied by a cover letter that
includes a return mailing address, telephone number and email address.

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by December 8, 1993.
Camera ready versions of accepted papers will be due January 12, 1994.
