                                   DX-94
        The Fifth International Workshop on Principles of Diagnosis
	                     New Paltz, NY, USA
                             October 12th-14th
                                     
                              Call for Papers

This is an annual workshop to encourage interaction and cooperation among
researchers in artificial intelligence with diverse approaches to diagnosis.
Previous workshops in this series were held in Aberystwyth (UK) in 1993,
Washington State (USA) in 1992, Milan (Italy) in 1991, at Stanford University
(USA) in 1990, and in Paris (France) in 1989. 

Attendance is by invitation, with three days of presentations and substantial
time reserved for discussion. 

Those interested in presenting should submit papers for review by the
committee.  Submissions are welcome on (but not limited to) the following
topics: 

   o Theory of diagnosis: abductive, deductive, or probabilistic
     theories. 

   o Inductive approaches to diagnosis: learning from examples, case-based 
     reasoning, neural nets.

   o Computational issues: controlling combinatorial explosion;
     focusing strategies; controlling inference in complex systems; use,
     inference, or absence of structural knowledge.

   o Modelling for diagnosis: multiple, approximate, incomplete,
     probabilistic, and qualitative models; integration of heuristics with
     model-based diagnosis; principles of modelling; dynamic systems; 
     modelling complex systems. Acquiring models and diagnostic knowledge.

   o The diagnosis process: Strategies for Repair, Sensor Placement,
     Test Selection, Resource-bound diagnosis.

   o Understanding the principles behind practical applications. 
     Evaluation of the practical benefits of theoretical results.

   o The relationship between diagnosis and other areas, particularly 
     Logic Programming, Machine Learning, Control Theory,  and
     Software V&V/debugging/synthesis.

   o Principled Applications: real-world applications are encouraged,
     from a wide range of fields, such as control theory, medicine,
     chemical engineering, electrical engineering, etc.  Papers should
     make some contribution towards the principles of diagnostic reasoning.
     Of interest are the diagnostic techniques used, in particular the
     relationship between formal models of diagnosis and the techniques
     needed in practice.

Although not a requirement, previously unpublished work is preferred.  Papers
are limited to a maximum of 5000 words; shorter papers are encouraged, but
space should be used to ensure adequate presentation.  Include postal (and
courier) addresses, electronic mail, fax, and telephone numbers.  Please
indicate whether you wish to present or only attend.  The conference chair
(below) must receive three paper copies of each submission by May 23rd, 1994,
and notifications will be sent by July 25th.  Accepted papers can be revised
for inclusion in the workshop working notes.
