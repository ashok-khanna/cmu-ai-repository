   AN INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE AND PRESENT A PAPER ON

   VIRTUAL REALITY IN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

   AT THE ROYAL SOCIETY LONDON

   INTERNATIONAL MEETING

   19 - 20 July 1995


   A two day event for the scientific, engineering and medical
   communities with active and interactive presentations,
   demonstrations and hands, eyes and ears in new worlds doing
   new things.  An experience designed for both the expert and
   those entering this rapidly growing and important field.
   All keynote speakers, presenters, and exhibitors are leaders
   in the field and of known international repute.

   The very latest developments and applications in VR and
   telepresence for: aerospace,  military systems, robotics,
   education, medicine, information engineering, basic physical
   sciences, entertainment, nano-worlds, training and complex
   systems will be presented, discussed and experienced.
   Whilst the event is focused on applications and future
   developments, the raw technologies and human facing
   implications of VR will also be considered.

   Presenters are encouraged to introduce interactive and live
   demonstrations involving members of the audience. Large screen
   2D and 3D projection facilities will be available with supporting
   sound systems and ISDN plus satellite telecommunications
   facilities.  For overseas visitors, computing engines may be
   made available by prior agreement with supporting
   organisations and exhibitors at the event. The organising
   committee are open to all suggestions and proposals,
   especially if they involve a degree of novelty that will
   promote the understanding and appreciation of the topic, and
   invoke audience reaction and participation.

   It is anticipated that this prestige non-commercial event
   will attract a high level of press and media attention with
   an audience of leading academic and practitioners, plus
   influential technology and scientific opinion formers. The
   proceedings of the event will be published in both paper and
   CD ROM formats complete with demonstration programs as
   available.

   In the first instance your intention and availability to
   participate, along with the proposed title of your paper
   should be communicated to Steven Whalley, by fax, letter or
   preferably by e-mail as follows:
