VENUE

The CAAP/ESOP/CC conferences will be hosted by the University of Edinburgh 
in April 1994. Organised by the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer 
Science, the conferences will be held in the James Clerk Maxwell Building 
at King's Buildings, the University's science campus, approximately 2 miles 
south of Edinburgh city centre. Accommodation is available through us at 
nearby student residences. 

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, and one of the world's most enchanting 
cities, is located in the East of Scotland on the Firth of Forth, about 400 
miles north of London. It is well served by transport: hourly flights from 
London, and direct connections to many European cities; nearby Glasgow 
airport has connections from many US cities. Edinburgh offers numerous 
places of interest including Edinburgh Castle, one of Scotland's main 
attractions, beautiful old town houses, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, art 
galleries, museums, and the Royal Botanic Gardens. Most of these places are 
within walking distance of the city centre or are easily accessible with 
local buses. Weather in Scotland is in general unpredictable. Temperatures 
in spring can vary between 8C and 20C, and there is usually a light breeze. 
You are best advised to bring several layers of clothing which can be put 
on and taken off as required, and don't forget your umbrella! 

REGISTRATION 

The registration fee covers lunches, coffee breaks, conference dinner and 
proceedings which are to be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture 
Notes in Computer Science series. Student fees do not cover the conference 
dinner or the proceedings, but dinner tickets and extra copies of the 
proceedings will be available for purchase at the conference. 

The conferences take place in the James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's 
Buildings, University of Edinburgh. The registration desk is open the 
evening before each conference and at intervals during the conferences 
themselves. 

ACCOMMODATION

We have arranged accommodation at a nearby university campus. Rooms are 
reserved for CC participants from 6th to 8th April 1994 and for CAAP/ESOP 
participants from 10th to 12th April 1994. It is possible to book rooms for 
the few days before and after these dates, and for the intervening day. 

Please note that the accommodation is basic student accommodation in single 
rooms. The accommodation was chosen because of its price and its convenient 
location near the conference site. Unfortunately we are unable to arrange 
alternative accommodation. If you do not want the accommodation we have 
reserved, you can make your own arrangements with Edinburgh hotels and bed 
& breakfast establishments. A list of such alternative accommodation is 
available by anonymous Internet ftp in the file 

	/pub/dts/accommodation  on  ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk

A printout of this file is available from the address below.

SATELLITE MEETINGS

First International Workshop on Action Semantics
Thursday 14 April 1994

Actions speak louder than words: Action Semantics is now being used in 
practical applications! This workshop will survey recent achievements, 
demonstrate tools, and coordinate projects. It is open to all. If you wish 
to attend, please contact Peter D. Mosses (pdmosses@daimi.aau.dk) by 28
February 1994. 

It is still possible to organise additional satellite meetings; contact 
George Cleland at the address below.

DEMONSTRATIONS

A number of academic and commercial systems will be demonstrated during
the course of the conference. There is still space available and it may be
possible to arrange for equipment for the demonstrations. Contact George
Cleland at the address below. Note that a fee will be charged for commercial
exhibitors.

PUBLISHERS' EXHIBITIONS

There will be an exhibition by publishers during the conference. Contact 
the address below for information about exhibiting.
