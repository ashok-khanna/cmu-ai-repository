                        ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
                                     Joint
                          Automatic Target Recognizer
                      Systems and Technology Conference IV
                                      and
                          Image Understanding Workshop
                        November 14-17, 1994 Monterey, CA

The Fourth Automatic Target Recognizer (ATR) Systems and Technology Conference
will be held concurrently with the Image Understanding (IU) Workshop at the
Naval Postgraduate School and Hyatt Regency Hotel in Monterey, Cal., November
14-17, 1994. Since target/object recognition is a key objective of both groups,
for military as well as commercial applications, this joint conference has a
theme of "Cooperative Development".

The Joint Conference will minimize overlap between the ATR and IU sessions to
facilitate participation in both conferences. Civilian and Military leaders will
give key speeches about operational applications and emerging technologies of
interest to both groups. Some ATR sessions will be SECRET NOFORN.

CALL FOR PAPERS. The ATR Systems and Technology  Conference Committee is
soliciting original unclassified and classified (through SECRET NOFORN) papers
in the following areas. (Papers to be published in the 1994 IU proceedings will
be solicited separately.)

* Target Recognition and Identification      * ATR Systems
* Target Detection and Tracking              * Multisensor Database Management
* Moving, Time-critical, and Hidden Targets  * Evaluation Methodologies
* Data Synthesis and Characterization        * Man-Machine Interfaces
* Phenomenology-based Algorithms             * Multisensor Processing

Submit an unclassified abstract that concisely describes your paper (300 words
or less); also include the classification level of the paper, lead author,
co-authors, industry and/or government organization, mailing address, e-mail
address, phone and FAX numbers. By submitting an abstract to this conference,
you are committing your paper exclusively to this conference, should it be
accepted.

Abstracts postmarked no later than March 15, 1994, should be sent to Annette
Bergman at this address: Commander, Code C2158 Attn: A. Bergman,
NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6001. The
lead author will be notified of acceptance or regret by May 20, 1994.

Camera-ready manuscripts of accepted papers must be postmarked not later than
August 20, 1994 and sent to Mr. Andrew Zembower, IIT Research Institute, 4140
Linden Ave., Suite 201, Dayton, OH 45432.
