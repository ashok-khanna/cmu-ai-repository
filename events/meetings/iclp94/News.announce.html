                       Call For Papers

          INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGIC PROGRAMMING (ICLP'94)

	        S. Margherita Ligure, Italy, 13-18 June 1994

	   Sponsored by the Association of Logic Programming


Logic programming originates from the discovery that a subset of
predicate logic could be given a procedural interpretation which was
first embodied in the programming language Prolog. The unique features
of logic programming make it appealing for numerous applications in
artificial intelligence, computer-aided design and verification,
databases, and operations research as well as to explore parallel and
concurrent computing. The last two decades have witnessed substantial
developments in this field from its foundation to implementation,
applications, and the exploration of new language designs.

ICLP'94 is the eleventh international conference on logic programming
and is one of the two major annual international conferences reporting
recent research results in logic programming. The technical program
for the conference will include tutorials, invited lectures, and
presentations of refereed papers and posters. Papers are welcome on
all aspects of logic programming, including, but not limited to:

	Applications			 Language design
	Architecture			 Natural language
	Artificial Intelligence 	 Parallelism
	Concurrency     		 Programming methodology
	Constraints			 Proof theory
	Databases			 Semantics and foundations
	Environments			 Static analysis
	Higher-order programming	 Theorem Proving
	Implementation         		 Types


Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15 pages (including
references and figures), and must contain a cover page including the
following: a 200 word abstract, keywords, and postal and electronic
mailing addresses as well as phone numbers and fax numbers of the
responsible author. Submitted papers should not have been previously
published or being submitted to any journals or refereed conferences.
Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.

Send SIX (6) copies of your submission by NOVEMBER 15, 1993 to

	Pascal Van Hentenryck
	Brown University, Box 1910
	Providence, RI 02912 (USA)
	Email: pvh@cs.brown.edu
	Phone: +1 401 863 76 34
	Fax: +1 401 863 76 57

Authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their
papers by FEBRUARY 21, 1994. Final versions of the accepted
papers must be received in camera-ready form by MARCH 15, 1994.
The proceedings will be published by MIT Press.

ICLP'94 will take place in Santa Margherita Ligure, a small town in
the Italian Riviera close to Genova, the largest city of Liguria.
Close to the conference site is the worldwide famous village of
Portofino, pearl of the Mediterranean Sea and marine natural park; not
far from Santa Margherita is also the pleasant resort area of "Cinque
Terre", consisting of five pictoresque villages on the rocky coast
which can be reached by train or boat only.

		FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

	"Logic and Reasoning with Neural Networks"

		Workshop at the
International Conference on Logic Programming ICLP'94
	Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy
		June 17 or 18, 1994


Description of the Workshop
===========================
The goal of the workshop is to initiate discussions
and foster interaction between researchers interested
in the use of neural networks and connectionist models
for various aspects of logic and reasoning.

There are a number of domains where the combination
of neural networks and logic opens up interesting
perspectives:


* Methods for Reasoning

- cognitively plausible models of reasoning
- reasoning with vague knowledge
- neural inference mechanisms
- probabilistic reasoning with neural networks

* Knowledge Representation Aspects

- representation of non-symbolic information
- knowledge acquisition from raw data (rule extraction)
    with neural networks
- representation of vague knowledge
- similarity-based access to knowledge
- context-dependent retrieval of facts

* Integration of Symbolic and Neural Components

- combining sub-symbolic and symbolic information
- pattern recognition
- sensor fusion

* Implementation Techniques

- connectionist implementations of symbolic inference mechanisms
- neural networks as massively parallel implementation technique
- neural networks for learning of search heuristics


There are at least three major aspects where a discussion
of neural networks / connectionist models can be beneficial
to the logic programming community at this time:

* development of reasoning techniques which are
  closer to the way humans reason in everyday situation

* dealing with vague knowledge, i.e. imprecise, uncertain,
  incomplete, inconsistent information, possibly from
  different sources and in various formats

* efficiency improvements for symbolic inference mechanisms,
  e.g. through adaptive learning from previously solved problems,
  or content-oriented access to rules and facts


Submission of Papers
====================

Prospective contributors are invited to submit papers
or extended abstracts to the organizers by April 1, 1994.
They will be notified about acceptance or rejection by May 1.
The final version of the papers is due June 1.

We are planning to make the full papers accessible
to the workshop participants in an ftp archive,
and hand out only copies of the abstracts.
If possible, please use a text processing program
that allows you to produce PostScript output;
otherwise it might be difficult to print out
copies on other systems than the one you used.


Preliminary Agenda
==================

There will be one or two talks of approximately 30 min.
where the essential background on the use of neural networks
for logic and reasoning will be presented.
The main purpose for this is to offer a brief introduction to
those attendants with little knowledge of neural networks,
and to provide a common framework of reference for the workshop.
Care will be taken that these presentations concentrate on
fundamental aspects, providing an overview of the field
rather than a detailed technical review of one
particular system or approach.

The rest of the time slots will be used for presentations
of submitted papers, i.e. approximately two in each section,
with enough time for discussion.
The final time schedule will be distributed after May 1.
The workshop will be concluded by a final discussion
and a wrap-up of important aspects.



Important Dates
===============

Submission deadline     April 1, 1994
Notification of acceptance/rejection    May 1, 1994
Final version of papers due     June 1, 1994
Date of the workshop    June 17 or 18, 1994


Registration
============
According to the standard policy of LP post-coference workshops,
the workshops are integrating part of the conference.
This means that participants of the workshop are expected
to register for the conference.

                               Call For Papers

                       ICLP'94 Postconference Workshop on
                   Process-based Parallel Logic Programming

                           June 17 or 18, 1994
                       S. Margherita Ligure, Italy


In the last decade, several process-based parallel logic programming languages
(Delta-Prolog, CS-Prolog, MB-Prolog, Multi-BinProlog, Shared Prolog, $\mu$Log)
have been proposed as an alternative for committed choice languages and
and/or-parallel execution models. Their main features are, on the one hand,
the explicit process creation as opposed to the and/or evaluation of goals and
clauses, and, on the other hand, the explicit communication based on channels
or blackboards instead of that achieved by shared variables.  Other
characteristics include the properties that the parallelism is
programmer-controlled, processes are loosely coupled, multi-paradigm
applications can easily be built, and last but not least, existing sequential
code can be incorporated in this new concurrent framework.  As suggested, the
languages (also called coordination languages) offer a quite pragmatic approach
to concurrency in logic programming. It is believed to be well-suited for
development purposes, and for the integration of multiple paradigms, possibly
including constraint handling.

The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in all
aspects of process-based logic programming, including but not limited to the
following topics:

* Language design (both concurrent and sequential)
* Theory and foundations
* Implementations and architectures
* Compilation techniques
* Programming methodologies and Applications.

Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to send, by e-mail or
by regular mail, a 3-5 page abstract or, preferably, a full paper before April
15th.  The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and based on
this review, they will be included in informal proceedings to be distributed to
the attendees. A selection of these papers will be presented at the workshop.
Acceptance/rejection will be notified by May 15th.

		POST-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP

		PROOF-THEORETICAL EXTENSIONS OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING

This workshop is intended to provide a forum for researchers to exchange
ideas on the influence of proof theory on the future development of the
field of logic programming.  This follows the workshops named

were held in Tuebingen, Germany, (1989), Stockholm, Sweden, (1991),
Bologna, Italy, (1992), St Andrews, Scotland, (1993). The
proceedings of each has been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence series (numbers 475, 596, 660, forthcoming). The
workshop intends to bring together researchers from the two fields and
evaluate the state of the art. Given the different backgrounds required,
it may include a tutorial part besides contributed papers.

We expect papers exploring (or criticizing) the fruitfulness of the
proof-theoretic approach to traditional and novel issues in logic
programming. Topics include, but are not necessarily limited to

     o proof-theoretic foundations
       - cut elimination
       - negation-as-failure
       - equational theories
       - program completion
       - reasoning by induction
       - partial inductive definitions
       - linear logic
       - constructive, modal and temporal logics
       - many-valued logics
       - higher-order logics
       - type-theoretic approaches

     o languages
       - Elf
       - GCLA
       - Isabelle
       - lambda Prolog
       - LO!
       - Lolli
       - ACL

    o applications
       - program synthesis, transformations and equivalence
       - program termination
       - unification theory and constraints
       - theorem proving
       - programming language implementations
       - modularity
       - knowledge representation

                       ICLP'94 Postconference Workshop on
                   Process-based Parallel Logic Programming

                           June 17 or 18, 1994
                       S. Margherita Ligure, Italy


In the last decade, several process-based parallel logic programming languages
(Delta-Prolog, CS-Prolog, MB-Prolog, Multi-BinProlog, Shared Prolog, $\mu$Log)
have been proposed as an alternative for committed choice languages and
and/or-parallel execution models. Their main features are, on the one hand,
the explicit process creation as opposed to the and/or evaluation of goals and
clauses, and, on the other hand, the explicit communication based on channels
or blackboards instead of that achieved by shared variables.  Other
characteristics include the properties that the parallelism is
programmer-controlled, processes are loosely coupled, multi-paradigm
applications can easily be built, and last but not least, existing sequential
code can be incorporated in this new concurrent framework.  As suggested, the
languages (also called coordination languages) offer a quite pragmatic
approach to concurrency in logic programming. It is believed to be well-suited
for development purposes, and for the integration of multiple paradigms,
possibly including constraint handling.

The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in all
aspects of process-based logic programming, including but not limited to the
following topics:

* Language design (both concurrent and sequential)
* Theory and foundations
* Implementations and architectures
* Compilation techniques
* Programming methodologies and Applications.

Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to send, by e-mail or
by regular mail, a 3-5 page abstract or, preferably, a full paper before April
15th.  The submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and based
on this review, they will be included in informal proceedings to be
distributed to the attendees. A selection of these papers will be presented at
the workshop.  Acceptance/rejection will be notified by May 15th.

People interested in attending the workshop are welcome too. They are kindly
requested to send their postal and (if available) electronic address as soon
as possible.
