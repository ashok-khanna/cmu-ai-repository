High-quality submissions are sought for the European Symposium on Programming
(ESOP'94) which will take place in Edinburgh, in conjunction with CAAP'94 and
CC'94.  See below for the call for papers for all three conferences.  Note the
submission deadline:       **** 15th OCTOBER ****

Facilities will be provided for holding short specialized workshops and
other meetings in conjunction with CAAP/ESOP/CC'94.  Organizers of such
meetings should make contact soon with the chairman of the local arrangements

   COLLOQUIUM on TREES in ALGEBRA and PROGRAMMING

   This colloquium series was originally devoted to the algebraic and
combinatorial properties of trees, and their role in various fields of
Computer Science.  The importance of trees in Computer Science is now
firmly established, and the study of their algebraic, logical, and
combinatorial properties has made significant progress.  Many other
structures such as graphs are playing similar roles and deserve similar
theoretical studies.  In keeping with CAAP's traditions while accounting
for these new trends, CAAP '94 will focus on algebraic, logical, and
combinatorial properties of discrete structures such as strings, trees,
graphs, combinatorial configurations on grids, and tilings, just to list
the main notions.  A central topic is the theory of formal languages
considered in this broad sense, i.e. the study of automata, grammars,
systems of equations, logic, rewriting systems, etc. as descriptive
formalisms.  The topics include also applications to Computer Science
provided that algebraic or syntactic methods are involved.

   This conference is devoted to fundamental issues in the specification,
design and implementation of programming languages and systems.  The
emphasis is on research that bridges the gap between theory and practice,
for example an implemented system that embodies an important concept or
method, or a formal framework for design that usefully addresses issues
arising in practical system development.  The scope of the conference
includes work on: software analysis, specification, transformation,
development and verification/certification; programming paradigms
(functional, logic, object-oriented, concurrent, etc.) and their
combinations; programming language concepts, implementation techniques and
semantics; software design methodologies; typing disciplines and
typechecking algorithms; and programming support tools (this is not an
exhaustive list).

   The International Conference on Compiler Construction provides a forum
for presentation and discussion of recent developments in the area of
compiler construction, language implementation and language design.  Its
scope ranges from compilation methods and tools to implementation
techniques for specific requirements of languages and target architectures.
It also includes language design and programming environments issues which
are related to language translation.  There is an emphasis on practical and
efficient techniques. Topics include, but are not restricted to: tools for
any phase of compilation; methods and techniques for code generation and
optimization; compilation for parallel architectures; programming
environments; translation of computer languages (imperative, functional,
logic, object-oriented, parallel, etc.); translation of application and
specification languages; other tools closely related to compiler
construction, e.g.  debuggers, data flow analyzers, etc.
