                      Call  For  Papers:
                  Postconference  Workshop
        Non-monotonic  Extensions  of  Logic  Programming:
           Theory,  Implementation,  and  Applications
    (in conjunction with ICLP '94, S. Margherita Ligure, Italy)
                       June 13 -18, 1994

During the last couple of years a significant body of knowledge has been
accumulated providing us with a better understanding of semantic issues in
logic programming and the theory of deductive databases. In particular, the
class of perfect models for (locally) stratified logic programs and two
closely related extensions to normal, non-disjunctive, logic programs were
introduced and extensively investigated: the well-founded models and the
stable models. The problem of extending these approaches and defining a
suitable semantics for the class of disjunctive logic programs and deductive
databases turned out to be a difficult one, as evidenced by a large number
of papers and the recent book of Lobo, Minker and Rajasekar devoted to this
issue.
    Logic programs rely on a non-monotonic operator, often referred to as
negation by failure or negation by default.  The non-monotonicity of this
operator allows us to view logic programs as special non-monotonic theories
and thus makes it possible to draw from the extensive research in the area
of non-monotonic reasoning and use it as a guidance in the search for a
suitable semantics for logic programs.
    Research work aimed at better understanding of the relationships exist-
ing between logic programming (LP) and nonmonotonic formalisms (N- MF) is
mutually beneficial to both areas.  NMFs help us to determine suitable
semantics for LP and help us understand how LPs can express and compute
solutions to AI problems. Conversely, the NMFs can utilize the wide body of
knowledge already gathered about LPs and apply the existing implementations
of LPs.
    This one-day workshop is the fourth in a series of workshops held in
conjunction with Logic Programming conferences (NACLP '90, ILPS '91, and
ILPS '93) and will be concerned with all of the three aspects of Theory,
Implementation, and Applications.  Papers are welcome on all non- monotonic
aspects of logic programming, including, but not limited to:

        Abductive Extensions                  Implementations
        Applications to KR                    Inconsistency Handling
        Constructive Negation                 New Application Domains
        Disjunctive LP                        Semantics
        Epistemic Extensions                  Strong or Explicit Negation

{\bf W1: Process-based Parallel Logic Programming}\\
Several process-based parallel logic programming languages
(e.g., Delta-Prolog, CS-Prolog, Multi-Prolog and Shared-Prolog)
have been proposed as an alternative to goal-based (and/or)
parallel execution models for logic programs.
The main features of these languages are explicit process
creation and explicit communication based on channels or
blackboards.
The workshop is aimed at being a forum for discussing the
various topics of process-based parallel LP,
ranging from theory to practice.

{\bf W6: Parallel and Data-Parallel Execution of Declarative Languages}\\
The workshop will focus on language constructs, implementation technology,
program analysis and practical experiences of declarative programming languages
on parallel computers.
There will be an emphasis on data parallel computation (not restricted to
SIMD computation) and other massively parallel computation models.
It is expected that logic programming languages will be more represented
than, e.g., functional programming languages but we would consider
participation
from these neighbouring fields valuable.

\noindent
{\bf W7: Applications of Logic Programming to Software Engineering}\\
We will discuss which features
of logic programming are most useful for a software engineer, and
which software engineering applications have been already developed
based on a logic programming approach. Suggested topics are:
Requirement analysis, specification and design based on logic programming,
software engineering environments including rule-based components,
Prolog-based tools,
software process modeling based on logic languages, and
 Logic and Object-oriented programming methods.

\noindent
{\bf W8: Integration of Declarative Paradigms}\\
The interest on the integration of declarative paradigms and, in particular,
the integration of functional and logic programming, has been spurred anew,
especially for what concerns efficient implementation. The aim of this
workshop is to bring together researchers from different communities as well
as to give the logic programming community an idea of recent advances in the
area. A non-exhaustive list of topics is: language features, semantics,
execution principles, implementation issues, abstract interpretation of
integrated languages, environments for integrated languages.

of deductive DB systems, and techniques from deductive DBs can be used for
the processing of large logic programs.
Topics of the workshop are: disjunctive DBs; sets, types and aggregation;
abstract interpretations and program transformations; non-deterministic
extensions of logic DB languages; non-monotonic deduction; constraint
reasoning in DBs; subsumption; expressiveness of query languages; query
optimization and evaluation; logics of active DBs; updates and knowledge
acquisition.

{\bf W11: Logic programming and education}\\
The workshop will focus onto two different aspects of the research
concerned with the
use of logic programming, in particular of Prolog, in education. From one
hand we
consider issues and problems related to the teaching (and learning) of
Prolog: problems
in understanding Prolog, misconceptions of novices, ways of representing
the behaviour of Prolog, problems of supporting program construction and
debugging, etc.
On the other hand we consider the opportunities offered by Prolog as a tool
for the
implementation of classroom products, such as modelling tools, tutoring
systems,
problem solvers etc.
