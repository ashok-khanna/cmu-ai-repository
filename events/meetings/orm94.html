                    International Conference on Object-Role Modelling

                         1994 July 4 - 6, Townsville, Australia


Object-Role Modelling (ORM) is a conceptual modelling approach used for
database design which depicts information structures in terms of objects and
the roles that they play. Various versions of the approach exist, including
BRM, FORM, NIAM, NORM, PSM and MOON. All these versions make use of the
"circle-box" notation introduced in NIAM, which facilitates the expression of
a wide variety of constraints and enables fact types to be populated with
instances for validation purposes. The approach is being increasingly used in
industry, and several research programs are refining and extending the
modelling techniques involved. This international conference on Object-Role
Modelling provides an opportunity to bring together leading researchers and
practitioners in the area to clarify and extend the state-of-the-art of this
modelling approach. While the focus of the conference is on ORM, papers on
related conceptual modelling approaches are also welcome.

The conference program will include paper presentations, workshops and panel
discussions. Papers may be submitted on technical issues, practical
applications and educational issues. The venue for the conference is
conveniently situated near major tourist attractions, such as the Great
Barrier Reef, and tropical rain-forests. Although winter time in Australia,
the location on the north Queensland coast ensures pleasant temperatures in
the twenties (Celsius). The refereed conference proceedings will be available
as an academic publication.

Topics to be considered for presentation include (but are not restricted to):
Fundamental concepts of ORM                   Distributed databases and ORM
The process of modelling                      Modelling incomplete information
Metamodelling issues                          CASE for ORM
Object-oriented and other extensions          Schema integration and evolution
Algorithms for mapping (between levels)       Schema transformations
Modelling of processes, events                Schema abstraction
Formalization of ORM                          Re-engineering
Reusability
Teaching of ORM (secondary, tertiary, industry)
Practical aspects of using ORM in industry
ORM compared with other approaches
The place of ORM in the development cycle
Related conceptual modelling methods

Authors should submit FOUR (4) copies of an original paper, not exceeding 7000
words or the equivalent of 10 pages in 10 point font (single line spacing), to
one of the program committee co-chairs.

A one day excursion to the outer Great Barrier Reef, and a three-day "winter
school" are planned to follow the ORM conference. The winter school will
include tutorial presentations by leading international speakers on topics
such as: conceptual modelling; transaction management; and artificial
intelligence.

This school is to be located on Magnetic Island (20 minute boat ride from
Townsville). For further details on this school, please contact Prof. Gupta
(organizing chair).
