J. Eliot B. Moss, Program Chair for OOPSLA'94, asked me to remind potential
OOPSLA'94 authors that the deadline for submitting papers really is the
15th of February -- there is no hidden later deadline...  An abstract of
how to submit papers is:

  Authors should send six copies of the full paper, in English, to the
  program chair (address below), to be received no later than 15 FEBRUARY
  1994. Papers must not exceed 18 PAGES, double-spaced, exclusive of figures
  and bibliographic references.  Electronic submissions will not be accepted.
  Each copy must contain CONTACT INFORMATION (contact name, postal address,
  telephone number, fax number, and electronic mail address), a 100 word
  ABSTRACT, indication of the CATEGORY (research or experience), and TOPIC
  AREA(S) as follows: language design and implementation, tools and
  environments, components and frameworks, user interfaces, principles and
  theory, databases and persistence, reflection and meta-level architectures,
  concurrent and distributed systems, design methods and software engineering
  practices. If none of the topic areas seem to apply, please contact the
  Program Chair for advice, preferably by electronic mail. The submission
  deadline is rigid; late submissions will NOT be processed.

E-mail address:  listserv@csr.uvic.ca

In the BODY of the message (not in the subject line), include keyword
such as:
    help
or:
    index oopsla-94
or:
    get oopsla-94 call.for.participation.text

Our list server is very fragile, so please treat it kindly.  Specifically,
please do not include ANY extra text in the body of your message (no
pleasantries, no signatures, etc.) -- just the keywords.  Also, the
keywords must be in the *body* of the message not the subject line.  Please
note that due to internet mail delays, the file may take a day or so to
reach you.

Example (using the very simple Unix mail program):
	% mail listserv@csr.uvic.ca      <-- you type the command
	Subject:                         <-- you type return for "no subject"
	help                             <-- you type "help"
	^D                               <-- you send the message
Another example:
	% mail listserv@csr.uvic.ca      <-- you type the command
	Subject:                         <-- you type return for "no subject"
	get oopsla-94 call.for.participation.text <-- you type
	^D                               <-- you send the message

This Hotline is automatic - your e-mail has been processed by auto-answer
program.  No human has read your message.  If you are having trouble with
the Hotline, or need to communicate with an OOPSLA'94 representative about
some issue that the Hotline does not provide an answer for, you can contact

(for OOPSLA'94 Administration).

    	    	    	>>> PLEASE <<<

Thank you.  (Also, the Hotline is automatic and thus available 24 hours a
