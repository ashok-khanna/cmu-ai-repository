AIICSR'94


The    AIICSR'94   Conference    (Artificial   Intelligence   and
Information-Control  Systems  of  Robots)  is  already  the sixth
conference  dealing with  integration of  knowledge from  various
spheres   of  artificial   intelligence,  computer   science  and
robotics. At  present, the complexity  of the problems  concerned
requires an  integrated approach and not  an isolated research in
the  science branches  given above.  Robotics with  its adaptive,
mobile  and intelligent  robots represents  a real  result of the
efforts  within  artificial  intelligence,  expert  and knowledge
systems,  as well  as within  vision systems,  sensorics, control
theory  and  in  the  architecture  of  computer systems allowing
real-time applications.

The aim of the Conference  is to make the participants acquainted
with  contemporary state-of-the-art  and with  recent results  in
artificial intelligence,  intelligent information-control systems
of robots and computer architecture  for AI. Moreover, the aim of
the  Conference  is  to  contribute  to  continuous and efficient
transfer  of new  knowledge and  methods produced  by science and
research in artificial intelligence  and related disciplines into
design  of  intelligent  production  technology.  The  scientific
program of AIICSR'94 consists of 11 invited papers, presenting an
overview of major recent research  areas, of 8 position papers of
the  members of  the International  Program Committee  and of  27
submitted papers.
