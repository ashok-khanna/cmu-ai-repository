This conference presents novel techniques for robustly integrating and inter-
preting data from multiple sources. The applications emphasis is automated
and robotic systems; such systems often include multiple-and-moving cameras, 
range and proximity detctors, force and touch feedback, etc. A typical system
requirement is to use the sensors, plus prior knowledge, to efficiently locate,
identify, and track objects; more advanced applications may require a detailed
inspection and mapping of the environment, including global determination of 
robot position and state of task completion. Technical challenges include 
multi-sensor registration and calibration, combining sensor information over 
space-and-time, 3-D shape modeling and shape recovery, 3-D object recognition 
and localization et al. One important problem is how to intelligently plan and 
control sensors to achieve a task-specific sensing objective, in the practical 
implementation context of maximized information with minimized computation. 
For example, "active vision" addresses how to purposively direct camera gaze,
vergence, and focus, analagous to human viewing. "Exploratory sensing" expands 
this paradigm to cooperative fusion of vision, range, touch, and other sensory 
modes, and may include the use of multiple distributed robot agents, e.g. to 
develop environmental maps, and perform cooperative work.  Implementing such 
active, exploratory sensing has foundations in both machine and biological 
behavior, and both perspectives are welcome. Another problem of fundamental 
importance is effective techniques for distributed detection & decision, e.g., 
as applies to asynchronous data fusion in spatially dispersed sensor arrays; 
automated production scheduling and system health monitoring; command-control-
communication within distributed information networks such as automated highway
systems; human-machine shared control of telerobotic systems, et al.

In summary, we invite papers on multi-sensory fusion and its applications. 
Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:

o	modeling and calibration of multiple sensors
o	3-D object modeling-and-recognition from multiple sensor views
o	recovery of scene structure from time-sequence sensor data
o	fusion of passive-active sources: vision-range, IR-microwave, etc.
o 	remote sensing, automated inspection, and target recognition 
o	robotic sensor fusion: visual, range, force, tactile, & kinematic data
o	task-driven robotic sensing and strategic planning of sensor activity
o	high-level robot task planning & control based on multi-sensor inputs 
o	multiple robot agents and cooperative sensing strategies
o	distributed detection & decision networks and their applications
o	human-machine shared control of automation and robotic systems
o	novel sensor fusion architectures and programming environments
