          Second Brisbane Neural Network Workshop
          ---------------------------------------

            Queensland University of Technology
                Brisbane Q 4001, AUSTRALIA
               Gardens Point Campus, ITE 410
                     24 September 1993

This Second Brisbane Neural Network Workshop is intended  to
bring together those interested in neurocomputing and neural
network applications.  The objective of the workshop  is  to
provide   a   discussion   platform   for   researchers  and
practitioners interested in theoretical and applied  aspects
of  neurocomputing.  The  workshop  should be of interest to
computer scientists and engineers, as well as to biologists,
cognitive   scientists   and   others   interested   in  the
application of neural networks.

The Second Brisbane Neural Network Workshop will be held  at
Queensland  University  of  Technology, Gardens Point Campus
(ITE 410) on September 24, 1993 from 9:00am to 6:00pm.
