	     Eigth International Workshop on Unification
			Preliminary announcement
		      and call for participation

		Thursday, June 23 - Saturday, June 25, 1994
			VAL D'AJOL FRANCE


This workshop is the eigth in a series of three-days meetings on
unification and related topics, the previous ones having been in Val
d'Ajol (France), Lambrecht (Germany), Leeds (UK), and Barbizon
(France), Dagstuhl(Germany) and Boston (USA).
As its predecessors, UNIF'94 is meant to be an opportunity to meet
old and new colleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work,
and to discuss new ideas and trends in unification and related fields.
It is also a good opportunity for young researches and researchers
working in related areas to get an overview of the current state of
the art in unification theory.

This year's workshop will be organized  by Denis Lugiez.  We intend to
have sessions  with short   talks  (15 to  30  minutes), followed   by
discussions,    panel    discussions on  actual    topics, and  system
demonstrations.

The following is a (non-exclusive) list of possible topics:

	* Narrowing				* Typed Unification
	* General E-unification and Calculi	* Foundations
	* Implementations			* Applications
	* Special Unification algorithms	* Combination problems
	* Constraint solving			* Disunification
        * Higher-Order Unification              * Type reconstruction

Val  d'Ajol is a  small village in  France, located in  the south west
part of the Vosges, close to Remiremont and not far from Nancy. It can
be reached by car or train. The workshop will take place in hotel
de la Residence  and the   cost will  be  about  1300FF  (including
accomodations, meals  and registration fees).   Because of the  size of
the facilities, places at the workshop will be  limited  to about 45 -
50 persons,  which means  that we cannot   guarantee  participation to
everybody.  The final list  of participants will be  selected  by  the
organizing committee.

If you intend to participate in the workshop, please apply as soon as
possible (preferably by E-mail before end of February) to
