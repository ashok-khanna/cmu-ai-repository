                            CALL FOR PAPERS

              Revised due date: Tuesday, February 15, 1994

As Cognitive Science has matured over the years, it has broadened its
scope in order to address fundamental issues of cognition embedded
within culturally, socially, and technologically rich environments.  The
Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society aims at
broad coverage of the many topics, methodologies, and disciplines that
comprise Cognitive Science.  The conference will highlight new ideas,
theories, methods and results in a wide range of research areas relating
to cognition.

The conference will feature plenary addresses by invited speakers,
technical paper and poster sessions, research symposia and panels, and a
banquet.  The conference will be held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, home
of the Civil Rights movement, the 1996 Olympics, and the Dogwood
Festival.


GUIDELINES FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Novel research papers are invited on any topic related to cognition.
Reports of research that cuts across traditional disciplinary boundaries
and investigations of cognition within cultural, social and
technological contexts are encouraged.  To create a high-quality program
representing the newest ideas and results in the field, submitted papers
will be evaluated through peer review with respect to several criteria,
including originality, quality, and significance of research, relevance
to a broad audience of cognitive science researchers, and clarity of
presentation.  Accepted papers will be presented at the conference as
talks or posters, as appropriate.  Papers may present results from
completed research as well as report on current research with an
emphasis on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives.

Authors should submit five (5) copies of the paper in hard copy form by
Tuesday, February 15, 1994, to:

   only.  Accepted papers will be presented either as talks or posters,
   depending on authors' preferences and reviewers' recommendations
   about which would be more suitable, and will not reflect the
   quality of the papers.

6. A note stating if the paper is eligible to compete for a Marr Prize.


DEADLINE

Papers must be received by Tuesday, February 15, 1994.  Papers received
after this date will be recycled.

The Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society

August 13-16, 1994
Atlanta, Georgia


Registration Information

The Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society will be held
August 13-16, 1994, at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Georgia Tech is
located in the heart of Atlanta, and is within walking distance of two of the
stations on the city's rapid rail transit system.  The Conference itself will
be held in Georgia Tech's Student Center Complex, with plenary talks held in
Georgia Tech's new 1200-seat Theater for the Arts, which was recently the
site of the 1992 Vice-Presidential Debate.  The Student Center contains
automated teller machines, a post office, a travel agency, a convenience
store, the campus bookstore, dining facilities, and recreational facilities
including bowling, billiards, and video games.

The city of Atlanta, which has been listed in the Places Rated Almanac as one
of the most livable cities in the nation, is the capital of Georgia and is
home to more than two million residents.  Atlanta is the business, financial,
and transportation center of the Southeast.  At 1,050 feet above sea level,
the city enjoys a pleasant climate permitting year-round outdoor activities.
A moderate cost of living and one of the best public transportation systems
in North America contribute to Atlanta's appeal.  Atlanta also offers an
impressive variety of entertainment ranging from sporting events to symphony
and theatrical performances, as well as the exciting nightlife of Underground
Atlanta and Buckhead.  Atlanta offers experimental theater, diverse musical
events, a thriving film industry, and a respected art museum.  For those
interested in spectator sports, Atlanta is home to the Hawks, the Falcons,
and the two-time National League champion Atlanta Braves.  For these and
other reasons, Atlanta has been host to many events of international
interest, including the 1988 Democratic National Convention and the 1994
Super Bowl.  In the Summer of 1996, Atlanta will host the world at the
Centennial Olympic Games.

Education in Cognitive Science

In conjunction with the Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science
Society, we will be hosting an all-day workshop on Education in Cognitive
Science on Wednesday, August 17.  While articulating objectives for different
kinds of programs (e.g. degree or certificate) and institutions, we will
evaluate the design and effectiveness of existing programs.  In addition,
focus will be placed on how what we have discovered about learning in
cognitive science research can be used in the service of cognitive science
education.  If you would like more information about this workshop, please
mark the appropriate box on the Conference Registration Form and watch for an
announcement calling for position papers on the Internet.


Gala Banquet

On Sunday evening, August 14, we'll be holding our annual gala banquet at the
historic Georgia Railroad Depot at Underground Atlanta.  The fare will be
traditional Southern dining, with all the trimmings.  We have also arranged
to extend the operating hours of the World of Coca-Cola, also at Underground
Atlanta.  The World of Coca-Cola is an interactive museum featuring Atlanta's
most famous corporate resident, and is one of Atlanta's most popular tourist
attractions.  Admission to the World of Coca-Cola is included in the price of
the banquet, which is $35.00.  After the banquet, attendees may want to enjoy
the social atmosphere of Underground Atlanta's many nightclubs.


On-Campus Housing

We have reserved 250 single and double occupancy rooms in Georgia Tech's
newest residence hall for the Conference.  These rooms are all within easy
walking distance of the Conference facilities.  The rates are $19 per person
per night for a double occupancy room, including linen service, and $38 per
night for a single occupancy room.

To request an on-campus room, select "on-campus housing" on the Housing
Request Form and send it with prepayment for the required number of nights
for receipt by July 1 to the address indicated on the form.


Off-Campus Housing

We have also reserved a number of rooms in the nearby Marriott Courtyard
Hotel.  The daily room rate is $65 plus sales and room tax.  The Courtyard
provides free parking, and will also provide a free shuttle service to carry
their guests to and from the Conference.  There are also a limited number of
suites available at the Penta Hotel for $82 per day plus sales and room tax.

To reserve a room at the Marriott Courtyard or at one of Atlanta's other fine
hotels, contact Nancy Hallberg with Connections at 1-800-262-9974 or select
"off-campus housing" on the Housing Request Form.  Since there may be other
hotels available at the time of your booking, we recommend that you call
Connections directly.

Because there are several large events occuring in Atlanta at the same time
as the Conference, it is important to make your housing reservations as soon
as possible.  Availablility of 170 off-campus rooms is guaranteed through
July 1.  After July 1, Connections will do their best to find accommodations
for you.


Food

The Georgia Tech Student Center includes two dining facilities.  One is a
large cafeteria which serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The other is a
smaller venue which serves both hot and cold entrees, but is open only for
lunch.  Elsewhere on campus is Junior's, a Tech tradition in dining.  In
addition, Tech is within walking distance of several small restaurants
serving college student staples such as sandwiches and pizza.  For example,
just down the street is the Varsity, the world's largest fast food restaurant
and an Atlanta landmark (the chili dogs are legendary).  A slightly longer
walk, or a short drive, will get you to many of Atlanta's great restaurants
including a large variety of ethnic and European cuisines.


Parking

On-campus parking is available for $4.00 per day and will be paid as you
enter the parking area the first time each day.  If you expect to be parking
on campus, please indicate this on your registration form so we can arrange
for you to pay only $4.00 per day and not the standard $4.00 each time you
enter the parking facility.  Do not send us any money for parking.


Travel

Delta Airlines is the official airline of the Sixteenth Annual Conference of
the Cognitive Science Society.  Delta's primary hub is Atlanta's Hartsfield
International Airport, which is also served by most other major airlines.
Delta Airlines is offering special rates for all domestic travel connected
with the conference between August 10-19, 1994.  To reserve airline tickets
with Delta, call 1-800-241-6760 any day between the hours of 8am-11pm EDT and
refer to file number XX3140, Cognitive Science Conference 1994.  The two
discounts available are a 5% discount off any Delta domestic published fare
(D5405) and a 10% discount off Delta's domestic one-way or regular fare
(D5410).

As for travel within the Atlanta area, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority (MARTA) operates buses as well as an electric-powered rapid rail
system which connects many parts of the city and outlying regions.
Conference participants will be able to take the rapid rail system directly
from the baggage claim area at Hartsfield International Airport to the North
Avenue or Midtown MARTA stations, both of which are within walking distance
of the Georgia Tech campus.  The cost of this trip is $1.25, one way.  The
trains leave the airport approximately every ten minutes, every day, between
6:00am and 1:00am.  MARTA also makes available a five-day travel pass which
you can purchase in advance through us.  Simply check the appropriate box on
your registration form, include prepayment of $9, and return by July 1.

Taxi service is also readily available between Hartsfield International
Airport and Georgia Tech.  Currently, the fare is approximately $25.00, one
way.  Conference attendees who arrive when the MARTA rail service is not
available should definitely plan on using the taxi service, or they should
reserve a rental car.  All major rental car agencies operate at Hartsfield
International Airport.  Georgia Tech is about fifteen miles north of the
airport by car, and is easily reached by traveling a well-marked interstate
highway.
