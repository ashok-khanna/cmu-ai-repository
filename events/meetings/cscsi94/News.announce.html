                 The 10th Biennial Conference of the
              Canadian Society for Computational Studies
                        of Intelligence
                            (CSCSI)


                     Banff Alberta, May 16-20, 1994

AI-94 is the tenth biennial conference on Artificial Intelligence
sponsored  by the Canadian Society for the Computational Study of
Intelligence. It will be held  in  conjunction  with  the  Vision
Interface  and  Graphics  Interface  conferences.   Tony Marsland
(tony@cs.ualberta.ca), University  of  Alberta,  is  the  general
chair.

Contributions are  invited  that  present  original,  unpublished
results  in  all areas of Artificial Intelligence. They should be
sent to the program chair, Renee Elio,  Department  of  Computing
Science,   University   of   Alberta,   Edmonton,   Alberta
(ai94@cs.ualberta.ca).Papers must be received by November 15,1993.

Submitted papers must not exceed 5000 words in length,  including
abstract  and bibliography.  Theoretical and position papers will
be judged on their originality and contribution to the  field  of
AI,  and  applied papers on the importance and originality of the
application.  To help in the review process, authors should list,
in  decreasing  order  of  relevance,  1  to  3  of the following
keywords:

applications         learning          reasoning(indicate subarea)
cognitive modelling  search            knowledge representation
planning             architectures     knowledge acquisition
perception           robotics          language understanding
problem solving      theorem proving   neural nets/connectionism

Authors should submit four (4) complete copies of  the  paper  in
hardcopy  form,  for  review by members of the program committee.
Acceptance depends on the overall merit and significance  of  the
reported  research,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  the  written
presentation.  Each copy of the paper must include a cover  page,
separate  from  the  body of the paper, which includes, in order,
(1) title of the paper, (2) full names, postal  addresses,  phone
numbers,  and  email addresses of all authors, (3) an abstract of
no more than 250 words, and (4) keywords to  classify  the  paper
for  review purposes. As a condition of acceptance, the author or
a co-author must present the paper  at  the  conference.  If  the
paper is being submitted to other conferences, either in verbatim
or in essence, authors must clearly indicate this  on  the  cover
page.

Notification of acceptance or rejection will  be  mailed  to  the
first  author by February 7, 1994. Camera- ready copy of accepted
papers is due March 24, 1994. Each paper will be allotted  up  to
eight  (8)  double  column  pages  in the conference proceedings,
formatted using  12pt  LaTeX  or  equivalent.   Authors  will  be
provided  with  appropriate  LaTeX macros. The journal Artificial
Intelligence  also intends to publish the  "best  paper"  of  the
conference,  and  to provide a prize. Selection of the best paper
will be done by the program committee.


All correspondence concerning the conference should be directed
to ai94@cs.ualberta.ca.
