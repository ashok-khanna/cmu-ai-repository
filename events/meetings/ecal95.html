                          First Announcement

              3rd. EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL LIFE

                              ECAL95

                  Granada, Spain, 4-6 June, 1995


It is  a pleasure  to  announce the  forthcoming  3rd European  Conference  on
Artificial Life (ECAL95).

Despite its short life, Artificial Life (AL) is already a mature scientific
field. In trying to discover the rules of life and extract its essence so that
it can be implemented in  different media, AL research has led us to a
better understanding of a large set of interesting biology-related problems,
such  as self organization,  emergence, origins  of life,  self-reproduction,
computer viruses,  learning,  growth  and  development,  animal  behavior,
ecosystems, autonomous agents, adaptive robotics, etc.

The Conference  will be  organized into  Scientific Sessions,  Demonstrations,
Videos and Comercial  Exhibits. Scientific Sessions  will consist of  Lectures
(invited), Oral Presentations, and Posters.

The site of ECAL95 will be the city of Granada, located in the south of Spain,
in the region  of Andalucia. Granada  was the  last moors site  in the  Iberic
Peninsula, and it  has the  inheritance of their  culture with  the legacy  of
marvelous constructions such as the Alhambra and the Gardens of Generalife.

ECAL95 will be organized in  collaboration with the International Workshop  on
Artificial Neural Networks  (IWANN95) to  be held  at Malaga  (Costa del  Sol,
Spain), June  7-9, 1995.  These places  are  only one hour  apart by  car.
Special inscription fees will be offered to those attending both meetings.

Hi, NetFolks:
	I have set up ECAL'95 (3rd European Conference on Artificial Life) home
page at http://kal-el.ugr.es. For the time being, it features the announcement
and call for papers, as well as links to relevant places, including turistic
info about Granada, Artificial Life, and so on.

	This page will include all events relevant to the conference, until 
June 1995, when it will be held.

	Enjoy it..
