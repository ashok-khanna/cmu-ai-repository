TWLT

This is the sixth Twente Workshop on Language Technology organised
in Twente,  a beautiful region in the Netherlands.  Previous work-
shops have been on  Tomita's  Algorithm,  Linguistic  Engineering,
Connectionist  Natural Language Processing, Pragmatics in Language
Technology and Natural Language Interfaces.  In this international
workshop researchers  on  parsing  technologies  in  computational
linguistics  and  those  working  at  the  borderline of  computer
science and computational linguistics will get  the opportunity to
present  their research and discuss developments in  parsing tech-
nology.


About TWLT6

Topics of TWLT6 include:  parsing for  spelling correction,  head-
corner parsing and unification, the logical structure of language,
practical comparisons  between  parallel parsing algorithms,  tree
adjoining  grammar  parsing,   Definite  Clause  Grammar  parsing,
multiple  agents processing,  comparison of ALE and PATR,  parsing
ill-formed  input,  syntactic  and semantic information from punc-
tuation,  et  cetera.  The  proceedings  of the  workshop  will be
available during the workshop.

TWLT7 (first announcement) 


On 16-17 June 1994, the seventh international Twente Workshop on Language 
Technology (TWLT7) will take place at the University of Twente, Enschede, 
The Netherlands.
This time the workshop will be devoted to "Computer Assisted Language 
Learning"  (CALL). There will be several demonstrations. Proceedings will 
be available at the workshop.

The workshop will be organized around the following themes:

- CALL as application for NLP modules
- CALL and speech generation
- adaptive interfaces for CALL applications
- AI techniques in CALL
- evaluation of CALL
- integration of CALL in a language learning curriculum
- instruction technology in CALL
- multimedia aspects in CALL

TWLT7 is organized in cooperation with the PARLEVINK-project of the University
of Twente by:

Preliminary Announcement


Twente Workshop on Language Technology 8 (TWLT 8):
Speech and Language Engineering

Workshop organized under the auspices of the Dutch NWO 
Priority Programme on Language and Speech Technology, the
Special Interest Group on Parsing Technologies (SIGPARSE)
of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) and
the Centre of Telematics and Information Technology
(CTIT) of the University of Twente.


Dates: December 1 and 2, 1994

Location: University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands

Scientific Organizers:	L. Boves (University of Nijmegen)
			A. Nijholt (University of Twente)

Local Organizers:	R. op den Akker
			C. Bijron
			G. van der Hoeven
			A. Hoogvliet-Haverkate


General Information
The eight TWLT, to be held on December 1 and 2, 1994, will 
be devoted to speech, the integration of speech and natural
language processing and the application of this integration
in natural language interfaces. Well-known researchers from 
industry and university will be invited to present the state
of the art in speech and natural language processing. Part
of the program will consist of the presentation of research 
programmes on parsing in the framework of the recently 
started Dutch NWO programme on Speech and Natural Language.

Among the invited speakers are:

Paolo Baggia (CSELT, Italy)
Hervé Bourlard (Lernout & Hauspie, Belgium)
David Carter (SRI International, United Kingdom)
Louis Boves (University of Nijmegen)
Peter Wittenburg (Max Planck Instituut, Nijmegen) 
James McQueen (Max Planck Instituut, Nijmegen)
Herman J.M. Steeneken (TNO/Soesterberg)
Gertjan van Noort (University of Groningen)
Hermann Helbig (Fernuniversitaet Hagen)
Rens Bod (University of Amsterdam)
Paul van Alphen (PTT Research, Leidschendam)

Some other speakers will be invited. Their contributions or
poster presentations will be in the areas of robust parsing
into intermediate semantic representations, prosody, language
generation for dialogs, probabilistic parsing and neural 
networks and parsing. In addition to the program of invited 
speakers other researchers are invited to contribute to the 
workshop. Please send a title and an abstract of a possible
talk and paper to anijholt@cs.utwente.nl before September 15, 
1994. Poster presentations are welcome.

Invited and accepted papers will become part of the proceedings
that will be available during the workshop. Authors of papers
will receive an ‘Instruction for Authors’ in September of this
year. The final announcement including a program will be avail-
able in October 1994.

During the workshop pc's and workstations will be available for
demonstrations. 'Wizard of Oz' software, a neural network
language acceptor, a natural language interface to a database
system and an environment for grammar and parser development
based on the PATR formalism will be among the demonstrations.
