         Twelfth International Conference on Automated Deduction
                            Nancy, France

           Tutorials & Workshops: June 27
                      Conference: June 28-July 1, 1994

                         C A D E - 1 2
                      CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

The CADE conferences are the major forum for the presentation of new
research in all aspects of automated deduction.  In conjunction with
CADE-12 we hope to run several workshops.  The workshops will be held,
in parallel, on Monday 27th June and the main conference will be held
from Tuesday 28th to Friday 1st July.  Proposals for workshops are
hereby solicited.
     CADE conferences cover all aspects of automated deduction:

   First vs. Higher Order Logics             Classical vs. Non-Classical Logics
   Special vs. General Purpose Inference     Interactive vs. Automatic Systems

     Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

   Resolution             Sequent Calculus           Decision Procedures
   Unification            Rewrite Rules              Mathematical Induction

     and any applications of automated deduction, including:

   Deductive Databases                 Logic and Functional Programming
   Commonsense Reasoning               Software and Hardware Development

     The CADE-12 workshops will be held at INRIA Lorraine and CRIN
Campus Scientifique on Monday 27th June 1994.  Following this the
CADE-12 conference will be held at the Palais des Congr`es de Nancy,
sponsored by CADE Inc. and hosted by INRIA and CRIN.  Following
CADE-12, the LICS-94 conference will be held in Paris, France from
July 4-7, 1994.  A sight-seeing trip to Dijon will link the two
conferences.
     Anyone wishing to organise a workshop in conjunction with CADE-12
should write to the Programme Chair by 1st December 1993 describing
the topic of the proposed workshop; explaining why this topic is
relevant to CADE; naming the organisers and specifying the workshop's

[ LaTeX version included below ]

Theory reasoning offers  the  possibility  of  combining  general
problem  solving  methods with specialized problem dependent rea-
soning systems.  A distinguished feature of theory reasoning sys-
tems is that the interface for the interaction of the two reason-
ing parts has to be designed very carefully.

Examples of such calculi are theory resolution, theory model  el-
imination,  and  constraint  resolution, where the combination of
the two reasoners is done on the literal or formula level. Anoth-
er  approach  offers  unification  based methods by integrating a
specialized theory reasoner at the term level.

Theory reasoning can also be seen as a framework for the integra-
tion  of  different reasoning paradigms.  The topic is of growing
interest and is an example of semantics-based  reasoning  as  op-
posed  to  purely syntactic reasoning.  Theory reasoning offers a
bridge from powerful knowledge representation  systems  to  effi-
cient theorem proving.


Topics of interest: 
--------------------
This workshop is intended to be quite broad; it should bring  to-
gether  interested researchers to exchange ideas, clarify notions
and point out new challenging research problems.  Papers are wel-
come  on all aspects of theory reasoning, including, but not lim-
ited to:

  o Applications of theory reasoning   o Implementation issues
  o Computational aspects              o Interface issues
  o Constraints                        o System descriptions
  o Hybrid systems                     o Theory reasoning calculi


Workshop: 
----------
The workshop is held in conjunction with CADE-12 (Twelth Interna-
tional  Conference on Automated Deduction).  Attendence is by in-
vitation only; authors of accepted papers will be  invited.   In-
formal  proceedings  containing  the accepted papers will be sup-
plied by the CADE organizing committee.  The registration will be
by  standard  CADE registration forms.  Further information about
CADE-12 can be obtained by anonymous ftp from  dream.dai.ed.ac.uk
(192.41.104.168), directory /pub/cade-12.


Submission:

Mathematical induction is required for reasoning about objects or
events containing repetition, e.g. computer programs with recursion or
iteration, electronic circuits with feedback loops or parameterised
components. It is thus a vital ingredient in the development of formal
methods for the synthesis, verification and transformation of computer
software and hardware. There are also applications of mathematical
induction in the formation of plans containing repetition and in
explanation based learning of repetitive actions. Thus the automation
of inductive reasoning provides a major opportunity for the
application of AI techniques to design problems in computer science.

This workshop is the third in a series organised by the MInd and IndUS
consortia on the automation of proofs by mathematical induction. Previous
workshops were held in Albany (NY) in conjunction with CADE-11, and in
Washington (DC) in conjunction with AAAI-93. MInd is a European
consortium funded by ESPRIT and IndUS is a United States consortium
funded by NSF. The workshop is open to both members and non-members of
the MInd and IndUS consortia.

Topics of interest:
--------------------

The aim of the workshop is to bring together all researchers
interested in automating inductive reasoning. Topics for discussion
may include, but are not limited to, the following:

    o formalisms for inductive inference
    o explicit induction and inductive completion
    o architectures for inductive inference
    o heuristics for controlling inductive proof search
    o mechanisms for choosing induction rules
    o mechanisms for generalisation
    o mechanisms for suggesting lemmas
    o the productive use of failure
    o applications of inductive inference
    o the relationship between recursive programs and inductive
      proofs.

You are invited to suggest other topics and possible speakers.


Format of workshop:
-------------------

The workshop will consist of panel discussions and research
presentations. Each panel discussion will address a "hot topic" in
inductive proof and will last approximately two hours. Two speakers, who
have made rival and significant contributions to these topics, will
each give a short introduction. The discussion will then be
thrown open to the floor. A combination of technical and
polemical contributions will be encouraged. So as to take
advantage of the most recent developments, we will leave the final
selection of "hot topics" until just before the workshop.
Selected participants will be invited to give short presentations of
their current research. Preference will be given to work that is
novel, promising and not already familiar to the other participants.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with CADE-12 (Twelth International
Conference on Automated Deduction). Attendence is by invitation only.
Registration will be via the standard CADE registration form.  Further
information about CADE-12 can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
dream.dai.ed.ac.uk (192.41.104.168), directory /pub/cade-12.


Submission:
------------
Persons wishing to attend the workshop should submit three copies of a
1 page summary of research in this area along with a postal address, phone
number and an electronic mail address (if possible). Applications should be
sent to Toby Walsh at the address below to arrive by Friday 15th April
1994. As postal services can be slow, we welcome electronic submissions,
preferably in LaTeX or plain text format. All electronic submissions will
be acknowledged on receipt (though submissions received before April 1st
will not be acknowledged till after April 1st). The research summaries will
be circulated to workshop participants.

[ LaTeX version included below ]

Theory reasoning offers  the  possibility  of  combining  general
problem  solving  methods with specialized problem dependent rea-
soning systems.  A distinguished feature of theory reasoning sys-
tems is that the interface for the interaction of the two reason-
ing parts has to be designed very carefully.

Examples of such calculi are theory resolution, theory model  el-
imination,  and  constraint  resolution, where the combination of
the two reasoners is done on the literal or formula level. Anoth-
er  approach  offers  unification  based methods by integrating a
specialized theory reasoner at the term level.

Theory reasoning can also be seen as a framework for the integra-
tion  of  different reasoning paradigms.  The topic is of growing
interest and is an example of semantics-based  reasoning  as  op-
posed  to  purely syntactic reasoning.  Theory reasoning offers a
bridge from powerful knowledge representation  systems  to  effi-
cient theorem proving.


Topics of interest:
--------------------
This workshop is intended to be quite broad; it should bring  to-
gether  interested researchers to exchange ideas, clarify notions
and point out new challenging research problems.  Papers are wel-
come  on all aspects of theory reasoning, including, but not lim-
ited to:

  o Applications of theory reasoning   o Implementation issues
  o Computational aspects              o Interface issues
  o Constraints                        o System descriptions
  o Hybrid systems                     o Theory reasoning calculi


Workshop:
----------
The workshop is held in conjunction with CADE-12 (Twelth Interna-
tional  Conference on Automated Deduction).  Attendence is by in-
vitation only; authors of accepted papers will be  invited.   In-
formal  proceedings  containing  the accepted papers will be sup-
plied by the CADE organizing committee.  The registration will be

             PROOF SEARCH IN TYPE-THEORETIC LANGUAGES


                 Nancy, France, June 26, 1994


This workshop will focus on the problems of proof search in
type-theoretic languages.  Such languages are used as logical
frameworks for representing proofs and, in some cases, formalize
connections between proofs and programs that support program
synthesis.  
The purpose of the workshop is to discuss recent results
in, and to establish and publicize a research agenda for, proof search
in type theories and their use in the formal development of correct
proofs and programs.

Topics: 
------

The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in  
all aspects of proof search in type-theoretic languages, including but 
not limited to the following topics: 

* foundations of proof search in type theory frameworks 

* techniques and concepts related to proof construction 
  and related analysis  

* proof synthesis vs program synthesis (applications, specific methods)

* environments for formal proof development in type-theoretic frameworks

Workshop:
--------

The workshop is held, during one full day (June 26, 1994),
in conjunction with CADE-12 Conference). Attendance is by invitation
only: authors of accepted submissions will be invited. Informal
proceedings will be supplied by the CADE organizing committee. 

Submission:
----------

Researchers interested in presenting their work are invited to send an
extended abstract (5-7 pages) to each of the organizers named below.
Researchers interested in attending the workshop (without giving a
presentation) should send a position paper (1-2 pages) presenting 
their interest. 
e-mail submissions (*.dvi or *.ps files) are requested 
(hardcopies are also accepted) before April 8, 1994. Notification of 
acceptance and invitations to the workshop will be issued by 
May 5, 1994. Material to be handed out at the workshop should be 
received in final form before May 24, 1994. 

All submissions and information requests should be sent to the

            PROOF SEARCH IN TYPE-THEORETIC LANGUAGES


                 Nancy, France, June 26, 1994


This workshop will focus on the problems of proof search in
type-theoretic languages.  Such languages are used as logical
frameworks for representing proofs and, in some cases, formalize
connections between proofs and programs that support program
synthesis.
The purpose of the workshop is to discuss recent results
in, and to establish and publicize a research agenda for, proof search
in type theories and their use in the formal development of correct
proofs and programs.

Topics:
------

The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in
all aspects of proof search in type-theoretic languages, including but
not limited to the following topics:

* foundations of proof search in type theory frameworks

* techniques and concepts related to proof construction
  and related analysis

* proof synthesis vs program synthesis (applications, specific methods)

* environments for formal proof development in type-theoretic frameworks

Workshop:
--------

The workshop is held, during one full day (June 26, 1994),
in conjunction with CADE-12 Conference). Attendance is by invitation
only: authors of accepted submissions will be invited. Informal
proceedings will be supplied by the CADE organizing committee.

Submission:
----------

Researchers interested in presenting their work are invited to send an
extended abstract (5-7 pages) to each of the organizers named below.
Researchers interested in attending the workshop (without giving a
presentation) should send a position paper (1-2 pages) presenting
their interest.
e-mail submissions (*.dvi or *.ps files) are requested
(hardcopies are also accepted) before April 8, 1994. Notification of
acceptance and invitations to the workshop will be issued by
May 5, 1994. Material to be handed out at the workshop should be
received in final form before May 24, 1994.

All submissions and information requests should be sent to the
workshop organizers:

[ LaTeX version included below ]

Theory reasoning offers  the  possibility  of  combining  general
problem  solving  methods with specialized problem dependent rea-
soning systems.  A distinguished feature of theory reasoning sys-
tems is that the interface for the interaction of the two reason-
ing parts has to be designed very carefully.

Examples of such calculi are theory resolution, theory model  el-
imination,  and  constraint  resolution, where the combination of
the two reasoners is done on the literal or formula level. Anoth-
er  approach  offers  unification  based methods by integrating a
specialized theory reasoner at the term level.

Theory reasoning can also be seen as a framework for the integra-
tion  of  different reasoning paradigms.  The topic is of growing
interest and is an example of semantics-based  reasoning  as  op-
posed  to  purely syntactic reasoning.  Theory reasoning offers a
bridge from powerful knowledge representation  systems  to  effi-
cient theorem proving.


Topics of interest: 
--------------------
This workshop is intended to be quite broad; it should bring  to-
gether  interested researchers to exchange ideas, clarify notions
and point out new challenging research problems.  Papers are wel-
come  on all aspects of theory reasoning, including, but not lim-
ited to:

  o Applications of theory reasoning   o Implementation issues
  o Computational aspects              o Interface issues
  o Constraints                        o System descriptions
  o Hybrid systems                     o Theory reasoning calculi


Workshop: 
----------
The workshop is held in conjunction with CADE-12 (Twelth Interna-
tional  Conference on Automated Deduction).  Attendence is by in-
vitation only; authors of accepted papers will be  invited.   In-
formal  proceedings  containing  the accepted papers will be sup-
plied by the CADE organizing committee.  The registration will be
by  standard  CADE registration forms.  Further information about
