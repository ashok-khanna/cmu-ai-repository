                            CALL  FOR   PAPERS


   International Symposium on Integrating Knowledge and Neural Heuristics
                              (ISIKNH'94)

Sponsored by University of Florida, and AAAI,
in cooperation with IEEE Neural Network Council,
and Florida AI Research Society.

Time: May 9-10 1994; Place: Pensacola Beach, Florida, USA.


A large amount of research has been directed
toward integrating neural and symbolic methods in recent years.
Especially, the integration of knowledge-based principles and
neural heuristics holds great promise
in solving complicated real-world problems.
This symposium will provide a forum for discussions
and exchanges of ideas in this area. The objective of this symposium
is to bring together researchers from a variety of fields
who are interested in applying neural network techniques
to augmenting existing knowledge or proceeding the other way around,
and especially, who have demonstrated that this combined approach
outperforms either approach alone.
We welcome views of this problem from
areas such as constraint-(knowledge-) based learning and
reasoning, connectionist symbol processing,
hybrid intelligent systems, fuzzy neural networks,
multi-strategic learning, and cognitive science.

Examples of specific research include but are not limited to:
1. How do we build a neural network based on {\em a priori}
knowledge (i.e., a knowledge-based neural network)?
2. How do neural heuristics improve the current model
for a particular problem (e.g., classification, planning,
signal processing, and control)?
3. How does knowledge in conjunction with neural heuristics
contribute to machine learning?
4. What is the emergent behavior of a hybrid system?
5. What are the fundamental issues behind the combined approach?

Program activities include keynote speeches, paper presentation,
and panel discussions.

Scholarships are offered to assist students in attending the

their resumes and a statement of how their researches are related
to the symposium.
