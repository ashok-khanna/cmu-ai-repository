Due to post delivery problems in Belgium, the organizers of ESANN'94 have
decided to accept submitted papers till beginning of December.
But to avoid lost papers, authors or prospective authors are strongly invited
to make them known by sending an E-mail to the address 'esann@dice.ucl.ac.be',
before November 30th, mentioning their name(s), the title and authors of the
paper, and an E-mail address or fax number where they can be reached if the
paper is not received.

ESANN'94 is the second symposium on fundamental aspects of artificial neural
networks.  Papers are still welcome in the following areas (this list is not
restrictive):
works :
. theory
. models and architectures
. mathematics
. learning algorithms
. biologically plausible artificial networks
. neurobiological systems
. adaptive behavior
. signal processing
. statistics
. vector quantization
. self-organization
. evolutive learning
Accepted papers will cover new results in one or several of these aspects or
will be of tutorial nature.  Papers insisting on the relations between
artificial neural networks and classical methods of information processing,
signal processing or statistics are encouraged.

People interested in ESANN'94 and having not received the call for papers are
invited to contact the conference secretariat for further information.
