	  Eight Austrian Artificial Intelligence Conference

			      FLAI'93
	      Fuzzy Logic in Artificial Intelligence

			 June 28-30, 1993
	Bildungszentrum St. Magdalena, Linz, Austria (Europe)


		 Announcement and Call for Papers

		      General Information
Recently, a rapidly growing number of real world applications based on
fuzzy logic has drawn much attention to the theory's scientific
background.  Especially the artificial intelligence research community
has focused interest in ways to integrate advantages of fuzzy logic
into existing techniques such as expert systems. This conference will
present recent advances in achieving this goal.

			     Program
The scientific program will include invited talks and presentation of
selected papers. The program will be complemented by panel discussion
and the possibility of organizing workshops (June 28, 1993) on
selected topics. Also on June 28, tutorials and demonstrations (partly
in German language) will be given. Persons planning a demonstration
should contact the chairpersons as soon as possible.

		     Topics of the Conference
Submissions are invited on issues covering all aspects of fuzzy logic
related to artificial intelligence, including but not strictly limited
to:

 * Fuzzy Inference
 * Relations to other Approximate Reasoning Methods
 * Engineering Applications
 * Uncertainty Management
 * Theoretical Foundations
 * Learning and Acquisition of Approximate Models
 * Critics (controversial statements are solicited and will be
	   impartially reviewed)
 * Applications of Fuzzy Logic to
   - Expert Systems
   - Knowledge Representation
   - Qualitative Modeling
   - Process Control
   - Databases
   - Neural Networks
   - Case Based Reasoning
   - Genetic Algorithms
   - Scheduling
   - Pattern Recognition

			Submission of Papers
Prospective participants are encouraged to submit papers dealing with
any of these issues. Research results, position declarations, and
system descriptions are all appropriate. A paper need not describe
final results, so reports on work in progress are welcome. Papers
should be not longer than 12 pages including title, figures, tables,
and references. Review copy submissions are to be sent via electronic
mail to flai93@vexpert.dbai.tuwien.ac.at (standard LaTeX or pure
ASCII only). If electronic submission is impossible, send five paper
copies (same deadline) clearly marked FLAI'93 to Wolfgang Slany
(address below). Prospective participants may contact committee
members for more information on the conference.

			   Important Dates
Deadline for submission of papers .................. January 22, 1993
Notification of acceptance ........................ February 26, 1993
Camera ready copy ..................................... April 2, 1993


	       Proposal for Workshops (June 28, 1993)
Particularly welcome are proposals for workshops that promote
collaboration between fuzzy logic and other research areas.  The
position of each group can be summarized in a paper that will appear
in the FLAI'93 Proceedings. The deadline for proposals is January 22,
1993.
