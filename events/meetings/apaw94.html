                              CALL FOR PAPERS

          THIRD ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSING AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP
                  Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York

               Wednesday August 10 to Friday August 12, 1994

                               Sponsored by

                   The Syracuse University CASE Center
                                    and
                 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology


The goal of this Workshop is to promote interaction among researchers
interested in the most recent technological advances relevant to
associative processing.  As in the previous two Workshops, we seek an
international gathering of researchers from academia and industry whose
work involves the design, analysis, development, and application of
associative processors and content addressable memories.  To encourage
authors to report on work in progress, the Workshop format is kept
informal.

Detailed abstracts of technical papers in all areas of associative
processing are invited.  Topics include, but are not limited to:

   * Architectures - Simulated or experimental results from chips to
      entire systems, trade-off studies
   * Physical design - CAM cell design, CAM chip design, silicon
      compilation
   * Interfaces - Von Neumann/associative, special controllers, etc.
   * Applications - Either implemented, or under development
   * Software models of associative processors - Functional, stochastic
      models
   * Algorithm analysis - Time complexity, hardware requirements
   * Programming paradigms - Software development environments, tools,
      languages, high level languages to associate memory compilers
   * Program mappings - Techniques for mapping problems and algorithms
      to associative machines and associative memories

Attendance will be limited to ensure time for interaction among the
workshop participants.

SUBMISSIONS:

Authors are invited to send six (6) copies of an extended abstract to be
received by June 7, 1994.  Abstracts are restricted to no more than 5
double-spaced pages (1500 words), not including bibliography or figures.
Abstracts must include a cover letter with the following information:
title of paper, full names of authors, postal and E-mail addresses of
the authors, phone and FAX numbers, and keywords indicative of the theme
of the paper.

Authors will be notified of acceptance by July 8, 1994.  Full papers or
updated abstracts can be submitted for inclusion in the proceedings no
later than July 25.  Proceedings will be distributed at the workshop.

All submissions and inquiries for further information should be
directed to:
