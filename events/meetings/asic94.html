                           ASIC'94
                    September 19 - 23, 1994
                      Rochester, New York

                     CALL FOR PAPERS, WORKSHOPS,
                         and TUTORIALS

The Seventh Annual IEEE International ASIC Conference and Exhibit
is organized to promote the practice of ASIC engineering by providing
ASIC and systems level engineers/scientists and managers with the
knowledge of the tools and techniques required in all phases of ASIC
design and implementation. It emphasizes the understanding of practical
details, trade-offs and economics of system integration using
programmable array, gate array, standard cell, cell compiler, and full
custom techniques in both the digital and analog domains.

The conference offers:
(1)     An in-depth introduction to ASIC implementation for the
        systems engineers;

(2)     An advanced program for the experienced ASIC engineers;

(3)     A forum for ASIC users and vendors to share case design
        experiences; and

(4)     Executive overviews of ASIC trends, strategy, economics
        and competitiveness.
