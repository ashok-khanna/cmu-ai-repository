                        Call for Papers

                          I C D T'95

          International Conference on Database Theory

          Prague, Czech Republic, January 11-13, 1995

ICDT'95 is an international conference on theoretical aspects of
databases. As ICDT'92 (Berlin), this conference follows two series of
conferences on database theory that were formed in parallel by
different scientific communities in Europe. The first series, known
as International Conference on Database Theory, was initiated in
Rome in 1986, and continued in Bruges (1988) and Paris (1990).
The second series, known as Symposium on Mathematical Fundamentals of
Database Systems, was initiated in Dresden (1987), and continued in
Visegrad (1989) and Rostock (1991). ICDT is held bi-annually.


Topics
------
We solicit papers describing original ideas and new results on
theoretical aspects of all forms of databases. Major themes to be
covered include, but are not limited to:

active database systems
complex objects
complexity and optimization
concurrency control and recovery
data models and design theory
data structures and algorithms for databases
database programming languages
datalog analysis
deductive databases
dependencies and constrains
distributed and heterogeneous databases
fundamentals of security and privacy
incomplete information
multimedia information systems
nonmonotonic reasoning
object-oriented databases
query evaluation and optimization
query languages
transaction management
updates

Papers & Authors are invited to submit 8 copies of a full conference
paper (which might be an extended abstract where proofs are only
sketched) of at most 5 000 words before June 13, 1994, to one of the
program co-chairs:
