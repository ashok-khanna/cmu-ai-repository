CONDITION OF ACCEPTANCE :

	Authors are expected to secure travel and accomodation funding,
independent of the organizers, through their sponsoring organizations
before submitting abstracts. Only original material should be submitted.
Abstracts should contain enough detail to clearly convey the approach and
the results of the research   ( a full paper may be joined, it will help
for paper acceptance by the scientific committee ).
	Government and company clearance to present and publish should be final at
the time of submittal. Submissions may be placed in an oral or poster
session at the chairs' discretion.

PROCEEDINGS OF THESE MEETINGS :

	These meetings will result inpublished proceedings that can be ordered

applicants and must be submitted in English by 30 august 1994. Copyright to
the manuscript is expected to be released for publication in the conference
proceedings. Note : if an author does not attend the meeting and make a
presentation, the chair may choose not to publish the author 's manuscript
in the conference proceedings. Papers published are indexed in leading
scientific databases including INSPEC, Compendex plus, Physics abstracts,
Chemical abstracts, International aerospace abstracts and index to
Scientific and technical proceedings.

PAPER REVIEW :

	Commercial papers, description of papers with no research content, and
papers where supporting data or a technical description cannot be given for
proprietary reasons will not be accepted for presentation in this
symposium. 
	To assure a high quality conference, all abstracts and proceedings papers
will be reviewed by the conference chairs and their scientific committees
for technical merit and content.

YOUR ABSTRACT SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING :


	1. ABSTRACT TITLE
	2. AUTHOR LISTING (principal author first) full names and affiliations 
   	as they will appear in the advance programme.
	3. CORRESPONDENCE FOR EACH AUTHOR
	   Mailing address, telephone, telefax, e-mail address
	4. SUBMIT TO :          
	   Conference title: Image and Signal processing  
 	  Conference chair : Desachy J.  at satellite remote sensing symposium
	5. PRESENTATION Please indicate your preference for either "oral
          presentation" or "poster presentation"
	6. KEY WORDS
	7. ABSTRACT TEXT
  	 500 words typed on white paper + eventually : full paper
	8. BRIEF BIOGRAPHY ( principal author only )
  	 50 to 100 words


ORAL PRESENTATION :

	Each author is generally allowed 25 minutes plus a five-minute discussion
period. The following media equipment is provided free of charge : 35 mm
slide projectors, overhead projectors, and electric pointers. Video and
other equipment may be rented at the speaker 's expense.

POSTER PRESENTATION :

	Interactive poster sessions will be scheduled in the evenings. Authors
will be provided with poster boards for presentation set-up. All conference
chairs encourage authors to contribute papers with technical content that
lends itself well to the poster format. Please indicate your preferemce
(oral or poster ) on the abstract.

CHAIR / AUTHOR BENEFITS :

	Authors are expected to pay a reduced registration fee. Included with a
