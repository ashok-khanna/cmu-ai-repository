Competitive pressures demand ever increasing production rates and even
tighter quality control. Before machine vision systems can achieve their
full potential in helping to meet these objectives, further improvements
are needed in resolution, speed, sophistication, cost, and ease of
application. This conference, the tenth in a series, is devoted to
advancing the state of the art in all aspects of the application of machine
vision to industrial
inspection. 

Papers are solicited in three categories, with special emphasis
on combinations of two or more aspects:

Applications and case studies, including:
* successful applications, especially those in which good systems integration
  was essential for success
* interesting or unusual solutions to some part of the overall problem,
  such as special lighting, problem reformulations leading to more effective
  solutions, novel ways of handling interprocessor communications etc.
* "network in progress" or significant unsolved problems

High-speed architectures, including:
* high-speed implementations and nonconventional configurations
* specialized processing architectures or hardware: Hough, log-polar,
  morphology, etc.
* arrays of processors; parallel decompositions of algorithms
* techniques for handling very high data rates, such as from laser scanners or
  high-speed photography
* software architectures and hierarchies

Systems integration, including:
* design aids and "advisors" for system design and configuration: optics,
  lighting, processor interconnection, I/O, etc.
* design aids and "advisors" for algorithm development, target system
  programming, and system documentation
* improved interfaces for system designers and integrators
* factory-floor interfaces for nonexpert users
* on-line applications of "intelligent" systems, neural nets etc.

          Abstract Due Date:   4 April   1994
         Manuscript Due Date: 8 August 1994*

*Note: Proceedings will be available on site. The  manuscript due date of 8
August 1994 must be strictly  observed.  

Please limit your abstract/biography submission to one page as follows:
* Title of Abstract/Paper,
* Authors' full names, company names
  (list principal author first)
  List the authors' complete addresses, and telephone/fax/telex numbers.
* Placement
  Please indicate that your abstract is intended for the conference on 
  Machine Vision Applications, Architectures, and Systems Integration III
  (Batchelor, Solomon, Waltz) at OE/Technology '94 and whether the
  presentation is oral or a poster.
* Abstract text
  The abstract should be 200 words typed on white paper and should contain
  enough detail to clearly convey the approach and the results of the research.
  Government and company clearance to present and publish should be
  final at the time of submission.  

* Brief biography: 50 to 100 words (principal author only)
  Include, on the same page, a brief (50-100 words) biographical sketch.

Abstract due by 4 April 1994 :
*Send abstract via email to abstracts@mom.spie.org (ASCII format)
*or fax one copy to SPIE at 206-647-1445.

Condition of Acceptance: Authors are expected to secure travel and
accommodation funding, independent of SPIE, through their sponsoring
organizations before submitting abstracts.

Placement: Submissions may be placed in an oral or poster session at
the chair's discretion.  Applicants will be notified of acceptance by
20 June 1994.

Proceedings of these meetings: These meetings will result in published
Proceedings that can be ordered through the Advance Program.  Manuscripts
are required of all accepted applicants and must be submitted in English by
8 August 1994 on SPIE-provided paper.  Copyright to the manuscript is
expected to be released for publication in the conference Proceedings.

NOTE: If an author does not attend the meeting and make a presentation, the
chair may opt not to publish the author's manuscript in the conference
proceedings.

Proceedings papers are indexed in the leading scientific databases,
including INSPEC, Compendex plus, Physics Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts,
International Aerospace Abtracts and Index to Scientific and Technical
Proceedings.

Publishing Policy: Manuscript dates must be strictly observed. Whether the
Proceedings volume will be published before or after the meeting, late
manuscripts run the risk of not being published. The objective of this
policy is to serve the conference participants and the technical community
at large. Your cooperation in supporting this objective will be appreciated
by all.

Paper Review: Commercial papers, descriptions of papers with no
research content, and papers where supporting data or a technical
description cannot be given for proprietary reasons will not be
accepted for presentation in this symposium.  To assure a high-quality
conference, all abstracts and Proceedings papers will be reviewed by
the Conference Chairs for technical merit and content.

Poster Presentation: Interactive poster sessions will be scheduled. All
conference chairs encourage authors to contribute papers with a technical
content  that lends itself well to the poster format. Please indicate your
preference on the abstratc

Oral Presentation: Each author is generally allowed 15 minutes plus a
5-minute discussion period.  SPIE will provide the following media
equipment free of charge: 35 mm carousel slide projectors, overhead
projectors, and electric pointers.  Additional equipment may be
arranged by SPIE at the speaker's expense.

Author Benefits: An author or co-author be accorded a reduced-rate
registration fee.  Included with fee payment are a copy of the Proceedings
in which the author's paper appears, a complimentary one-year nonvoting
membership in SPIE (if never before a member), and other special benefits.
