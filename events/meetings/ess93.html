========================================================================
                              VENUE: DELFT
========================================================================

General
-------

Delft is one of the best preserved old Dutch cities. It is not far from
The Hague (10 km), Rotterdam (15 km) and Amsterdam (60 km), which all can
be reached from Delft by train (every 15 minutes). Delft is famous for its
canals, historical buildings, and its New Church with the crypt of the
Royal Family and the Mausoleum of Prince William I (the architect of the
Dutch independence). At the Royal Delftware Factory "De Porceleyne Fles",
one can visit the splendid permanent exhibition and attend handpainting
demonstrations. Delft can be reached from Schiphol Airport (one of
Europe's mainports) by train in about 40 minutes.


Historical Town
---------------

The old inner city of Delft, which was enfranchised in 1246, still bears
the marks of its glorious history. The past comes to life as you stroll
along the stately mansions, by quiet courts of almshouses and through the
alleys interconnecting the canals. Its cosy character and monumental
buildings in various styles have been carefully preserved. The Eastern
Gate, the 'Gemeenlandshuis' and the 'Armamentarium' are fine examples of
architectural masterpieces from the days of yore. The marketsquare is
dominated by the Town Hall and the impressive New Church, with in between
them the statue of Hugo de Groot, better known as Grotius. Other famous
natives of Delft, such as the painter Johannes Vermeer, are buried in the
Old Church, where extraordinary stained-glass windows catch the eye. In
eight museums old works of art and cultural treasures illustrate the
national history as well as that of Delft.


Town of Princes
---------------

Delft has special ties with the Dutch Royal House, more so than any other
city in the Netherlands. This connection dates from the turbulent times
in which prince William of Orange (1533-1584), the 'Father of the
Fatherland', thought himself safe behind the town ramparts of the Cloister
of Saint Agatha. He and his court had frequently stayed here since 1572
and he was assassinated here in 1584. The bullet holes are still visible
in the present Municipal Museum the 'Prinsenhof'. The prince's marble
mausoleum (1614-1622) can be admired in the New Church, over the vaults
of the Royal Family. In the church an exhibition has been organized on the
Royal funerals. The collection of the Royal Dutch Army and Arms Museum in
the old armoury the 'Armamentarium' shows, among other things, the genesis
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the significant parts that have been
played by the House of Orange as well as Delft.  Town of Delftware Delft
is renowned all over the world as the city of Delft blue arthenware. This
is also based on an age-old history. In the 17th century, the 'Golden
Age', dozens of small potteries came into existence in Delft at places
which formerly accommodated breweries. Delft was one of the home ports of
the VOC, the Dutch East Indian company. When the Delft potters became
acquainted with the imported Chinese porcelain, they began manufacturing
earthenware with designs based on these patterns. Dutch porcelain, for
that matter, is also decorated in beautiful multi-coloured shades. In
several workshops, including that of 'De Porceleyne Fles', the only
surviving 17th century factory, Delftware is manufactured and hand-painted
according to traditional methods. You're welcome to attend the
demonstrations which are held regularly. In Museum Lambert van Meerten you
will find a unique collection of tiles, tile pictures, porcelain and
earthenware in original period rooms. Delft, the university town, is
famous for the lively atmosphere in its historic centre. Countless numbers
of visitors enjoy its charming little shops, galleries, pubs, grand cafes,
(gourmet) restaurants and cosy outdoor cafes on the market square and
along the canals. During the summer there are various festivals, the
barrel organ plays and terrace boats in the canals offer refreshments. The
canals may also be explored by way of round-trip boats, pedal boats or
canoes. An original horse-drawn tram will take you around the old city
centre. For guided walking tours of the city you can call the VVV Tourist
Information Office. And then we have the markets: the big commodities
market on the Markt and colourful flower markets as well as the popular
flea market with its antiques and curiosa along the canals. This is
something you shouldn't miss, if only for the cheerful ambience.


Delft University of Technology
------------------------------

Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is one of the largest technical
universities in Western Europe with 12 Faculties, a teaching and research
staff of 1400, a support staff of 2400, and 13000 students. The university

========================================================================
                            CONFERENCE THEMES
========================================================================

The 1993 SCS European Simulation Symposium is structured around four major
themes: applications of simulation in information systems, simulation
aspects of multimedia systems and virtual reality, high-performance
computing and simulation, and new trends in simulation methods and tools.
A parallel track will be devoted to each of the four topics.

1.    Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems
Simulation is a fruitful approach for analyzing dynamic aspects of
information systems, including the behaviour of actors and organizations
employing information systems. The approach recognizes that activities
happen concurrently in organizations, and that methods are needed to
adequately model concurrency. Dynamic modelling techniques are useful for
problem solving in production and administrative logistics. Topics
include:
 -    dynamic modelling of information systems
 -    CAD, CAM, CIM, CIME, CAE systems
 -    simulation and scheduling
 -    concurrent engineering techniques

2.    Multimedia Systems and Virtual Reality
Due to the decreased prices of powerful hardware and the introduction of
specialized hardware, multimedia systems and virtual reality are currently
in the focus of attention. As virtual reality has many aspects in common
with simulation, and as simulation output and model building can benefit
highly from multimedia technology, papers on the following topics are
present:
 -    multimedia, hypermedia, data compression / fusion
 -    virtual reality techniques and applications
 -    simulation in education and training
 -    simulation in entertainment and gaming

3.    High-Performance Computing and Simulation
Much research is spent nowadays on methods, algorithms and software for
parallel and distributed hardware. There are strong relations between
simulation and parallel processing. In large-scale, complex and real-time
simulation, parallel processing is used to increase performance. On the
other hand, simulation is useful in the analysis and evaluation of
parallel processes. Conference topics include:
 -    parallel methods in (continuous, discrete) simulation
 -    software tools for simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    applications of simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    simulation of (massively) parallel processes

4.    New Trends in Methods and Tools
More and more fields recognize the importance of simulation nowadays.
Conversely, other disciplines are being introduced into the simulation
field such as graphics and knowledge engineering. This sets new goals for
simulation methods and tools. The integration of simulation and artificial
intelligence, object oriented analysis and design, visualisation
technology, and other fields, remain relatively unexplored. Topics:
 -    methods and techniques in simulation
 -    (object-oriented) simulation software tools, advanced environments
 -    DBMS, AI and neural networks in simulation
 -    iconics, animation, graphics, scientific visualisation

Simulation in EC projects
-------------------------

A session will be organized dealing with simulation in some EC projects.


========================================================================
                          SHORT PAPER SESSIONS
========================================================================

In addition to the full paper program, the 1993 European Simulation
Symposium will have short paper sessions as well. Short papers are an
ideal way to present current research that is not yet mature enough to be
included in the official conference proceedings.
The short papers will be published in separate Short Paper Proceedings,
which will be distributed among all conference participants.

=========================================================================
                            BEST PAPER AWARDS
========================================================================

The 1993 European Simulation Symposium will award the best four papers,
one in each of the four tracks. From these four papers, the best overall
paper of the conference will be chosen. The selection procedure will be
as follows: The Program Committee nominates the four best papers in each
track. The 16 chosen papers will be presented in a special Paper Award
Session (Tuesday afternoon), where the presentation of the paper and the
response to questions will be judged as well. In each track, one paper
will be chosen as best paper of that track. The awarded papers will be
selected for publication in an International Journal, if necessary after
incorporating modifications in the paper.

The Program Committee chooses the overall best paper of the conference
from these four papers. The author of the best paper will be awarded at
the conference dinner.

problem-puzzling environment of logistics management the relative
inefficiency of the split approaches of simulation and optimization (in
casu mathematical programming).
An animated, interactively controlled shop floor simulation game with a
continuously running clock (programmed in OS/2) will be available for each
group of 2 participants. Participants are requested to solve a simple
multi-product, multi-machine, multi-line loading and scheduling task
within certain commercial and financial restrictions.
Furthermore, we will show how one can easily teach in this way the
concepts of cash-flow, costing, profit and loss statements, and balance-
sheets to engineering and post-graduate students in management.
This year, the workshop has already been run at the Universities of Ghent
(Belgium), Karlsruhe (Germany), Lyngby (Denmark), Riga (Latvia), and
others.

Biography : Prof. ir. Henri Muller (-Malek) (1932) obtained the university
degrees of electromechanical engineer from the University of Ghent and of
mechanical engineer in production management from Delft University of
Technology. He is the initiator and has been for 30 years the permanent
coordinator of the postgraduate studies in "Industrial Management and
Management Sciences" at the University of Ghent. His recent interests are
in the field of computerized decision support systems for managerial
problem solving, in combination with expert-like simulation techniques,
heuristic programming approaches and optimization theories. In 1987, he
obtained the Francqui chair. His current position is Chairman of the
Department of Industrial Management at the School of Engineering of the
University of Ghent.

Prof.dr. Wolfgang Kreutzer (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New
Zealand): 

Title : The Role of Complexity Reduction in the Development of Simulation
Programming Tools.

Abstract : This tutorial offers a current overview of the state-of-the-art
in simulation programming from a computer science perspective. The
continuing quest for mastering computational and mental complexities of
simulation software is reviewed in a historical context and serves as a
background to a discussion of the role of object-oriented descriptions,
visual representation, concurrency, and the integration of knowledge bases
and simulation models. A summary of likely developments and research
opportunities in each of these areas concludes the presentation.

Biography : Dr. Kreutzer is associate professor of Computer Science at the
University of Canterbury in New Zealand, where he has served as head of
department from 1985 to 1991. His research interests lie in the areas of
simulation programming, object-oriented model construction and graphical
user interfaces. He has written 4 books and a large number of papers on
system simulation, artificial intelligence programming and expert systems,
and has served as the keynote speaker at the SCS 1992 Summer Simulation
Conference in Reno, USA.

Prof.dr. Francois Cellier (University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA): 

Title : Mixed Quantitative and Qualitative Modelling and Simulation.

Abstract : Both quantitative and qualitative models can be either
deductively or inductively constructed. A general methodology for
qualitative inductive modelling of dynamical processes was recently
developed; the approach has been named Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR).
It turns out that FIR models are quite compatible with quantitative
deductive models. Thus, mixed models can be constructed whereby the
well-understood subsystems can be modeled using quantitative deductive
(differential equation) models, whereas the poorly-understood subsystems
are described using qualitative inductive (FIR) models. Applications of
this methodlogy are manyfold. A number of them will be considered in this
tutorial.

                           Monday, October 25


1. Open meeting of the Esprit Special Interest Group "Simulation in
Europe" (SiE)

Monday afternoon, October 25, an open meeting of the Esprit SIG
"Simulation in Europe" (SiE) will be held. Discussion topics will be,
among others, methodologies, standards, interfaces, ease of use, advanced
environments, high-performance simulation, and simulation in EC-funded
projects. The meeting of SiE is the more relevant since recently it became
known that the Commission of the European Communities most likely shall
fund for three years a Working Group SiE  in the framework of the Esprit
Basic Research program. The WG shall investigate the possibilities of
establishing a Europe-wide Network of Excellence in Simulation. The
operation of the WG, especially for the first phase of 6 months, will be
discussed. In this phase the focus is on improvement of modelling and
simulation processes (multiparadigm modelling concepts, multilanguage
software systems, combined discrete/continuous simulation, etc.).

========================================================================
                              VENUE: DELFT
========================================================================

General
-------

Delft is one of the best preserved old Dutch cities. It is not far from
The Hague (10 km), Rotterdam (15 km) and Amsterdam (60 km), which all can
be reached from Delft by train (every 15 minutes). Delft is famous for its
canals, historical buildings, and its New Church with the crypt of the
Royal Family and the Mausoleum of Prince William I (the architect of the
Dutch independence). At the Royal Delftware Factory "De Porceleyne Fles",
one can visit the splendid permanent exhibition and attend handpainting
demonstrations. Delft can be reached from Schiphol Airport (one of
Europe's mainports) by train in about 40 minutes.


Historical Town
---------------

The old inner city of Delft, which was enfranchised in 1246, still bears
the marks of its glorious history. The past comes to life as you stroll
along the stately mansions, by quiet courts of almshouses and through the
alleys interconnecting the canals. Its cosy character and monumental
buildings in various styles have been carefully preserved. The Eastern
Gate, the 'Gemeenlandshuis' and the 'Armamentarium' are fine examples of
architectural masterpieces from the days of yore. The marketsquare is
dominated by the Town Hall and the impressive New Church, with in between
them the statue of Hugo de Groot, better known as Grotius. Other famous
natives of Delft, such as the painter Johannes Vermeer, are buried in the
Old Church, where extraordinary stained-glass windows catch the eye. In
eight museums old works of art and cultural treasures illustrate the
national history as well as that of Delft.


Town of Princes
---------------

Delft has special ties with the Dutch Royal House, more so than any other
city in the Netherlands. This connection dates from the turbulent times
in which prince William of Orange (1533-1584), the 'Father of the
Fatherland', thought himself safe behind the town ramparts of the Cloister
of Saint Agatha. He and his court had frequently stayed here since 1572
and he was assassinated here in 1584. The bullet holes are still visible
in the present Municipal Museum the 'Prinsenhof'. The prince's marble
mausoleum (1614-1622) can be admired in the New Church, over the vaults
of the Royal Family. In the church an exhibition has been organized on the
Royal funerals. The collection of the Royal Dutch Army and Arms Museum in
the old armoury the 'Armamentarium' shows, among other things, the genesis
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the significant parts that have been
played by the House of Orange as well as Delft.  Town of Delftware Delft
is renowned all over the world as the city of Delft blue arthenware. This
is also based on an age-old history. In the 17th century, the 'Golden
Age', dozens of small potteries came into existence in Delft at places
which formerly accommodated breweries. Delft was one of the home ports of
the VOC, the Dutch East Indian company. When the Delft potters became
acquainted with the imported Chinese porcelain, they began manufacturing
earthenware with designs based on these patterns. Dutch porcelain, for
that matter, is also decorated in beautiful multi-coloured shades. In
several workshops, including that of 'De Porceleyne Fles', the only
surviving 17th century factory, Delftware is manufactured and hand-painted
according to traditional methods. You're welcome to attend the
demonstrations which are held regularly. In Museum Lambert van Meerten you
will find a unique collection of tiles, tile pictures, porcelain and
earthenware in original period rooms. Delft, the university town, is
famous for the lively atmosphere in its historic centre. Countless numbers
of visitors enjoy its charming little shops, galleries, pubs, grand cafes,
(gourmet) restaurants and cosy outdoor cafes on the market square and
along the canals. During the summer there are various festivals, the
barrel organ plays and terrace boats in the canals offer refreshments. The
canals may also be explored by way of round-trip boats, pedal boats or
canoes. An original horse-drawn tram will take you around the old city
centre. For guided walking tours of the city you can call the VVV Tourist
Information Office. And then we have the markets: the big commodities
market on the Markt and colourful flower markets as well as the popular
flea market with its antiques and curiosa along the canals. This is
something you shouldn't miss, if only for the cheerful ambience.


Delft University of Technology
------------------------------

Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is one of the largest technical
universities in Western Europe with 12 Faculties, a teaching and research
staff of 1400, a support staff of 2400, and 13000 students. The university
belongs to the leading technical universities of Europe.


Conference Location
-------------------

The conference location is the building of the Faculty of Mechanical
Engineering, where 6 adjacent lecture halls, an exhibition hall and a
restaurant together form the compact conference territory (on the ground
floor, immediately behind the main entrance of the building). Across the
road there are the Auditorium, with restaurants, a travel agency office,
a post-office, and a bank.

========================================================================
                            CONFERENCE THEMES
========================================================================

The 1993 SCS European Simulation Symposium is structured around four major
themes: applications of simulation in information systems, simulation
aspects of multimedia systems and virtual reality, high-performance
computing and simulation, and new trends in simulation methods and tools.
A parallel track will be devoted to each of the four topics.

1.    Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems
Simulation is a fruitful approach for analyzing dynamic aspects of
information systems, including the behaviour of actors and organizations
employing information systems. The approach recognizes that activities
happen concurrently in organizations, and that methods are needed to
adequately model concurrency. Dynamic modelling techniques are useful for
problem solving in production and administrative logistics. Topics
include:
 -    dynamic modelling of information systems
 -    CAD, CAM, CIM, CIME, CAE systems
 -    simulation and scheduling
 -    concurrent engineering techniques

2.    Multimedia Systems and Virtual Reality
Due to the decreased prices of powerful hardware and the introduction of
specialized hardware, multimedia systems and virtual reality are currently
in the focus of attention. As virtual reality has many aspects in common
with simulation, and as simulation output and model building can benefit
highly from multimedia technology, papers on the following topics are
present:
 -    multimedia, hypermedia, data compression / fusion
 -    virtual reality techniques and applications
 -    simulation in education and training
 -    simulation in entertainment and gaming

3.    High-Performance Computing and Simulation
Much research is spent nowadays on methods, algorithms and software for
parallel and distributed hardware. There are strong relations between
simulation and parallel processing. In large-scale, complex and real-time
simulation, parallel processing is used to increase performance. On the
other hand, simulation is useful in the analysis and evaluation of
parallel processes. Conference topics include:
 -    parallel methods in (continuous, discrete) simulation
 -    software tools for simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    applications of simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    simulation of (massively) parallel processes

4.    New Trends in Methods and Tools
More and more fields recognize the importance of simulation nowadays.
Conversely, other disciplines are being introduced into the simulation
field such as graphics and knowledge engineering. This sets new goals for
simulation methods and tools. The integration of simulation and artificial
intelligence, object oriented analysis and design, visualisation
technology, and other fields, remain relatively unexplored. Topics:
 -    methods and techniques in simulation
 -    (object-oriented) simulation software tools, advanced environments
 -    DBMS, AI and neural networks in simulation
 -    iconics, animation, graphics, scientific visualisation

Simulation in EC projects
-------------------------

A session will be organized dealing with simulation in some EC projects.


========================================================================
                          SHORT PAPER SESSIONS
========================================================================

In addition to the full paper program, the 1993 European Simulation
Symposium will have short paper sessions as well. Short papers are an
ideal way to present current research that is not yet mature enough to be
included in the official conference proceedings.
The short papers will be published in separate Short Paper Proceedings,
which will be distributed among all conference participants.

descriptions of models of dynamic systems with discontinuous behavior in
a truly reusable object-oriented fashion. Several novel high-level
constructs are introduced. The requirements for a correct compilation of
hybrid models will be discussed, and a few conceptually simple, but
numerically non-trivial examples of hybrid models will be demonstrated,
such as a mechanical body sliding on a surface with another body sliding
on top of the first one. The paper is co-authored by Hilding Elmqvist
(Sweden) and Martin Otter (Germany).

Dr. Pieter W.G. Bots (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands): 

Title : Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems

Abstract : Dynamic modelling is an approach for analyzing various aspects
of information systems, including the behaviour of actors and re-
engineering of organizations employing information systems. The approach
recognizes that activities happen concurrently in organizations, and that
methods are needed to model concurrency in information systems and
organizational systems. The expectation is that continued development of
dynamic models of information systems will lead to the solution of a
number of problems in information systems development and operation.
The objectives of the tutorial are:
 -    to show the participants the state of the art in dynamic modelling
      of information systems and organizational systems
 -    to present the modelcycle for the development of dynamic models
 -    to describe various languages and tools that are available for the
      development of dynamic models, consisting of both general and
      dedicated software
 -    to show the results of several dynamic modelling projects.

Prof.ir. Henry Muller (-Malek) (University of Ghent, Belgium): 

Title : Simulation and Optimization, not, Simulation versus Optimization

Abstract : The hands-on workshop will demonstrate in an apparently simple
problem-puzzling environment of logistics management the relative
inefficiency of the split approaches of simulation and optimization (in
casu mathematical programming).
An animated, interactively controlled shop floor simulation game with a
continuously running clock (programmed in OS/2) will be available for each
group of 2 participants. Participants are requested to solve a simple
multi-product, multi-machine, multi-line loading and scheduling task
within certain commercial and financial restrictions.
Furthermore, we will show how one can easily teach in this way the
concepts of cash-flow, costing, profit and loss statements, and balance-
sheets to engineering and post-graduate students in management.
This year, the workshop has already been run at the Universities of Ghent
(Belgium), Karlsruhe (Germany), Lyngby (Denmark), Riga (Latvia), and

Prof.dr. Wolfgang Kreutzer (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New
Zealand): 

Title : The Role of Complexity Reduction in the Development of Simulation
Programming Tools.

Abstract : This tutorial offers a current overview of the state-of-the-art
in simulation programming from a computer science perspective. The
continuing quest for mastering computational and mental complexities of
simulation software is reviewed in a historical context and serves as a
background to a discussion of the role of object-oriented descriptions,
visual representation, concurrency, and the integration of knowledge bases
and simulation models. A summary of likely developments and research
opportunities in each of these areas concludes the presentation.

Prof.dr. Francois Cellier (University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA): 

Title : Mixed Quantitative and Qualitative Modelling and Simulation.

Abstract : Both quantitative and qualitative models can be either
deductively or inductively constructed. A general methodology for
qualitative inductive modelling of dynamical processes was recently
developed; the approach has been named Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR).
It turns out that FIR models are quite compatible with quantitative
deductive models. Thus, mixed models can be constructed whereby the
well-understood subsystems can be modeled using quantitative deductive
(differential equation) models, whereas the poorly-understood subsystems
are described using qualitative inductive (FIR) models. Applications of
this methodlogy are manyfold. A number of them will be considered in this
tutorial.

========================================================================
                              VENUE: DELFT
========================================================================

General
-------

Delft is one of the best preserved old Dutch cities. It is not far from
The Hague (10 km), Rotterdam (15 km) and Amsterdam (60 km), which all can
be reached from Delft by train (every 15 minutes). Delft is famous for its
canals, historical buildings, and its New Church with the crypt of the
Royal Family and the Mausoleum of Prince William I (the architect of the
Dutch independence). At the Royal Delftware Factory "De Porceleyne Fles",
one can visit the splendid permanent exhibition and attend handpainting
demonstrations. Delft can be reached from Schiphol Airport (one of
Europe's mainports) by train in about 40 minutes.


Historical Town
---------------

The old inner city of Delft, which was enfranchised in 1246, still bears
the marks of its glorious history. The past comes to life as you stroll
along the stately mansions, by quiet courts of almshouses and through the
alleys interconnecting the canals. Its cosy character and monumental
buildings in various styles have been carefully preserved. The Eastern
Gate, the 'Gemeenlandshuis' and the 'Armamentarium' are fine examples of
architectural masterpieces from the days of yore. The marketsquare is
dominated by the Town Hall and the impressive New Church, with in between
them the statue of Hugo de Groot, better known as Grotius. Other famous
natives of Delft, such as the painter Johannes Vermeer, are buried in the
Old Church, where extraordinary stained-glass windows catch the eye. In
eight museums old works of art and cultural treasures illustrate the
national history as well as that of Delft.


Town of Princes
---------------

Delft has special ties with the Dutch Royal House, more so than any other
city in the Netherlands. This connection dates from the turbulent times
in which prince William of Orange (1533-1584), the 'Father of the
Fatherland', thought himself safe behind the town ramparts of the Cloister
of Saint Agatha. He and his court had frequently stayed here since 1572
and he was assassinated here in 1584. The bullet holes are still visible
in the present Municipal Museum the 'Prinsenhof'. The prince's marble
mausoleum (1614-1622) can be admired in the New Church, over the vaults
of the Royal Family. In the church an exhibition has been organized on the
Royal funerals. The collection of the Royal Dutch Army and Arms Museum in
the old armoury the 'Armamentarium' shows, among other things, the genesis
of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the significant parts that have been
played by the House of Orange as well as Delft.  Town of Delftware Delft
is renowned all over the world as the city of Delft blue arthenware. This
is also based on an age-old history. In the 17th century, the 'Golden
Age', dozens of small potteries came into existence in Delft at places
which formerly accommodated breweries. Delft was one of the home ports of
the VOC, the Dutch East Indian company. When the Delft potters became
acquainted with the imported Chinese porcelain, they began manufacturing
earthenware with designs based on these patterns. Dutch porcelain, for
that matter, is also decorated in beautiful multi-coloured shades. In
several workshops, including that of 'De Porceleyne Fles', the only
surviving 17th century factory, Delftware is manufactured and hand-painted
according to traditional methods. You're welcome to attend the
demonstrations which are held regularly. In Museum Lambert van Meerten you
will find a unique collection of tiles, tile pictures, porcelain and
earthenware in original period rooms. Delft, the university town, is
famous for the lively atmosphere in its historic centre. Countless numbers
of visitors enjoy its charming little shops, galleries, pubs, grand cafes,
(gourmet) restaurants and cosy outdoor cafes on the market square and
along the canals. During the summer there are various festivals, the
barrel organ plays and terrace boats in the canals offer refreshments. The
canals may also be explored by way of round-trip boats, pedal boats or
canoes. An original horse-drawn tram will take you around the old city
centre. For guided walking tours of the city you can call the VVV Tourist
Information Office. And then we have the markets: the big commodities
market on the Markt and colourful flower markets as well as the popular
flea market with its antiques and curiosa along the canals. This is
something you shouldn't miss, if only for the cheerful ambience.


Delft University of Technology
------------------------------

Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is one of the largest technical
universities in Western Europe with 12 Faculties, a teaching and research
staff of 1400, a support staff of 2400, and 13000 students. The university
belongs to the leading technical universities of Europe.


Conference Location
-------------------

The conference location is the building of the Faculty of Mechanical
Engineering, where 6 adjacent lecture halls, an exhibition hall and a
restaurant together form the compact conference territory (on the ground

========================================================================
                            CONFERENCE THEMES
========================================================================

The 1993 SCS European Simulation Symposium is structured around four major
themes: applications of simulation in information systems, simulation
aspects of multimedia systems and virtual reality, high-performance
computing and simulation, and new trends in simulation methods and tools.
A parallel track will be devoted to each of the four topics.

1.    Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems
Simulation is a fruitful approach for analyzing dynamic aspects of
information systems, including the behaviour of actors and organizations
employing information systems. The approach recognizes that activities
happen concurrently in organizations, and that methods are needed to
adequately model concurrency. Dynamic modelling techniques are useful for
problem solving in production and administrative logistics. Topics
include:
 -    dynamic modelling of information systems
 -    CAD, CAM, CIM, CIME, CAE systems
 -    simulation and scheduling
 -    concurrent engineering techniques

2.    Multimedia Systems and Virtual Reality
Due to the decreased prices of powerful hardware and the introduction of
specialized hardware, multimedia systems and virtual reality are currently
in the focus of attention. As virtual reality has many aspects in common
with simulation, and as simulation output and model building can benefit
highly from multimedia technology, papers on the following topics are
present:
 -    multimedia, hypermedia, data compression / fusion
 -    virtual reality techniques and applications
 -    simulation in education and training
 -    simulation in entertainment and gaming

3.    High-Performance Computing and Simulation
Much research is spent nowadays on methods, algorithms and software for
parallel and distributed hardware. There are strong relations between
simulation and parallel processing. In large-scale, complex and real-time
simulation, parallel processing is used to increase performance. On the
other hand, simulation is useful in the analysis and evaluation of
parallel processes. Conference topics include:
 -    parallel methods in (continuous, discrete) simulation
 -    software tools for simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    applications of simulation on parallel and distributed hardware
 -    simulation of (massively) parallel processes

4.    New Trends in Methods and Tools
More and more fields recognize the importance of simulation nowadays.
Conversely, other disciplines are being introduced into the simulation
field such as graphics and knowledge engineering. This sets new goals for
simulation methods and tools. The integration of simulation and artificial
intelligence, object oriented analysis and design, visualisation
technology, and other fields, remain relatively unexplored. Topics:
 -    methods and techniques in simulation
 -    (object-oriented) simulation software tools, advanced environments
 -    DBMS, AI and neural networks in simulation
 -    iconics, animation, graphics, scientific visualisation

Simulation in EC projects
-------------------------

A session will be organized dealing with simulation in some EC projects.


========================================================================
                          SHORT PAPER SESSIONS
========================================================================

In addition to the full paper program, the 1993 European Simulation
Symposium will have short paper sessions as well. Short papers are an
ideal way to present current research that is not yet mature enough to be
included in the official conference proceedings.
The short papers will be published in separate Short Paper Proceedings,
which will be distributed among all conference participants.

=========================================================================
                            BEST PAPER AWARDS
========================================================================

The 1993 European Simulation Symposium will award the best four papers,
one in each of the four tracks. From these four papers, the best overall
paper of the conference will be chosen. The selection procedure will be
as follows: The Program Committee nominates the four best papers in each
track. The 16 chosen papers will be presented in a special Paper Award
Session (Tuesday afternoon), where the presentation of the paper and the
response to questions will be judged as well. In each track, one paper
will be chosen as best paper of that track. The awarded papers will be
selected for publication in an International Journal, if necessary after
incorporating modifications in the paper.

The Program Committee chooses the overall best paper of the conference
from these four papers. The author of the best paper will be awarded at
the conference dinner.

Dr. Pieter W.G. Bots (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands):

Title : Dynamic Modelling and Information Systems

Abstract : Dynamic modelling is an approach for analyzing various aspects
of information systems, including the behaviour of actors and re-
engineering of organizations employing information systems. The approach
recognizes that activities happen concurrently in organizations, and that
methods are needed to model concurrency in information systems and
organizational systems. The expectation is that continued development of
dynamic models of information systems will lead to the solution of a
number of problems in information systems development and operation.
The objectives of the tutorial are:
 -    to show the participants the state of the art in dynamic modelling
      of information systems and organizational systems
 -    to present the modelcycle for the development of dynamic models
 -    to describe various languages and tools that are available for the
      development of dynamic models, consisting of both general and
      dedicated software
 -    to show the results of several dynamic modelling projects.

Prof.ir. Henry Muller (-Malek) (University of Ghent, Belgium):

Title : Simulation and Optimization, not, Simulation versus Optimization

Abstract : The hands-on workshop will demonstrate in an apparently simple
problem-puzzling environment of logistics management the relative
inefficiency of the split approaches of simulation and optimization (in
casu mathematical programming).
An animated, interactively controlled shop floor simulation game with a
continuously running clock (programmed in OS/2) will be available for each
group of 2 participants. Participants are requested to solve a simple
multi-product, multi-machine, multi-line loading and scheduling task
within certain commercial and financial restrictions.
Furthermore, we will show how one can easily teach in this way the
concepts of cash-flow, costing, profit and loss statements, and balance-
sheets to engineering and post-graduate students in management.
This year, the workshop has already been run at the Universities of Ghent
(Belgium), Karlsruhe (Germany), Lyngby (Denmark), Riga (Latvia), and
others.

Biography : Prof. ir. Henri Muller (-Malek) (1932) obtained the university
degrees of electromechanical engineer from the University of Ghent and of

Prof.dr. Wolfgang Kreutzer (University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New
Zealand):

Title : The Role of Complexity Reduction in the Development of Simulation
Programming Tools.

Abstract : This tutorial offers a current overview of the state-of-the-art
in simulation programming from a computer science perspective. The
continuing quest for mastering computational and mental complexities of
simulation software is reviewed in a historical context and serves as a
background to a discussion of the role of object-oriented descriptions,
visual representation, concurrency, and the integration of knowledge bases
and simulation models. A summary of likely developments and research
opportunities in each of these areas concludes the presentation.

Biography : Dr. Kreutzer is associate professor of Computer Science at the
University of Canterbury in New Zealand, where he has served as head of
department from 1985 to 1991. His research interests lie in the areas of
simulation programming, object-oriented model construction and graphical
user interfaces. He has written 4 books and a large number of papers on
system simulation, artificial intelligence programming and expert systems,
and has served as the keynote speaker at the SCS 1992 Summer Simulation
Conference in Reno, USA.

Prof.dr. Francois Cellier (University of Arizona, Tucson AZ, USA):

Title : Mixed Quantitative and Qualitative Modelling and Simulation.

Abstract : Both quantitative and qualitative models can be either
deductively or inductively constructed. A general methodology for
qualitative inductive modelling of dynamical processes was recently
developed; the approach has been named Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR).
It turns out that FIR models are quite compatible with quantitative
deductive models. Thus, mixed models can be constructed whereby the
well-understood subsystems can be modeled using quantitative deductive
(differential equation) models, whereas the poorly-understood subsystems
are described using qualitative inductive (FIR) models. Applications of
this methodlogy are manyfold. A number of them will be considered in this
tutorial.

                           Monday, October 25


1. Open meeting of the Esprit Special Interest Group "Simulation in
Europe" (SiE)

Monday afternoon, October 25, an open meeting of the Esprit SIG
"Simulation in Europe" (SiE) will be held. Discussion topics will be,
among others, methodologies, standards, interfaces, ease of use, advanced
environments, high-performance simulation, and simulation in EC-funded
projects. The meeting of SiE is the more relevant since recently it became
known that the Commission of the European Communities most likely shall
fund for three years a Working Group SiE  in the framework of the Esprit
Basic Research program. The WG shall investigate the possibilities of
establishing a Europe-wide Network of Excellence in Simulation. The
operation of the WG, especially for the first phase of 6 months, will be
discussed. In this phase the focus is on improvement of modelling and
simulation processes (multiparadigm modelling concepts, multilanguage
software systems, combined discrete/continuous simulation, etc.).
