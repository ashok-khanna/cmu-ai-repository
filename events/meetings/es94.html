                  BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY
            SPECIALIST GROUP ON EXPERT SYSTEMS (SGES)


          ANNUAL CONFERENCE - EXPERT SYSTEMS '94 (ES94)

                         CALL FOR PAPERS


Expert  Systems  '94,  the fourteenth  annual  conference  of  the 
British Computer Society Specialist Group on Expert Systems,  will 
be held in Cambridge from December 12th-14th 1994.

A TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
Following  the  Group's  previous successful  conferences,  it  is 
intended to continue in a similar format of a technical conference 
with the principal aim of reviewing recent advances in  knowledge-
based systems technologies and their successful application. 
It is expected that the programme will 
have  wide  appeal  to the  industrial,  commercial  and  academic 
communities.  We  plan that, once again, the  conference  will  be 
supported   by  a  number  of  in-depth  tutorials  and  a   small 
exhibition.

As  before,  the  conference  will  have  separate  technical  and 
applications  streams.  

For the Technical Stream,
contributions  are  invited in the form of papers of up  to  5,000 
words  on knowledge-based systems and related areas of  artificial 
intelligence. Papers representing original work on theoretical and 
applied AI relating to: constraint satisfaction; knowledge engineering
methods; machine learning; model based reasoning; natural language 
understanding; verification and validation of KBS; case-based reasoning
and other related areas are welcome.

For the Applications Stream, 
contributions  are  invited in the form of papers of up  to  5,000
words presenting case studies of knowledge based systems that address
real-world problems
such as:
diagnosis, monitoring, scheduling and selection. Most importantly,
the papers should highlight the critical elements of success and 
the lessons learned.

Papers submitted to both streams  will  be 
refereed  and  it is expected that those accepted  will  again  be 
published in book form in the 'Research and Development in  Expert 
Systems'  and  'Applications and Innovations  in  Expert  Systems' 
series (for the technical and application streams respectively).

To assist us with our planning of the conference, anyone intending 
to submit a paper should provide a short abstract, with title,  at 
the earliest opportunity to the appropriate Programme Chairman:

Technical Stream: Professor Max Bramer, Department of  Information 
Science, University of Portsmouth, Locksway Road, Milton, Southsea  
PO4 8JF  (email: bramerma@uk.ac.port.cv).

Applications Stream: Dr. Rob Milne, Intelligent Applications Ltd., 
Kirkton Business Centre, Kirk Lane, Livingston, 
West Lothian  EH54 7AY  (email: rmilne@uk.co.compulink.cix).

Please  include  your full name and postal address  in  any  email 
submissions.  Formatting instructions for your paper will be  sent 
as soon as your title and abstract are received.

Four paper copies of papers should be submitted to arrive no later 
than  Friday  24th  June 1994 (the address  to  which  submissions 
should be sent will be included with the formatting instructions).

All  enquiries about the conference should be directed to  one  of 
the above or the Conference Chairman:

     Ann Macintosh
     AIAI
     University of Edinburgh
     80 South Bridge
     Edinburgh
     EH1 1HN

     (tel: +44 (0)31 650 2732  email: A.Macintosh@uk.ac.ed)

as appropriate.

Please   note  that  presenters of submitted papers  will  be 
asked  to cover their costs of attending the conference by  paying 
at the SGES members' academic rate.

Tutorials & Exhibition

We would also be pleased to hear from you if you have ideas for  a 
half-day  tutorial  or  would like to provide  a  product  display 
(exhibit).   For  further  information  contact   the   Conference 
Chairman.

Sponsorship

We  are also keen to make contact with any organisations  who  may 
wish to sponsor the conference, in whole or in part.   Sponsorship 
of  an  international  conference such as  ES94  will  ensure  the 
highest visibility for the benefactor, both through the appearance 
of  the  company  logo  on  all  promotional  literature  and   in 
references  to the Conference in all media exposure prior  to  and 
after  the event. Please call the Conference Chairman for  further 
details.
