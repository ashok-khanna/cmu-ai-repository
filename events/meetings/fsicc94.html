                            SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

     THIRD INTERNATIONAL FUZZY SYSTEMS AND INTELLIGENT CONTROL CONFERENCE

                               Louisville KY USA
                               14-16 March 1994

This conference is devoted primarily to computer based feedback control
systems that rely on fuzzy logic, neural network theory, probabilistic
reasoning techniques, genetic algorithms, chaos theory, learning theory, and
other soft computing and artificial intelligence techniques.

The theme of this year's conference is "Industrial Applications of Soft
Computing."

In an abstract of a paper on soft computing, Lotfi Zadeh wrote:

      The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth of interest in
      novel modes of computation which are collectively referred to as
      soft computing.  The distinguishing characteristic of soft
      computing is that its primary aim is to exploit the tolerance for
      imprecision and uncertainty to achieve tractability, robustness
      and low cost.  Thus, in soft computing what is usually sought is
      an approximate solution to a precisely formulated problem or, more
      typically, an approximate solution to an imprecisely formulated
      problem.  A simple case in point is the problem of parking a car.
      Generally, a car can be parked rather easily because the final
      position of the car is not specified exactly.  If it were
      specified to within, say, a fraction of a millimeter and a few
      seconds of arc, it would take hours or days of maneuvering and
      precise measurements of distance and angular position to solve the
      problem.  What this simple example points to is the fact that, in
      general, high precision carries a high cost.  The challenge, then,
      is to exploit the tolerance for imprecision by devising methods of
      computation which lead to an acceptable solution at low cost.
      This, in essence, is the guiding principle of soft computing.  At
      this juncture, the major components of soft computing are fuzzy
      logic (FL), neural network theory (NN) and probabilistic reasoning
      techniques (PR), including genetic algorithms, chaos theory and
      parts of learning theory.  It may be argued that it is soft
      computing - rather than hard computing - that should be viewed as
      the foundation for artificial intelligence.  In the years ahead,
      this may well become a widely held position.

Some of the areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

      Adaptive vector quantization        Modeling
      Chaos theory                        Neural control
      Differential competitive learning   Neuro-fuzzy control
      Expert control                      Operating experience
      Fuzzy control                       Process control
      Genetic algorithm control           Rule completeness
      Geno-fuzzy control                  Rule consistency
      Identification                      Rule interaction
      Implementation                      Self-organizing controllers
      Learning theory                     Soft computing
      Machine learning                    Soft computing for control
      Membership function elicitation     Statistical process control

This conference is sponsored by the Institution for Fuzzy Systems and
Intelligent Control.
