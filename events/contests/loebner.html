               INTERNATIONAL QUEST FOR THINKING COMPUTER
                        TO BE HELD IN SAN DIEGO
                (Human vs. Computers on December 16th)
 
     In the near future, human beings may be joined by an equally
intelligent species -- computers so smart that they can truly think,
converse, and perhaps even feel.
 
     To expedite the search for the first member of this new species,
the fourth annual Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence
will be held at the new San Marcos campus of California State University
on Friday, December 16th, 1994.  The Loebner Prize pits humans against
computers in what the Wall Street Journal described as "a groundbreaking
battle."  The first three competitions drew national and international
media coverage.
 
     In the event, human judges converse at computer terminals and
attempt to determine which terminals are controlled by fellow humans and
which by computers.  For the 1994 competition, conversation will be
restricted to certain topics.  This year, as in 1993, all judges will be
members of the national press.  The 1993 judges represented TIME
Magazine, Popular Science, PBS, the Voice of America, and elsewhere.  The
contest has drawn media attention around the world, including coverage on
CNN television, PBS television, the New York Times (front page), the
Washington Post, the London Guardian, The Economist, the San Diego Union
Tribune (front page), Science News, and many periodicals in the computer
field, including Computerworld and AI Magazine (cover story).
 
     "Surprisingly, in early competitions, some of the computers fooled
some of the judges into thinking they were people," said Dr. Robert
Epstein, Research Professor at National University, Director Emeritus of
the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, and the organizer and
director of the three previous contests.
 
     The author of the winning software of this year's event will receive
$2,000 and a bronze medal.  In 1995, Epstein said, the first open-ended
contest -- one with no topic restrictions -- will be conducted.  When a
computer can pass an unrestricted test, the grand prize of $100,000 will
be awarded, and the contest will be discontinued.
 
     The competition is named after benefactor Dr. Hugh G. Loebner of New
York City and was inspired by computer pioneer Alan Turing, who in 1950
proposed a test like the Loebner contest as a way to answer the question:
Can computers think?
 
     A partial list of sponsors of previous competitions includes:  Apple
Computers, Computerland, Crown Industries, GDE Systems, IBM Personal
Computer Company's Center for Natural Computing, Greenwich Capital
Markets, Motorola, the National Science Foundation, The Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, and The Weingart Foundation.
 
     Application guidelines:  Official rules and an application may be
obtained via email by sending a message to "loebner@coyote.csusm.edu"
with the subject line of the message reading "send nnnnn" where "nnnnn"
is one of the files listed below.  The body of the message should be
empty.  The files that can be requested are:

	info-letter     (a short introduction)
        order-form      (an order form for transcripts and diskettes)
        press-release   (this document)
        official-rules  (official rules and application)
        technical-notes (technical notes for the contest)
        all             (all of the above documents)
 

Those with access to the web can access this information at

Those without access to either email or the web can contact:

Dr. Robert Epstein, Contest Director 
933 Woodlake Drive, 
Cardiff by the Sea, CA 92007-1009  
Tel: 619-436-4400, Fax: 619-436-4490.

  *  The deadline for receipt of applications is November 1, 1994.  
  *  Applications must be accompanied by printed protocols recording actual 
     interaction between the system to be entered and one or more humans.  
     The protocols may not exceed ten double-spaced pages.  
  *  Applications must specify a single domain of discourse in which the 
     computer system is proficient.  The domain must be expressed by an 
     English phrase containing no more than five words.  
  *  Each entry must communicate using approximations of natural English, 
     and it must be prepared to communicate for an indefinite period of 
     time.  
  *  Computer entries may contain standard or customized hardware and 
     software.  The hardware may be of any type as long as it is inorganic 
     and as long as its replies are not controlled by humans responding in 
     real time to the judges' inputs.  
  *  Entrants must be prepared to interface their systems to standard 
     computer terminals over telephone lines at 2400 baud.  
  *  The prize will be awarded if there is at least one entry.
 
     Advance notice of new guidelines for 1995:  The 1995 event will be
an unrestricted Turing Test, requiring computer entries to be able to
converse for an indefinite period of time with no topic restrictions.  In
1995, entries may be required to run on hardware located at the
competition site.
 
     For further information:  Complete transcripts and IBM-compatible
diskettes that play the 1991, 1992, and 1993 conversations in real-time
are available for purchase from the Cambridge Center for Behavioral
Studies (tel: 617-491-9020, fax 1072; e-mail: 76557.1175@compuserve.com).
Sponsorship opportunities are available.
