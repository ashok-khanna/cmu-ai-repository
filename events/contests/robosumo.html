A ftp site has been established which contains the official rules for
the Robot Sumo contest (as set by Fuji Software of Japan) together with
an evolving FAQ on rules interpertation.

The site is ftp/pub/rowley at netcom.com (sorry I didn't get a more
descriptive directory name)

Also posted is the agenda for events at the San Francisco Robotics Society's
Robot Sumo Competition to be held at San Jose State University on 
May 1, 1994 

For more info or to add to the FAQ, please e-mail rowley@netcom.com
