			***** PURPOSE *****
	To test the performance of nonlinear technologies and machine 
intelligence applied to making financial predictions in an independent 
environment, to analyze and distribute results, and to establish a 
foundation for future work. Future work will include the test and analysis 
of these technologies applied to actual trading systems in a separate 
Competition. We are also encouraging a limited number of entries that 
use linear and semi-linear techniques.

	The following Distinguished Panel of Analysts will analyze and 
judge results of the Competition:

	E. Michael Azoff, Themisto Numerics Ltd. UK

   In order to qualify for registration and be provided with the necessary
data, you must provide all of the information listed below before the 
registration deadline, including a completed copy of the DATA AGREEMENT 
(see Rule 9). 
   Entrants must provide a Paper and the completed Copyright Transfer form 
according to the Paper Submission rules outlined below prior to the Paper 
Submission deadline in October. Otherwise, they will be disqualified.
   Information to be provided by the registration deadline:  
   
   (Provide by postal mail only):
	Completed copy of the DATA AGREEMENT

   (Provide by email or postal mail):
	Name
	Postal address
	Email address 
	Telephone numbers (voice and fax)
	Affiliations
	Biographic sketch (curriculum vitae - brief version)
	Qualifications
	Track (Scientific or Professional)
	Prediction Strategy: Tracking 1 or 2 (see FORECASTING)
	Fees (if applicable, see FEES)
	Overview (500 words) of the model to be applied in the Competition
	Computer platform (software and hardware)

2. FEES:  
   There is no fee to register as a Scientific entry. 
   Professional entries must make arrangements with the INFFC for the
testing of their software prior to registration. Professional entries
must include with Registration a check (U.S. dollars on a U.S. bank) or 
international postal money order for $200.00 made payable to:
	NEUROVE$T JOURNAL, P.O. Box 764, Haymarket, VA 22069 USA.
Fees submitted are non-refundable.

3. FORECASTING:
   All entrants must use ONLY the data provided to them by the INFFC to 
train, develop, test and apply any tools to be used in the Competition,
and to make specific predictions for the financial time series to be made 
available.
   Two Prediction Strategies will be accepted:
	Overview: Periodic data will be provided to the prediction system, 
	      which will update its input variables and submit its prediction
	      (Tracking Method 1) or position (Tracking Method 2). Learn from 
	      a training set, then predict a future point (Tracking Method 1) 
	      or take a position (Tracking Method 2) at every minute in the 
	      series.
	Procedure: Find f() so that:
	      x^(t+T) = f(x(t),x(t-d),...,x(t-dm)) 
	      for some distance T, delta d, and input size m+1; 
	      and with respect to one of the metrics below.
	(1)  Tracking Method 1 (prediction metric): 
	      Metric: nRMSE: root-mean-squared-error between the actual
	      and the predicted values, normalized by the standard 
	      deviation of the actual values.
	      Software entries will provide values for x^(t+T).
	(2)  Tracking Method 2 (simulated trading metric):
	      Metric: Sharpe ratio: monthly gains minus a 
	      risk-free-interest-rate, normalized by the standard 
	      deviation of the gains. 
	      Based on x^(t+T) for any values of T > 0, software entries 
	      will provide one of three values for s(t+1); where 
	      s(t+1) = {1,-1,0} = market position to be taken at the CLOSE
	      of the next minute; and where 1 = long position,
	      -1 = short position and 0 = neutral position. Gains will be 
	      computed based on market positions, price variations and 
	      change-in-position costs. A single objective function will be
	      provided to entrants.

   A more detailed description will be provided to registered entrants 
along with the delivery of the data.
