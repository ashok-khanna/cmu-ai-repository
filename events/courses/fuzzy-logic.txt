Introduced by Lotfi Zadeh, Fuzzy Logic methods may be used to 
design intelligent systems utilizing knowledge expressed in natural 
language.  This methodology, an important source of artificial 
intelligence applications, permits the processing of both symbolic 
and numerical information.  Fuzzy logic has been applied to control 
trains (Sendai subway), elevators, household appliances, cameras, and 
manufacturing processes.  Systems designed and developed utilizing 
fuzzy-logic methods have been shown to be more efficient than those 
based on conventional approaches.  In combination with Computational 
Neural Networks techniques, fuzzy-logic methods may be used to design 
robust adaptive control systems.  

This course discusses the application of fuzzy logic and neural 
networks techniques to the design of fuzzy and hybrid neuro-fuzzy 
systems.  More than 11 case studies will be discussed in detail.  At
the completion of this course, you will have a full understanding of 
the benefits of this technology, will know  about existing successful 
applications, and will develop the necessary understanding and
knowledge to design and apply fuzzy logic to your particular needs.

Who Should Attend: 

Engineers, technical managers and project leaders, scientists, 
systems analysts, as well as others who would like to have more 
knowledge about this emerging technology.

About the course: 

This is the strongest and most complete course 
available on this topic. All the presenters of this course are 
pioneers of the field, including Professor Lotfi Zadeh, who 
introduced its seminal ideas and concepts.  Even if you have already 
taken a course or  tutorial on fuzzy logic, you should try to attend 
this course since it will provide you with a deeper understanding of 
the latest techniques and applications in the areas of fuzzy logic, 
soft computing, pattern recognition, intelligent control, 
computational neural networks, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems.

Hands-on and Problem Solving Sessions:

Include presentations by commercial tool developers on their available
software and hardware products for fuzzy logic.
