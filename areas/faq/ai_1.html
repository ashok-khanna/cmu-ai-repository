*** Introduction:

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Artificial Intelligence
(AI).  This file/article is an attempt to gather these questions and
their answers into a convenient reference for AI researchers. It is
posted on a monthly basis. The hope is that this will cut down on the
user time and network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the
same questions over and over, as well as providing education by
answering questions some readers may not even have thought to ask.

The latest version of this FAQ is available via anonymous FTP from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/faqs/ai/  [128.2.206.173]
using username "anonymous" and password "name@host" (substitute your
email address) or via AFS in the Andrew File System directory
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/ai/
as the files ai_1.faq, ai_2.faq, ai_3.faq, ai_4.faq, ai_5.faq and ai_6.faq.

Subject: [1-0] What is the purpose of this newsgroup?

The newsgroup comp.ai exists for general discussion of topics related
to Artificial Intelligence. For example, possible topics can
include (but are not necessarily limited to):
   announcements of AI books and products
   discussion of AI programs and tools
   questions about AI techniques
   problems implementing an AI technique
Postings should be of general interest to the AI community. See also
part 2 of the FAQ for a list of other more specialized discussion lists.

Every so often, somebody posts an inflammatory message, such as
   Will computers every really think?
   AI hasn't done anything worthwhile.
These "religious" issues serve no real purpose other than to waste
bandwidth. If you feel the urge to respond to such a post, please do
so through a private e-mail message, or post redirecting follow-ups to
comp.ai.philosophy.  

We've tried to minimize the overlap with the FAQ postings to the
comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.prolog, comp.ai.neural-nets, and
comp.ai.shells newsgroups, so if you don't find what you're looking
for here, we suggest you try the FAQs for those newsgroups. These FAQs
should be available by anonymous ftp in subdirectories of
   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/
or by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with subject "help".

The Lisp FAQ is also available by anonymous ftp from the same ftp
location as the AI FAQ and from ftp.think.com:/public/think/lisp/.
The Expert Systems Shells FAQ is also available by anonymous ftp from
the same ftp location as the AI FAQ. 

Information about Prolog may be obtained from two sources: The Prolog
FAQ, which is posted twice a month to the newsgroup comp.lang.prolog
by Jamie Andrews <jamie@cs.sfu.ca>, and the Prolog Resource Guide,
which is posted to the newsgroup comp.lang.prolog once a month, and is
available by anonymous FTP from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/faqs/prolog/ [128.2.206.173] 
or in the AFS directory 
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/prolog/
as the files prg_1.faq and prg_2.faq.

The Robotics FAQ is available by anonymous ftp from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/nivek/robotics-faq/ [128.2.206.173]
as the files part1 and part2. To obtain a copy by email, send a message to 
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu containing the following lines:
   send usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/part1
   send usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/part2
On UUCP, it is available at 
   uunet!/archive/usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/ 
as the files part1.Z and part2.Z, or by ftp from 
   ftp.uu.net:/archive/usenet/news.answers/robotics-faq/ [137.39.1.9]

Information about object-oriented programming can be obtained in the
newsgroups comp.object, comp.lang.clos, and comp.lang.smalltalk.
Information about object-oriented databases can be obtained in the
survey compiled by Stewart Clamen, which may be found either in the
comp.object FAQ posting, by anonymous FTP from
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs/user/clamen/OODBMS/evolution-summary.gz
or at the URL
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clamen/OODBMS/evolution-summary.gz

Subject: [1-2] Glossary of AI terms.

This is the start of a simple glossary of short definitions for AI terminology.

   ai:
        A three-toed sloth of genus Bradypus. This forest-dwelling
        animal eats the leaves of the trumpet-tree and sounds a
        high-pitched squeal when disturbed. (Based on the Random House
        dictionary definition.)

   Admissibility:
        An admissible search algorithm is one that is guaranteed to
        find an optimal path from the start node to a goal node, if
        one exists. In A* search, an admissible heuristic is one that never
        overestimates the distance remaining from the current node to
        the goal. 

   Case-based Reasoning: 
        Technique whereby "cases" similar to the current problem are
        retrieved and their "solutions" modified to work on the current
        problem. 

   Data Mining:
	Also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) was been defined
	as "The nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and
	potentially useful information from data" in Frawley and
	Piatetsky-Shapiro's overview.  It uses machine learning, statistical
	and visualization techniques to discover and present knowledge in a
	form which is easily comprehensible to humans.

   Fuzzy Logic:
        In Fuzzy Logic, truth values are real values in the closed
        interval [0..1]. The definitions of the boolean operators are
        extended to fit this continuous domain. By avoiding discrete
        truth-values, Fuzzy Logic avoids some of the problems inherent in
        either-or judgments and yields natural interpretations of utterances
        like "very hot". Fuzzy Logic has applications in control theory.

   Nonlinear Planning:
        A planning paradigm which does not enforce a total (linear)
        ordering on the components of a plan.

   Strong AI:           
        Claim that computers can be made to actually think, just like human
        beings do. More precisely, the claim that there exists a class of
        computer programs, such that any implementation of such a program is
        really thinking.

   Validation:
        The process of confirming that one's model uses measureable inputs
        and produces output that can be used to make decisions about the
        real world.

   Verification:
        The process of confirming that an implemented model works as intended.

   Weak AI:             
        Claim that computers are important tools in the modeling and
        simulation of human activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-3] What are the top schools in AI?

The answer to this question is not intended to be a ranking and should
not be interpreted as such. There are several major problems with
ratings like the Gourman Report and the US News and World Report. Such
rankings are often unsubstantiated and anecdotal, their accuracy is
questionable, and they do not focus on the subfields of an area. When
selecting a graduate school, students should look for schools which
not only have excellent programs in their general area of research
but also at least one faculty member whose research interests mesh
well with the student's. Accordingly, we've broken down this list
according to topic, and sorted the schools within each topic in
ALPHABETICAL ORDER. 

For a school to be added to a topic area, there should at least two
faculty actively conducting research in that area and the school
should have a "good" reputation in that area. Exceptions are made for
schools which only have one faculty member in the area, but that
professor is a "leader" of the area, or for fields where the total
number of people working in the area is small in the first place. The
general idea behind these criteria is to ensure that a school has
enough activity in the area that a student who considers one of these
schools won't be disappointed if one of the faculty in that area is on
sabbatical or isn't taking students. Note that the research need not
be conducted in the school's computer science department for the
school to be listed -- in some cases we've included schools where the
research is being conducted in a different department or special laboratory.

The best way for students to discover which schools are good in a
field is to ask professors (and graduate students) in their
undergraduate school for suggestions on where to apply. Reading the
research journals in the field is another good method (see part 3 of
the FAQ).

A genealogy of AI thesis-advising relationships is available by
anonymous ftp as 
   cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/aigen.rpt
Although intended to complement citation analysis and free-text
information retrieval as tools for understanding the AI community and
their connections to other disciplines, it may be useful to
prospective graduate students. For example, it may help you understand
the historical context of a given professor's perspective.  2,600 MS
and PhD theses have been tabulated so far.  If you'd like to
contribute additional listings (including year, title, abstract,
school, advisor, committee members, and subsequent employment), write
to Rik Belew <rik@cs.ucsd.edu> or fax 619-534-7029, for the
questionnaire. A copy of the questionaire and more information is
available in 
   cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/announce.t

A list of email addresses for CS departments is posted once a month to
the newsgroup soc.college.gradinfo.

The Association for Computational Linguistics publishes a directory of
graduate programs in Computational Linguistics ($15 for members, $30
for others). It includes several useful indices (e.g., index of
faculty and a list of references). Contact Association for
Computational Linguistics, Walker, C. N. 925, Bernardsville, NJ
07924-0925, phone/fax 908-204-1337, or send email to acl@bellcore.com.

NOTE THAT THIS LIST IS PRELIMINARY AND BY NO MEANS COMPLETE.

Subject: [1-5] What are the rules for the game of "Life"?

Cellular Automata, of which Life is an example, were suggested by
Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, and first formalized by von Neumann.
Conway's "Game of Life" was popularized in Martin Gardner's
mathematical games column in the October 1970 and February 1971 issues
of Scientific American.  (Shorter notes on life are alse given in the
column in each month from October 1970 to April 1971, and well as
November 1971, January 1972, and December 1972.) There's also quite a
bit on the game in "The Recursive Universe", by William Poundstone,
Oxford University Press, 1987, 252 pages.
 
The rules for the game of life are quite simple. The game board is a
rectangular cell array, with each cell either empty or filled. At each
tick of the clock, we generate the next generation by the following rules:

        if a cell is empty, fill it if 3 of its neighbors are filled
        (otherwise leave it empty)

        if a cell is filled, it
                dies of loneliness if it has 1 or fewer neighbors
                continues to live if it has 2 or 3 neighbors
                dies of overcrowding if it has more than 3 neighbors

Neighbors include the cells on the diagonals. Some implementations use
a torus-based array (edges joined top-to-bottom and left-to-right) for
computing neighbors. 

For example, a row of 3 filled cells will become a column of 3 filled
cells in the next generation. The R pentomino is an interesting
pattern: 
      xx
     xx
      x
Try it with other patterns of 5 cells initially occupied. If you
record the ages of cells, and map the ages to colors, you can get a
variety of beautiful images.

When implementing Life, be sure to maintain separate arrays for the
old and new generation. Updating the array in place will not work
correctly. Another optimization to to maintain a list of the cells
that changed.

Conway has demonstrated that it is possible to construct the basic
building blocks of a computer from Life using modified glider guns.

   Ways", Academic Press, New York, 1982, ISBN 0-120911-507.

Subject: [1-6] What AI competitions exist?

The Loebner Prize, based on a fund of over $100,000 established by New
York businessman Hugh G. Loebner, is awarded annually for the computer
program that best emulates natural human behavior. During the
contest, a panel of independent judges attempts to determine whether
the responses on a computer terminal are being produced by a computer
or a person, along the lines of the Turing Test. The designers of the
best program each year win a cash award and a medal. If a program
passes the test in all its particulars, then the entire fund will be
paid to the program's designer and the fund abolished. For further
information about the Loebner Prize, see the URL

Stiquito is a small (3cm H x 7cm W x 6cm L), simple (32 parts) and
inexpensive (< $30) nitinol-propelled hexapod robot developed at the
Indiana University (Bloomington) Robotics Laboratory.  Its legs are
propelled by nitnol actuator wires. Each leg has one degree of freedom.
The robot walks up to 10 centimeters per minute and can carry a 9-volt
cell, a MOSIS "tiny chip" and power transistors to drive the nitinol
actuator wires. Nitinol wire (aka BioMetal, Flexinol), is a nickel-titanium
alloy which exerts useful force as it is heated by passing a current
through it. IUCS Technical Report 363a describes Stiquito's construction
and is available by anonymous ftp from

Subject: [1-9] Future Directions of AI

The purpose of this question is to compile a list of major ongoing and
future thrusts of AI. To be included in this list a research problem
or application must have the following characteristics:

   [1]  Collaborative Community Effort: It must span several subfields
        of AI, requiring some degree of collaboration between AI
        researchers of different specialties. The idea is to help
        unify the fragmented subfields with a common purpose or
        purposes. 

   [2]  High Impact: It must address important problems of widespread interest.
        Solving the problem must matter to many people and not simply
        be adding another grain of sand on the anthill. This will help
        motivate and excite researchers, and justify the field to outsiders.

   [3]  Short Horizon for Progress: It must be possible to have incremental
        progress and not be an all or nothing problem. For example,
        problems where we can reasonably expect to make significant
        measurable progress over the next 10 years or so.

   [4]  Drive Basic Research: It should involve more than just
        applying current technology, but should drive basic research
        and the development of new technology (possibly in completely
        new directions). 

In short, these problems should be "Grand Challenges" for AI. If you
were trying to describe the field of AI to a layman, what concrete
problems would you use to illustrate the overall vision of the field?
Saying that the goal of AI is to produce "thinking machines that solve
problems" doesn't quite cut it.

   o  Knowbots/Infobots and Intelligent Help Desks
         Unifies NLU, NLG, Information Retrieval, KR, Reasoning,
         Intelligent User Interfaces, Qualitative Reasoning.

   o  Autonomous Vehicles
         Unifies Robotics, Machine Vision, Machine Learning,
         Intelligent Control, Planning

   o  Machine Translation
         Unifies NLU, NLG, Knowledge Representation, Speech Understanding,
         Speech Synthesis 

Additional problems are, of course, welcome. I have not included the
Loebner Prize (e.g., passing the unrestricted Turing Test) in the list
because it doesn't address a high impact problem.

It seems appropriate to mention, in this context, some of the early
goals of AI.  In 1958 Newell and Simon predicted that computers would
-- by 1970 -- be capable of composing classical music, discovering
important new mathematical theorems, playing chess at grandmaster
level, and understanding and translating spoken language. Although
these predictions were overly optimistic, they did represent a set of
focused goals for the field of AI. [See H. A. Simon and A. Newell,
"Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations Research",
Operation Research, pages 1-10, January-February 1958.]
