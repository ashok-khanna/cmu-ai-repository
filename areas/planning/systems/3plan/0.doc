Summary:      SNLP, TOCL, and TOPI planners

Version:      23-FEB-93

Description: 

   This directory contains contains 3 comparable planners -- SNLP, TOCL,
   and TOPI -- along with domain and testing information.  SNLP is a
   domain independent systematic conjunctive nonlinear (partial-order)
   planner that is both complete and sound, TOCL is a total ordered
   version of SNLP, and TOPI is a backward chaining planner.

   The planners were created for comparing linear and nonlinear
   planning in the Barrett and Weld paper.
