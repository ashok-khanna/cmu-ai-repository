Package:      areas/planning/systems/buridan/

Name:         BURIDAN

Summary:      Extension of SNLP that models probabilistic conditional outcomes.

Version:      22-OCT-93

Description: 

   This directory contains BURIDAN, an extension of SNLP which breaks
   free from the tortuous chains of STRIPS-style operators by modeling
   probabilistic, conditional outcomes.  Whereas classical planners'
   primitive is of the form "Generate a plan that provably achieves goal
   G", BURIDAN responds to requests of the form "Generate a plan that,
   with probability at least tau, will achieve goal G".

   It also includes the VCR graphical plan browser, which requires CLIM.

Requires:     Common Lisp, CLIM
