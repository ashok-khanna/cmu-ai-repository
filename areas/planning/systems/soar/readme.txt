                         THE SOAR PROJECT README FILE
                         ----------------------------

Last updated 3-May-94 by Allan Rempel (rempel@cs.cmu.edu).

Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Michigan, and the Information
Sciences Institute of the University of Southern California announce 
that the Soar system (versions 5.2.2 and later) has been placed in the
public domain.

The system may be retrieved by anonymous FTP at centro.soar.cs.cmu.edu
[128.2.242.245].  Simply establish an ftp connection to centro.  On unix
machines, this is often done with "ftp centro.soar.cs.cmu.edu".  If your
domain name resolver doesn't recognize centro, type "ftp 128.2.242.245".
At the username prompt, type "anonymous".  At the password prompt, enter
your email address.

Once you're in, the current directory will be set to /usr0/tmp by default.
There is nothing of interest in that directory, so you'll need to cd
(change directory) to /afs/cs/project/soar/public where the Soar files
are kept.  Note that you'll have to type in the whole directory path
in one command, ie. "cd /afs/cs/project/soar/public".  This is because
some of the directories between "/" and "/afs/cs/project/soar/public"
are protected from anonymous ftp, so you won't be able to cd to them,
but you can cd over them to "/afs/cs/project/soar/public".

This README file is available as /afs/cs/project/soar/public/README.

There is also a README file in /afs/cs/project/soar/public/Soar6/README,
which contains more information about the files in the ftp directory.
Those who wish to download a copy of Soar for themselves are urged to
get that README file first.


For more information:

Information about the system is obtainable by sending email to
soar-requests@cs.cmu.edu or by writing to The Soar Group, School of
Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.

The Soar group maintains several mailing lists which serve as forums
for the discussion of various issues.  Soar-group is the most
commonly used list, and it sees discussions of the architecture,
proposed changes to the architecture, the research that people in the
Soar community are doing, and various questions and answers on how to
do certain things in Soar.  If you would like to be on the soar-group
mailing list, send mail to soar-requests@cs.cmu.edu asking to be
put on it.

Finally, though the software is in the public domain, the manual
remains under copyright. To obtain one (at no charge) send a request
(including your physical mail address) to soar-doc@cs.cmu.edu or
to the physical address above.
