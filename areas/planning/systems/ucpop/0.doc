Name:         UCPOP

Summary:      Partial Order Planner

Version:      2.0 (5-OCT-93); 1.00a (10-NOV-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains UCPOP, a domain independent partial order
   planner that handles an expressive action representation (conditional
   effects, universally quantified effects, and universally quantified
   preconditions and goals.  UCPOP is both complete and sound.

   UCPOP operates with actions that have conditional effects, universally
   quantified preconditions and effects, and accepts universally
   quantified goals, in addition to disjunction, negation, and
   existential quantification.  With a conservative search strategy
   UCPOP is both sound and complete for this representation. 

   The Common Lisp implementation is quite efficient requiring between
   5-50ms to explore and refine a partial plan. In particular, UCPOP is
   as fast as or faster than SNLP in comparable domains. (UCPOP is upward
   compatible with SNLP.) Instructors interested in using UCPOP in a
   classroom setting will be happy to note that the UCPOP code is
   exceptionally clean and only slightly larger than SNLP. It also has a
   CLIM-based graphical plan-space browser, a user's manual, and a
   large set of domain theories and search functions for testing.
