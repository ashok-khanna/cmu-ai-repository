Description: 

   This directory contains SPA (Systematic Plan Adaptor), a Lisp
   case-based planning system.

   SPA is a domain-independent algorithm for case-based plan adaptation that
   is sound, complete, and systematic.  Since SPA is sound, every plan it
   returns is guaranteed to achieve the goal. Since the algorithm is complete,
   it is guaranteed to find a plan if one exists, regardless of the initial
   plan returned from the library.  Systematicity guarantees that SPA explores
   the space of partially specified, incomplete plans avoiding redundant or
   wasted effort.  The algorithm provides an excellent vehicle for further
   study, particularly on issues involving the role of heuristic and
   problem-specific knowledge in the planning process.
