Summary:      Spoken vowels in context.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a database of vowels spoken in between a h
   and a d (hence the name "hVd"). The speakers 'andy' and 'geoff'
   were recorded directly on to the computer by Andy Hewett during 1987.
   The other speakers were recorded in a quiet (but not anechoic) office
   using a Sony PCM video tape machine by David Deterding during 1987.
   It includes male and female speakers.  The speech is sampled using a
   12 bit ADC at 10kHz.
