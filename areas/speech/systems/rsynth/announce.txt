I have been trying to pull together the various parts of a 
text to speech system from various public domain sources.

A pre-release which works on Sun SPARC stations (which is all
I have access to can be found on the comp.speech archive site i.e.

svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk

In /pub/comp.speech/sources/rsynth-0.9.tar.Z

This several steps beyond the "speak" program which concatenates .au files,
but is not yet "finished".  The bottom level is based on the "klatt-0.02"
code posted here some time back (heavily modified).

However I have not got much (any?) time to work on this at present,
so I am posting it in the hope that it may help some people as-is.

I would appreciate feedback as to how it compares 
(strengths/weaknesses) with other systems, and any "expert" advice on
how to improve it, as and when I get time.

(It is a private project and only connection with TI is that I work
 for them - but not on this.)

I have made another release of my "rsynth" package.
There are no major functional changes, but I have included 
drivers for linux, NeXT and SGI machines that have been contributed by
a number of people.

Thanks to:

   Rob Hooft.        hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE       - Linux
   Axel Belinfante   Axel.Belinfante@cs.utwente.nl  - mods for WWW integration
   Ben Stuyts        benstn@olivetti.nl             - NeXT
   Frans Van Hoesel  hoesel@chem.rug.nl             - SGI 

   Various other people who have sent me mail with suggestions.
   (If your favourite suggestion/enhancement has not made it please re-mail me
    I have lost one or two!)

Only other change of note is that the infinite recusion problem
when "spelling out" words WITHOUT the dictionary is fixed.

rsynth is available via anonymous ftp from :  svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk

 /comp.speech/sources/rsynth-1.0.tar.Z
or
 /comp.speech/sources/rsynth-1.0.tar.gz
