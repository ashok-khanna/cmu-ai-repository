<H2>CELP: FS-1016 Code Excited Linear Prediction coder</H2>

CELP is a lossy compression algorithm used for low bit rate (e.g.,
4800 bps in U.S. Fed-Std-1016) speech coding. CELP stands for "code
excited linear prediction". CELP coding, at 4800 bps, breaks the
performance barrier of most Government standards, providing Consortium
ratings of "very good" intelligibility and "excellent" quality,
comparable to 32,000 bps CVSD.

Like all vector quantization techniques, CELP coding is a
frame-oriented technique that breaks a sampled input signal into
blocks of samples (i.e., vectors) that are processed as one unit.
CELP coding is based on analysis-by-synthesis search procedures,
perceptually weighted vector quantization (VQ), and linear prediction
(LP).  A 10th order LP filter is used to model the speech signal's
short-term spectrum, or formant structure.  Long-term signal
periodicity, or pitch, is modeled by an adaptive code book VQ.  The
residual from the short-term LP and pitch VQ is vector quantized using
a fixed stochastic code book.  The optimal scaled excitation vectors
from the adaptive and stochastic code books are selected by minimizing
a time varying, perceptually weighted distortion measure that improves
subjective speech quality by exploiting masking properties of human
hearing.

The CELP coder's computational requirements are dominated by the two
code book searches.  The computational complexity and speech quality
of the coder depend upon the search sizes of the code books.  Any
subset of either code book can be searched to fit processor
constraints, at the expense of speech quality.

Fed-Std-1016 uses an 8 kHz sample rate and a 30 ms frame size with
four 7.5 ms subframes.  CELP analysis consists of three basic
functions: 1) short-term linear prediction, 2) long-term adaptive code
book search, and 3) innovation stochastic code book search.  CELP
synthesis consists of the corresponding three synthesis functions
performed in reverse order with the optional addition of a fourth
function, called a postfilter, to enhance the output speech.  The
transmitted CELP parameters are the stochastic code book index and
gain, the adaptive code book index and gain, and 10 line spectral
parameters (LSP).

This directory contains the U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based
4800 bps code excited linear prediction voice coder version 3.2
(CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation source codes. Example input and
processed speech files are included.
