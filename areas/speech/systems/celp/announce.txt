CELP 3.2a Release

Dear CELPers,

We have placed an updated version of the FS-1016 CELP 3.2 code in the
anonymous FTP area on super.org (192.31.192.1).  It's in:

  /pub/celp_3.2a.tar.Z (please be sure to do the ftp in binary mode).

This is essentially the PC release that was on fumar, except that we
started directly from the PC disks.  The value added is that we have
made over 69 corrections and fixes.  Most of these were necessary
because of the 8 character file name limit on DOS, but there are some
others, as well.

The code (C, FORTRAN, diskio) all has been built and tested on a Sun4
under SunOS4.1.3.  If you want to run it somewhere else, then you may
have to do a bit of work.  (A Solaris 2.x-compatible release is
planned soon.)

[One note to PCers.  The files:
[
[       cbsearch.F celp.F csub.F mexcite.F psearch.F
[
[are meant to be passed through the C preprocessor (cpp).
[We gather that DOS (or whatever it's called) can't distinguish 
[the .F from a .f.  Be careful!

Very limited support is available from the authors (Joe, et al.).
Please do not send questions or suggestions without first reading the
documentation (README files, the Technical Information Bulletin, etc.).
The authors would enjoy hearing from you, but they have limited time
for support and would like to use it as efficiently as possible.  They
welcome bug reports, but, again, please read the documentation first.
All users of FS-1016 CELP software are strongly encouraged to acquire
the latest release (version 3.2a as of this writing).

We do not know how long we will be able to leave the software on this
site, but it should be _at_least_ through 1 October 1993 (if you find
it missing, please drop me (Craig) a note).  Please try to get the
software during off hours (8 p.m. - 7 a.m. Eastern Standard time) or
folks here might complain and we'll have to get rid of the code (if
that happens, we'll try to pass it on to someone else, who can put it
on the net).  We would be more than happy for someone to copy it and
make it available elsewhere.

Good Luck,

P.S.  Just so you all know, I (Craig) am not actually involved in
CELP work.  I mainly got with Joe to help make the software available
on the Internet.  In the course of doing so, I cleaned up much of it,
but I am not, by any stretch, a CELP expert and will most likely
be unable to answer any technical questions concerning it. ;^)

The U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
prediction voice coder version 3.2 (CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation
source codes are available for worldwide distribution (on DOS
diskettes, but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations) from NTIS
and DTIC.  Example input and processed speech files are included.  A
Technical Information Bulletin (TIB), "Details to Assist in
Implementation of Federal Standard 1016 CELP," and the official
standard, "Federal Standard 1016, Telecommunications:  Analog to
Digital Conversion of Radio Voice by 4,800 bit/second Code Excited
Linear Prediction (CELP)," are also available.

This is available through the National Technical Information Service:

The "AD" ordering number for the CELP software is AD M000 118
(US$ 90.00) and for the TIB it's AD A256 629 (US$ 17.50).  The LPC-10
standard, described below, is FIPS Pub 137 (US$ 12.50).  There is a
$3.00 shipping charge on all U.S. orders.  The telephone number for
their automated system is 703-487-4650, or 703-487-4600 if you'd prefer
to talk with a real person.

The U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1015/NATO-STANAG-4198 based 2400 bps
linear prediction coder (LPC-10) was republished as a Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication 137 (FIPS Pub 137).
It is described in:

Thomas E. Tremain, "The Government Standard Linear Predictive Coding
Algorithm:  LPC-10," Speech Technology Magazine, April 1982, p. 40-49.

There is also a section about FS-1015 in the book:
Panos E. Papamichalis, Practical Approaches to Speech Coding,
Prentice-Hall, 1987.

The voicing classifier used in the enhanced LPC-10 (LPC-10e) is described in:

of Speech with Applications to the U.S. Government LPC-10E Algorithm,"
Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and
Signal Processing, 1986, p. 473-6.

Copies of the official standard
"Federal Standard 1016, Telecommunications: Analog to Digital Conversion

That's difficult.  In the next release, we'll have something
readable on a Sun, e.g., PostScript.  Until then, please
find a Macintosh that can import Microsoft Word and Canvas
documents.  As you presume, the file needs to be unbinhex'ed.
The result will be a self-extracting archive (Mac executable)
that can be double clicked to uncompress the Word and Canvas
documents.  Unfortunately, Figures 12, 13, and 15 are missing
from this release, but will be scanned and included in the next
release.

I recommend that you acquire the NCS's official hardcopy
version of the TIB (which is complete):

Technical Information Bulletin (TIB), "Details to Assist in
Implementation of Federal Standard 1016 CELP," and the official
standard, "Federal Standard 1016, Telecommunications:  Analog to
Digital Conversion of Radio Voice by 4,800 bit/second Code Excited
Linear Prediction (CELP)"

This is available through the National Technical Information Service:

NTIS
U.S. Department of Commerce
5285 Port Royal Road
Springfield, VA  22161
USA
(703) 487-4650

The "AD" ordering number for the CELP software is AD M000 118
(US$ 90.00) and for the TIB it's AD A256 629 (US$ 17.50).  The LPC-10
