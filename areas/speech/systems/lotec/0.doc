Name:         LOTEC

Summary:      Simple Speech Recognition System

Version:      23-MAY-94

Description: 

   The Lotec Speech Recognition Package is all you need to build a
   single-speaker, small-vocabulary, low-quality continuous speech
   recognition module, for use as part of a larger system. Input is sound
   samples in the Sun .au file format, plus word templates in the same
   format, and output is a bunch of word hypotheses, each consisting of
   temporal location and likelihood score (e.g., `template 2 for the word
   "central" matched the input best in the time span from 450 to 830
   milliseconds, and the match discrepancy was 405.32). (That is, it
   outputs a lattice of word hypotheses.)

Requires:     SUN Sparc (SunOS 4.1.2), multimedia library files in
              /usr/demo/SOUND, X WIndows, gcc, microphone
