Package:      areas/speech/systems/afsp/

Name:         AFsp

Summary:      Audio File I/O Routines

Version:      V1R2 (24-FEB-94)

Description: 

   The AFsp package is a library of routines for reading and writing
   audio files.  The emphasis is on providing support for the type of
   audio file used by the speech processing research community.  The
   routines have been designed to be easy to use, yet provide transparent
   support the reading of several audio file formats.  A secondary
   purpose for distributing these routines is to encourage the use of a
   standard audio file format for the header information in the output
   files.

   The following file formats are supported for reading.
   -  NIST SPHERE audio files
   -  Sun/NeXT audio files
   -  DEC audio files
   -  IRCAM SoundFiles
   -  INRS-Telecom audio files
   -  ESPS sampled data feature files
   -  Headerless audio files

   The audio file open routine automatically senses the file type and
   communicates it to the audio file reading routines. Formats are
   converted on the fly as the file is read, so the user manipulates
   floats and doesn't need to worry about the underlying data format.

   For writing, the routines produce a standard format file, though
   options are available to produce headerless files if desired.  This
   standard format is a compatible with the Sun audio file format.  There
   is provision for storing extra information in the extensible part of
   the header.

   Several audio file utilities (for copying, comparing, and filtering
   audio files) are included in the package.
