This directory tree contains sources for the Network Audio System, a
network-transparent, client/server audio system, including:

    o   sample server implementations

	- Sun Sparc 1 AM79C30A Digital Subscriber Controller and
	      Sparc 10 Dual Basic Rate ISDN Interface
	  (SunOS 4.1.[23], Solaris 2.x)

	- SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.x)

	- VOXware (FreeBSD, Linux, SVR4.[02])

    o	an application programming interface library
    o	a variety of sample applications

The client software can also be used with several models of NCD X
terminals.

Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio file and data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

Please note that the Network Audio System has no relationship to the NetAudio 
products from Townshend Computer Tools.

We've set up a mailing list for folks who are working with the Network
Audio System:

    nas@ncd.com			General discussion of the Network
				Audio System; anyone who who will
				actively participate is welcome to
				join.

    nas-request@ncd.com		Where to send requests to get on or off the
				mailing list.


We hope you enjoy the Network Audio System.  There're still a few
pieces to be added, but already a significant number of hardware and
software vendors are finding that it solves their problems.  Besides,
you can't beat the price!  :-)
