                      FREE EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE PACKAGE

                             P. C. CONVOLUTION

P.C. convolution is a educational software package that graphically 
demonstrates the convolution operation.  It runs on IBM PC type computers 
using DOS 4.0 or later.  It is currently being used in schools of Mathematics, 
Electrical Engineering, Earth Sciences, Aeronautics, Astronomy, Geophysics, 
and (believe it or not) Experimental Psychology.  The software currently
only shows continuous time convolution, but a discrete time version is
under development.

Anyone may download a demonstration version of this software via anonymous 
ftp from 131.151.4.11 (file name /pub/pc_conv.zip)

University instructors my obtain a free, fully operational version by 
contacting Dr. Kurt Kosbar at the address listed below.
