ANNOUNCING THE RELEASE OF THE OGI SPEECH TOOLS (Version 1.0)
=============================================================


A. What are the OGI Speech Tools
================================
The OGI Speech Tools are set of speech data manipulation tools
developed at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at
the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (Portland
Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and display signal
representations, label speech at different levels (e.g., phonetic,
phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers, and display the
output of classification or recognition algorithms time-aligned with
the speech.

A Software Capitalization grant from NSF has allowed to enhance,
document and distribute the tools. Continued maintenance and
improvement of the tools is supported by CSLU.

These include

1. An X windows display tool (LYRE) for displaying data in a time
   synchronous fashion. These mainly constitute the following data
   representations:
   
     a. the speech signal
     b. the spectrogram
     c. the phoneme labels
 
   The data displayed may, however, also include any other type of
   time synchronous information, provided the data is stored in the
   required format.

2. A Neural Network (NOPT) training package, which uses Conjugate
   Gradient descent optimization.

3. An extensive set of C library routines (LIBNSPEECH) for the
   manipulation of speech data. These also include the following signal
   processing routines.

    a. PLP Analysis
    b. Rasta PLP Analysis
    c. Linear Predictive Coding
    d. Mel Cepstrum Coding
    e. Fast Fourier Transform

4. An extensive set of utilities for converting from files
   of different format. These include routines such as:

   a. Converting from ADC to NIST type headers
   b. Converting to mu-law encoded files
   c. Converting from mu-law encoded files back to NIST headered files
   d. Filtering the speech waveform.
   e. Converting to from binary to an ascii data stream.

5. A database utility (find_phone) to efficiently automate speech data
   related queries.  This utility creates a database based on a listing
   of speech files and there corresponding location and label files
   (lola).  It allows the user to specify a particular label or set of
   labels in a given context, display all occurrences of the label, and
   relabel the occurrences if desired.

6. A Vector-Quantizer based on the Linde Buzo and Gray (LBG) algorithm.

7. An set of PEARL Scripts which have been used mainly to automate
   the use of the OGI Speech Tools. 

8. MAN Pages for all routines and programs developed, as well as
   a user manual in both in postscript and {\bf tex} format.


B. How do I get the OGI Speech Tools
====================================

The OGI speech tools are available via anonymous ftp from 

speech.cse.ogi.edu

and are located in 
/pub/tools

Step by Step instructions 
========================= 
First you need to create a directory (on your home machine for
example) , where the speech tools are going to be located. Assume it
is named --> speechtools

% mkdir speechtools [enter]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% cd speechtools [enter]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% mkdir src [enter]
  ~~~~~~~~~~
% cd src [enter]
  ~~~~~~

% ftp speech.cse.ogi.edu [enter]
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connected to lydia.cse.ogi.edu
220  lydia FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.

% Name: (speech.cse.ogi.edu:loginname) anonymous [enter]
                                       ~~~~~~~~~
331 Guest login ok, send ident password.
Password: (your email address) [enter]
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
ftp> cd pub/tools [enter]
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
250 CWD command successful.

ftp> ls [enter]
     ~~

The following files should be listed

  INSTALL
  CHANGES
  ogitools.v1.0.tar.Z
  sun4.binaries.tar.Z
  sun4.libraries.tar.Z
  decmips.binaries.tar.Z
  decmips.libraries.tar.Z
  alpha.binaries.tar.Z
  alpha.libraries.tar.Z

ftp> bin [enter]
    ~~~~~
200 Type set to I.

ftp> prompt [enter]
    ~~~~~~~
Interactive mode off.

ftp> get ogitools.v1.0.tar.Z [enter]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ftp> quit

You now have the speech tools. The INSTALL file contains instructions
for installing the speechtools. The CHANGES file contains a list of
all changes made since the BETA release of the OGI Speech Tools.

To get started quickly, ftp the related binaries files for your
system.

The OGI Speech Tools were written using ANSI style C. If you current
compiler does not support ANSI C style, try getting hold of the GNU C
(gcc) compiler. The configuration file can be changed to use the GCC
compiler by changing the .conf files in the ~/speechtools/src/conf/
directory. There the variable CC='acc' for sun4, must be changed to
CC='gcc'.



C. WHAT NEXT
============

We at CSLU (OGI) would like to compile a mailing list of all speech
tools users, so that we can inform our users community of any
additions and changes to the speech tools.

We would therefore like you, to drop your email address by simply
mailing a message to

tools@cse.ogi.edu

This email address might also be used for requesting more information
on installing the speech tools and for reporting any bugs detected.
This would greatly be appreciated, since we are aiming to keep the
speech tools both portable and robust. Any further suggestions and
additions which you could add will also be appreciated.
