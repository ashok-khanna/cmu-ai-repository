The package recnet-1.0.tar is now available from the "anonymous" ftp site
svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk in directory misc.

recnet is a complete speech recognition system for the DARPA TIMIT and
Resource Management tasks.  It uses recurrent networks to estimate phone
probabilities and Markov models to find the most probable sequence of phones
or words.

The system is a snapshot of evolving research code.  There is no
documentation other than published research papers.  It is configured for
the two specific databases and is unlikely to be of use as a complete system
for other tasks.  This is my own research code and unfortunately I have
little time to support its use by others (unless paid for in terms of joint
publications of course).

The components are:

	A preprocessor which implements many standard and many non-standard
	front end processing

	A recurrent net recogniser and parameter files

	Two Markov model based recognisers, one for phone recognition and one
	for word recognition

	A dynamic programming scoring package

The complete system performs competatively.  I believe the TIMIT phone
recognition rates are the best reported (30.7% errors for 61 symbols).  The
RM system is better than any other monophone based recogniser (about 5%
error on Feb89, Oct89 and Sep92 test sets), although not yet as good as the
best triphone based systems (3-4% error on same test sets).  Publications
giving details of these results can be found on svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk in
directory reports (consult the ABSTRACT file first).

I hope this will be of use to a wide audience, for example:

	Researchers who are familiar with TIMIT and RM and who want to
	compare their systems to another

	Researchers who need specific chunks of code (e.g. LPC or DP scoring)
	and who are prepared to hack it out

	Researchers who want some intermediate results such as phone
	confusions or an initial phone alignment for Resource Management

	Researchers who want to construct a similar system of their own

To make life a little easier, I've set up a Makefile so that "make TIMIT" or
"make RM" does everything (tested on SunOS and IRIX).  You will need the
relevant CDROMs, 150MByte of free space for TIMIT and 300MByte for RM.  The
file recnet-1.0.tar totals 2Mbyte in size including 7,000 lines of
uncommented C source, so you have to be pretty serious to make use of this
offer.  If you do use the code, I'd appreciate an email note so that I can
keep you informed of new releases.
