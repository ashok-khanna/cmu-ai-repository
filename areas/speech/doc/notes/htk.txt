                            HTK Version 1.4
                            ===============

HTK  is  a  software  toolkit for building and manipulating continuous
density Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).  It consists of a set of 12 basic
tools  plus  7 additional more specialised tools.  All tools interface
with  the  outside  world  via a comprehensive set of library modules.
This  HTK  Library  ensures that all tools behave in a uniform way and
simplifies  the development of user-written tools.  HTK is distributed
in  source  form  and  will  run  on  any 32bit machine with an ANSI C
compiler.


The  HTK  Toolkit  provides  facilities  for  speech  analysis,  label
editing,    HMM  initialisation  and  training,  testing  and  results
analysis.  There are no limits in HTK.  Any HMM can have any number of
states  and any number of mixtures.  Both full covariance and diagonal
covariance  can  be  used  and  there is full support for working with
continuous  speech  and context dependent models.  A variety of speech
data  formats  are  supported  and  input  can  be split into multiple
independent   data  streams.    Furthermore,  HTK  includes  a  unique
generalised    parameter    tying   mechanism  which  facilitates  the
manipulation of large sets of HMMs.  Standard techniques such as Grand
Variance  and  Tied-Mixtures  are  fully supported within this general
mechanism.


The  library  includes  modules  that  handle  the  OS  interface; HMM
definitions   and  HMM  i/o;  speech  data  file  i/o  (raw  data  and
parameterised  data);  speech  file transcription i/o; speech training
database  manipulation;  signal  processing  routines;  math  support;
grammar support; and a simple interactive graphics interface.


There  are  12 basic tools and 7 more specialised tools in the current
version of HTK (V1.4).  These perform a range of functions including


HCode -  performs  fft  and lpc  based  speech analysis.  The types of
         output  include lpc filter coefficients, reflection coefs, lp
         cepstra, Mel-scale filter-bank and Mel-scale cepstra.

HInit -  initialise a set of HMMs using a segmental k-means procedure.

HRest -  basic  isolated-word  style  Baum-Welch re-estimation for HMM
         parameters (can also be applied to continuous speech).

HERest - the  main  training  tool.   It performes embedded Baum-Welch
         re-estimation  with  forward-backward  pruning.    It  allows
         parallel operation across a network of machines.

HVite -  a  continuous  speech  Viterbi  based  speech recogniser with
         finite-state  grammar  constraints,  beam  search and garbage
         collection.

HResults -  compares  HVite  output  with  transcriptions  to  perform 
         results  analysis.    This  tools  complies  with the US NIST
         scoring system.

HHEd  -  a  general  HMM  editor  that allows HMM cloning and merging,
         parameter  tying  and untying, state clustering, addition and
         deletion of transitions and mixture splitting and repair.

HLEd  -  provides   batch  editing  of  transcription  files  such  as
         deleting,    merging,   folding  and  conversion  to  context
         dependent labels.

HSLab -  a  simple  interactive  label editor.  It allows labels to be
         attached to a spoken utterance and their boundaries set using
         both visual and audio feedback.  (Note: requires X windows)
	 
HSmooth - smooth tied mixture weights using deleted interpolation.
        


HTK  is  presently installed at more than 50 sites world-wide both for
research  and  product development.  Its current uses include isolated
word recognition, phoneme-based continuous speech recognition, speaker
identification,  word spotting and other pattern matching applications
such as face recognition.


The  V1.4  HTK  distribution consists of all source code (about 30,000
lines),  a Reference Manual, a User Manual, a Programmer Manual and an
Installation Guide.  Also included is a suite of demonstration scripts
further illustrating the main ways of using HTK.  It is distributed on
either  MS-DOS or Apple format 3.5 inch floppy disks (for distribution
only  -  HTK  runs  on  any 32 bit machine).  There are 3 disks in the
distribution    containing  1)  sources,  2)  demonstration,  3)  Unix
compressed  tar archive.  The last disk contains all of 1) and 2), and
is included for rapid installation on Unix systems.


The  cost  of  1 copy of the HTK V1.3 distribution plus a site license
for its use is (in pounds sterling)

     950   (commercial/industrial sites)
     450   (academic)
 
VAT is chargeable on all UK orders.

Post  and packing charges are 5 pounds for UK orders and 20 pounds for
overseas.  Existing HTK V1.2 users can deduct their initial payment as
a discount.  Existing V1.3 users may upgrade to V1.4 free of charge.
