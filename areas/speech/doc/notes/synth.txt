Hi,

as promised, I'm summarising the details I was mailed after I made the
following request...

>
>Just a quick question about software based speech synthesis products.
>I'd be very interested to hear from anyone regarding the availability
>of commercial / public domain / shareware software such as the Klatt
>software based speech synthesizer. I hasten to add I'm mainly
>interested in software to perform conversion from parameters to a
>speech signal, rather than complete text to speech systems.
>

The response I got indicated that there is very little Public Domain
or Shareware speech synthesis related software available for FTP.
However, the ones that are available I've listed below...

Text to phoneme program in /pub/linguist/phon.tar.Z 
from ftp.Hawaii.edu based (I think) on the Naval Research Lab's set of
text to phoneme rules.

Text to speech program in /pub/speak.tar.Z
from wilma.cs.brown.edu - based on concatenation of pre-recorded
speech segments - works on Sun Sparc's.

The following are commercial systems that replies pointed out, I have
included contacts where I was given names / addresses...

MacIntalk (Mac) - formant based speech synthesis
Narrator (Amiga) - formant based synthesis
JSRU software - contact Dr. E.Lewis (eric.lewis@uk.ac.bristol)
Klatt Software - contact... Dr. David Williams  at

Sensimetrics Corporation,
64 Sidney Street, 
Cambridge, 
MA  02139.  
Fax: (617) 225-0470; 
Tel: (617) 225-2442.

Other suggestions were...

Bliss by Dr. John Merus (Brown University) Mertus@browncog.bitnet
CSRE by Dr. Terry Nearey (Alberta University) Nearey@nova.ling.ualberta.ca 

I haven't checked out much of the above-mentioned. I have snail-mailed
Sensimetrics a few weeks ago, but no details forthcoming (anyone from
Sensimetrics listening - mail me 'cos you've got a customer !). Apart
from that, I hope this is useful. I'd like to see some more of this
sort of info, perhaps added to the FAQ - could be useful ?


Thanks to the following who mailed replies, apologies if I have
incorrectly credited anyone, or omitted anyone.

Ken Stevens  (stevens@speech.mit.edu)
Henry Rogers (rogers@epas.utoronto.ca)
Gyger Markus (mgyger@itr.ch)
Mark Huckvale (uclytmh@ucl.ac.uk)
Joe Campbell (jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil)
Marty (marty@cs.utexas.edu)
Terry Baxter (terry@stonyplain.cs.ualberta.ca)


Cheers !

Thanks to those who mailed me regarding phon.tar.Z (text to phoneme
software) which I said could be found in Hawaii - I was wrong - the
particular site I mentioned is no longer operational. Anyway, archie tells
me that there is a copy of the relevant s/w at...

shark.cse.fau.edu in /pub/src/phon.tar.Z

Fingers crossed this will work :)

Have fun !
     
            Jon

I have made another release of my "rsynth" package.
There are no major functional changes, but I have included 
drivers for linux, NeXT and SGI machines that have been contributed by
a number of people.

Thanks to:

   Rob Hooft.        hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE       - Linux
   Axel Belinfante   Axel.Belinfante@cs.utwente.nl  - mods for WWW integration
   Ben Stuyts        benstn@olivetti.nl             - NeXT
   Frans Van Hoesel  hoesel@chem.rug.nl             - SGI 

   Various other people who have sent me mail with suggestions.
   (If your favourite suggestion/enhancement has not made it please re-mail me
    I have lost one or two!)

Only other change of note is that the infinite recusion problem
when "spelling out" words WITHOUT the dictionary is fixed.

rsynth is available via anonymous ftp from :  svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk

 /comp.speech/sources/rsynth-1.0.tar.Z
or
 /comp.speech/sources/rsynth-1.0.tar.gz
