ARMONK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1991 MAY 24 (NB) -- IBM VoiceType,
actually a product of Dragon Systems which is also sold by
that pioneering voice recognition company, provides a
7,000-word speech recognition vocabulary for computer users
who either can't or prefer not to use standard keyboard data
and command entry methods.

Specifically targeted at the needs of the disabled, the
$3,185 speech recognition board is Dragon System's first
Micro Channel-compatible voice recognition system and is
based on Dragon Dictate, the complete dictation system
offered by that New England company.

In addition to the 7,000-word active vocabulary, which can
include up to 2,000 user-defined sounds as words, the
system also includes voice macros which can create
sentences or longer text/number strings up to 1,000
characters long from a single sound command. IBM
VoiceType also has an 80,000-word spelling
dictionary.

The new board and software require a 32-bit
PS/2-compatible (Micro Channel) system and won't ship
until August.

At just over $3,000, the system comes complete with a video
training tape, standard documentation, and a microphone
headset.

For further information or to order IBM VoiceType, call
Dragon Systems at 1-800-TALKTYP (825-5897).
