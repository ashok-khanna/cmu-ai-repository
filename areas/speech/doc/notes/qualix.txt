                       SayIt!

           Voice commands and Macro Builder for
                    Sun Sparcstations

General Description:
-------------------

	SayIt! lets users create time-saving voice-activated
	macros that can include any sequence of keyboard or mouse
	input.

	All macros can be activated via voice commands or keyboard/
	mouse commands. This dramatically increases user productivity
	and makes SayIt two products in one: 

                  Voice command software 
		  Powerful macro builder

Features:
--------
	o  Add voice control to any application
	o  Powerful macro capability - macros can be executed
	   with voice, keyboard, or mouse
	o  Macros can include:
		--mouse commands
		--keystrokes
		--UNIX shell scripts
		--sound
		--clipboard text
		--delays
		--window opening/closing
		--OpenLook drag 'n drop
	o  Macros can function within an application or between
	   applications (see examples below)
	o  Easy to install and train -- all point & click!

Requirements:
------------
	Sun SPARCstation with OS 4.1.1 or greater and OW 3.0
        or greater.

Evaluations:
-----------
	Product evaluations will be available via e-mail
        from Qualix. Contact us at info@qualix.com for
        more information.

Microphones:
------------
	SayIt works with the SunMicrophone (tm) and any other
	microphone that plugs into the Sun audio jack. For
	noisy environments (such as a factory floor), we also
	recommend headset or radio-controlled microphones.
	(A radio-controlled microphone lets the user walk away
	from the workstation, but still execute commands.)

	Contact Qualix for more information on specific microphones.

                  Questions and Answers:
                         SayIt!

         Voice Recognition Macro Building Software
  	       for Sun Workstations

Q.  What is SayIt?

    A.  SayIt is a powerful macro building software package combined
	with speaker dependent voice recognition for Sun workstations.

Q.  How does SayIt learn to recognize my voice?

    A.  You train SayIt to recognize your voice by repeating each
	new command three times. This typically takes only ten seconds
	for each command.

Q.  I have a heavy accent. Will SayIt work for me?

    A.  Yes! SayIt uses speaker dependent voice recognition. This means
	that you train SayIt to recognize the unique characteristics of
	your voice. SayIt will work for any accent AND any language.

Q.  Does SayIt require any internal hardware?

    A.  No. SayIt is completely software-based. The only requirement
        is a microphone to hook up to your SPARC-based computer.

Q.  How can SayIt increase my productivity?


    A.	By building time-saving macros, SayIt lets you access 
        application commands that can take multiple keystrokes
        or mouse clicks, just by saying a single word.


Q.  Can I also access the application macros through the keyboard?

    A.	Yes! With a single keystroke or mouse click you can display 
        a menu of all your macros. Any macro can then be selected 
        for execution with either the mouse or arrow keys. 

Q.  What types of things can I do in an application?

    A.	Since SayIt allows macros to include mouse clicks, 
        mouse drags, keystrokes, and drag and drop, any repetitive 
        sequence you do in any of your applications (or between 
        applications) is possible to put in a macro.

Q.   How long does it take SayIt to respond to a voice command?

    A.	SayIt works in real time. It takes less than a second 
        from the time you finish saying a command until SayIt 
        recognizes the command and starts to execute your macro.

Q.   How many commands can I add to SayIt?

     A.	There is no fixed limit on the number of commands you can 
        add to SayIt. In fact, with SayIt, you can organize your 
        commands in logical groups, so it's easier to remember what
        you've recorded as macros. 

Q.  Will SayIt slow down my machine?

     A.	SayIt is designed so that when you're not talking, your 
        system will not be loaded. The CPU load on a SPARC IPC is 
        less than one percent while SayIt is waiting for you to 
        issue a command. While performing voice recognition, there 
        is a brief period of high CPU use, which drrops as soon 
        as the command has been recognized.


Q.  Will my SunMicrophone work with SayIt?

      A.  Absolutely! In fact, most microphones that plug into 
          the audio adaptor on Sun workstations will work. Check 
          with Qualix for more information on specific microphone models.


Q.  I'd like to use SayIt on a factory floor that's very noisy. 

    A.	No problem. If you're working in a noisy environment, 
        we recommend a headset microphone. This lets you speak 
        into the microphone, but not pick up any background noise. 
        In fact, we have some users who use radio-controlled 
        microphones! This lets them walk away from their workstation, 
        but still automatically execute macros.


Q.  How difficult is SayIt to install? Do I have to be superuser?


   A.	One of the major strengths of SayIt is its ease of use 
        and installation. For one thing, you don't need a root 
        password. If you can receive e-mail and use OpenWindows 3.0, 
        SayIt can be e-mailed to you. When you receive the mail 
        message, just click on the icon! SayIt will ask you a few 
        questions and then automatically install itself.


Q.  What system configuration do I need to use SayIt?

    A.	SayIt runs on a Sun SPARCstation under SunOS 4.1.1 or 
        later with OpenWindows 3.0 or later.


Q.  Can I get an evaluation copy of SayIt?

    A.	Yes. The evaluation copy will let you set up and execute 
        a limited number of application and command macros. Contact 
        Qualix for further details.

Q.  How much does it cost?

    A.	The list price of SayIt is $295. However, for a limited 
        time only, you can purchase SayIt at a special introductory 
        price of $195.

Q.   Sounds great! How do I buy one?

     A.	Call Qualix at 1-800-245-UNIX or send e-mail to info@qualix.com. 
        Our UNIX software specialists will be glad to provide 
        additional information.
