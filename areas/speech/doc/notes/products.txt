Voice Recognition
 
Voice  input  may  be  used  as  a  form of data entry.   Although voice
recognition technology is not advanced enough for  unlimited  vocabulary
and  speech  pattern  variations,  significant  function and products do
exist and are being used.

PRODUCT  DESCRIPTION:    Home Automation Link (HAL-ES) is a multitasking
system controlled by voice.  The complete voice-controlled IntroVoice VI
(500 words) system allows a person to operate  the  computer,  including
word   processing,  spread  sheets,  database  management,  programming,
computer-aided drawing (CAD/CAM, AUTOCAD, VERSACAD) by voice - no mouse.
The ability to bypass or augment keyboard  operation  is  a  significant
capability by voice, used in learning, access, environmental control and
communications.   Two programs operate simultaneously: the environmental
program runs in background memory and the working program in  foreground
memory,  allowing  a  user  to work and control the computer at the same
time.   IntroVoice VI, a speech  recognition  synthesis  card,  converts
spoken  words  into  commands  or  data.    Multiple  key  data entry is
controlled by the  spoken  word,  allowing  the  disabled  to  run  word
processing by "speaking out."

in length and programs a particular character string (1 to 76 characters
long)  for  each  trained utterance the user speaks into the microphone.
The user constructs  separate  vocabularies  for  each  application  and
stores  (maximum 160 words per vocabulary).  Software includes a program
to create and store vocabulary, one to load an applications program  and
its  vocabulary  by  voice  and one with pre-programmed vocabularies for
some popular applications.   IntroVoice III  comes  with  a  microphone,
manual and software and is portable.

PRODUCT  DESCRIPTION:    The IntroVoice V voice input system for the IBM
PC, XT/AT and PS/2 Model 30 may be trained to recognize  certain  spoken
utterances  (up  to  1.25  seconds long); when the user speaks a trained
utterance  into  the  system's  microphone,  the  programmed  string  of
characters  is  sent  to  the  computer  as  if  it  were input from the
keyboard.  Sets of trained utterances may be created;  the  vocabularies
can contain up to 500 utterances.  The number of characters triggered by
each  utterance  depends  on memory; the maximum number of characters is
1,000.   The microphone can be turned  on  and  off  by  voice  command.
Software includes a program to assist the user in creating vocabularies,
as  well  as  one  with  predetermined  vocabularies for certain popular
applications.  The system includes a PC board,  microphone,  manual  and
software;  it  can be hooked up to DECTalk or Speech Plus for output for
the blind to say and hear voice input and output.

and prompting.  Both voice input and output can be  used  with  any  IBM
application  program,  with no modification to existing software.  Voice
recognition and synthesis character strings are easily  defined  by  the
Voice Utility Program (VUP) supplied with the system.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:  The VTR 6050 Series II voice terminal allows voice
to  be  used  as input to any computer accepting RS-232 input.  The user
programs the VTR 6050 unit to associate certain utterances with  strings
of  ASCII characters (up to 30 characters in length).  These strings can
then be sent to the host computer as RS-232 input.  Up to 20 strings can
be stored in a buffer before being transmitted.  Individual vocabularies
of utterances can contain up to  150  words;  the  number  of  potential
vocabularies  is  limited only by the amount of memory accessible to the
VTR 6050.  The VTR 6050 accepts and executes commands sent from the host
computer and can digitize, store and play back voice  messages.    Input
and  output  can  be  sent  via telephone.   The VTR also has a built-in
floppy drive for extra vocabulary storage.

Tony,

You probably know all of this already, and it's probably of no interest, but
just in case ...

Subject: SUMMARY: speech recognition/synthesis software

Hi Sun-Gurus,

Here is the summary of the available speech recognition/synthesis software for
sun running SunOs 4.1.x. Sorry for the delay in my summary.

Speech Recognition Software for SunOs 4.1.x:

1. Voice Commander from In3
---------------------------

IN3 is a speech recognition system. This recognizes the speaker's voice for the
given set of vocabulary. And when the same speaker speaks one of the words in
the vocabulary, IN3 matches and does the action. This is available from:

Command Corp. Inc.
3675 Crestwood Parkway
P.O. Box 956099
Duluth, GA  30136-9502

Phone   (404) 925-7950
FAX     (404) 925-7924
E-Mail
usenet:  ..!emory!gacc!in3

Price: $495.00


2. SayIt from Qualix
--------------------

SayIt lets users create time-saving voice-activated macros that can include any
sequence of keyboard or mouse input. All macros can be activated via voice
commands or keyboard/mouse commands. This dramatically increases user
productivity and makes SayIt two products in one:
   - Voice command software
   - Powerful macro builder

NOTE: In the September 93' issue of UnixWorld magazine, a review of SayIt and
In3 has been published.


3. TruVoice from Centigram
--------------------------

Text-to-Speech converter that gives any application the ability to speak. It
converts text into spoken English and Spanish. The demo software looks good. It
could convert most of the written English lines into speech.

Demo version is available in Catalyst CDWARE from SUN.
