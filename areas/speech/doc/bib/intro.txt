I'm posting this reply as I think it is of general interest and I'd
appreciate feedback for generating a FAQ answer.

Good background to speech analysis with some speech recognition:

 Digital processing of speech signals; Lawrence R. Rabiner, Ronald W. Schafer.
 Englewood Cliffs; London: Prentice-Hall, 1978

 Voice and Speech Processing; T. W. Parsons.
 New York; McGraw Hill

General introduction books on speech recognition:

 Speech recognition by machine; W.A. Ainsworth
 London: Peregrinus on behalf of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, c1988

 Speech synthesis and recognition; J.N. Holmes
 Wokingham: Van Nostrand Reinhold, c1988

 Electronic speech recognition: techniques, technology and applications
 edited by Geoff Bristow,  London: Collins, 1986

A collection of papers I like which I think is both a good introduction and
a fair statement of stare-of-the-art is:

 Readings in speech recognition; edited by Alex Waibel & Kai-Fu Lee.
 San Mateo: Morgan Kaufmann, c1990

More specific books:

 Hidden Markov models for speech recognition; X.D. Huang, Y. Ariki, M.A. Jack.
 Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, c1990

 Automatic speech recognition: the development of the SPHINX system;
 by Kai-Fu Lee; Boston; London: Kluwer Academic, c1989

Major speech journals are:

 IEEE Speech Processing (from Jan 93)
 Computer Speech and Language, Academic Press

Major speech conferences are:

 ICASSP	    International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing
 ICSLP	    International Conference on Spoken Language Processing
 EUROSPEECH European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology

Another good introductory book, perhaps less technical than the ones Tony
Robinson mentions (hi, Tony) is:

Douglas O'Shaughnessy -- Speech Communication: Human and Machine
(Addison Wesley series in Electrical Engineering: Digital Signal Processing,
1987).
