Subject:  [23] What is the difference between Fuzzy Logic and
               Probability Theory? 

The distinction between fuzzy logic and probability theory has to do
with the difference between the notions of probability and degree of
membership. The former has to do with the likelihood that a statement
is true. The statement is either true or false, but not both. The
probability indicates the likelihood of either outcome.
The latter, which is a fuzzy measure, is a true statement
that represents the degree to which a variable belongs in a particular
class. There is only one outcome -- the degree of membership is a true
statement -- and that's the degree to which the variable belongs to a
particular set.

For an example, see the swamp water example by James Bezdek of the
University of West Florida that appeared in EDN, 38(7):103(4), March
31, 1993.
