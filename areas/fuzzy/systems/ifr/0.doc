Package:      areas/fuzzy/systems/ifr/

Name:         IFR_Fuzzy

Summary:      Fuzzy control toolbox for MATLAB.

Version:      7-MAR-94

Description: 

   This directory contains IFR_fuzzy, an easy to use fuzzy-control
   toolbox for MATLAB.  Fuzzy variables and rules can be entered and
   edited with M-files, or through GUI-tools (Matlab Version 4.x).
   Several arithmetic operators on fuzzy sets, fuzzification and
   defuzzification algorithms are provided.

   Computationally extensive algorithms are implemented as Cmex functions.

Requires:     The program should run on MATLAB Versions from PC-Matlab
              to Matlab Version 4.x. 

Ports:        It has been tested on MATLAB version 4.0, SGI and IBM
              RS6000 workstations, and on PC-Matlab, on a PC-386.
