Name:         GAF

Summary:      Adaptive fuzzy logic using Genetic Algorithms

Version:      1.10b (26-JAN-94)

Description: 

   Genetic-Adapt FuzzyWare (GAF) provides off-line simulation,
   adaptation, and eventually on-line adaptive control.  GAF builds run
   time data directly from fuzzy IF-THEN rule segments contained in
   English like text files.

   GAF allows users to generate a fuzzy control system by simply defining
   the inputs, outputs, data set, and initial rule sets.  GAF uses genetic
   algorithm to derive proper rules and fuzzy sets from the initial rules. 
   By changing, adding, deleting rules and fuzzy membership sets, the genetic
   algorithm automatically adapts and optimizes the fuzzy control system. 

Requires:     IBM PC (EGA/VGA), DOS 3.0 or higher. Color VGA recommended.

Ports:
