<H2>FIDE Demo: Fuzzy Inference Development Environment</H2>

Fide is a PC based fuzzy logic design tool that runs under Windows.
Fide provides tools for the development, debugging and simulation
of fuzzy applications.

This software package contains a demonstration version of Fide Version
2.0.  It is operational only with the included examples, with the
following restrictions: You cannot save files, use the Fide Compiler,
use the Real Time Code (RTC) generator, or use the Make functions of
the Composer application. Sample RTC output file for the supported
Motorola micro-controller chips have been included.

The fully functional version of FIDE may be purchased from Aptronix
(see Contact below) and includes a graphical membership function
editor, a rule matrix editor, a "Tracer" tool to trace inference unit
output back to the contributing rules, a tool for the graphical
depiction of the inference unit transfer function, and a signal
generator for driving the inference unit. It can also generate ANSI C,
Matlab script, and Assembly code for the MC6805, MC6808, MC68HC05,
MC68HC11, MC68HC16, and MC68HC33x Motorola micro controller chips.
Fide also has a Composer tool where the inference unit may be
integrated into a block diagram of the complete system for further
debugging and development.

See the INFO file for more information and installation instructions.
