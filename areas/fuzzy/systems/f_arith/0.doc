Package:      areas/fuzzy/systems/f_arith/

Name:         

Summary:      Fuzzy Arithmetic Library

Version:      alpha (October 1994)

Description: 

   This package contains a very simple implementation of a fuzzy number
   representation using confidence intervals, together with the basic
   arithmetic operators and trigonometrical functions.

Requires:     C++

Ports:        It has been tested with Borland C++ 3.1 and djgpp 1.11
              under MS-DOS, and with gcc 2.5.8 under Linux and Hp-Ux.
