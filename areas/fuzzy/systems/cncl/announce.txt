A new version 0.22 of CNCL - the Communication Network Class Library for
C++ - is available at ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/CNCL. I'll also
upload it to sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming.

Included is the source code and LINUX binaries.

Software requirements:

	- C++ compiler with IOstreams library
	- perl
	- GNU bison
	- GNU flex



CNCL is a C++ library with the following features:

Universal classes:

	* Tree structured class hierarchy, similar to NIHCL.

	* Classes for general purposes such as arrays, linked lists,
	  strings.

	* Interface classes for UNIX system calls: pipes, select, sockets.

Simulation:

	* Event driven simulation classes.

	* Statistical evaluation classes.

	* Random number generator and distribution classes.

	* SDL-oriented simulation classes.

Fuzzy logic:

      	* Fuzzy sets, fuzzy variables, fuzzy rules and inference
	  engine for building fuzzy controllers and expert systems.

	* Fuzzy rules to C++ class compiler.

Graphics:

	* Interface classes for DEC's ezd graphics server.

	* Interface classes for Communication Networks' gist graphics
	  server.


See directory doc/ for more documentation on CNCL.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Compiling and installing CNCL:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! You MUST have perl (Larry Wall's script language) installed in order   !!
!! to use the CNgenclass and CNarray scripts (which are written in perl). !!
!! Having perl is a good idea anyway, so install perl now!!! ;-)          !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(Compiling CNCL without perl using this distribution should work
nevertheless.)

You'll also need GNU bison and flex to compile the CNfrc fuzzy rule
compiler. At least on SUNOS 4.1.3 it's not possible to compile
fuzzlex.c and fuzzyparse.c with GNU g++, if these are generated by
lex and yacc. If you don't have bison and flex, it may be possible to
compile the yacc and lex generated C code with an Standard-C compiler
like gcc. See bin/fuzzy/Makefile. If you don't want to compile this
program, comment out `FUZZYDIR= fuzzy' in bin/Makefile.

[ ... detailed instructions deleted for announcement ... ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of CNCL is known to compile and run on the following
systems:

	* SUN SPARCstation, SUNOS 4.1.3,
	  GNU g++ 2.5.8,
	  libg++ 2.5.3

	* LINUX 1.1.30
	  GNU g++ 2.5.8,
	  libc 4.5.24 / libg++ 2.5.3l.2


There is a bug in g++ 2.5.8 manifesting for the function

    void EZD::draw_text(int x, int y, int w, int h, CNStringR align,
			CNStringR text, CNStringR col, CNStringR font);

if you pass temporary CNString objects to this function. Some of them
will be deleted twice. Hopefully this will be fixed in g++ 2.6.x. See
also comment in lib/ezd/EZD.h.
