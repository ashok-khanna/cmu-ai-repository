M.Abbod,

Hi netter,

I announced that Fuzzy Inference Systems toolbox for MATLAB is
available last week. I have been surprised by vast response
from different group of users. At first I tried to post the files
individually based on the request. It seems a very tough job for
me now and I decided to keep the files in an anonymous ftp site.

Since the programs have been tested on MATLAB version 4.1, Sun
workstation, some of users who are interested to work with PC asked
me to take into account this point. I have done some modification
and now PC users are also able to use this toolbox.

HOW TO GET FISMAT

The "Fuzzy Inference Systems toolbox for MATLAB" is available via
anonymous FTP from:

     SERVER: ftp.mathworks.com    [144.212.100.10]

     FILE: /pub/contrib/misc/fuzzy_inference_systems.sh

           or (for PC),

           /pub/contrib/misc/pc_fuzzy_inference_systems.sh

This is a shell archive (produced by shar 3.50). To extract the
files from this archive type "sh file_name".

Upon competition, a new directory "fismat" will be created on your
working directory.


SUMMARY

Fuzzy inference systems toolbox for MATLAB ,FISMAT, accommodates
different arithmetic operators, fuzzification and defuzzification
algorithm, implication relations, and different method of approximate
reasoning such as Compositional Rule of Inference (CRI) and Approximate
Analogical Reasoning Scheme based on Similarity Measure.

To have a quick review of FIS and become familiar with developed
functions, a demonstration file "fisdemo.m" is provided. Therefore
after retrieving the files it is recommended to go through different
part of demo. The demonstration includes fuzzy controller demo which
investigate three well-known examples in control systems. These are
truck backer-upper control, inverted pendulum system (cart-pole), and
temperature and humidity control of a bathroom.

To become familiar with terminology used for FIS and also the list of
references for each function, a postscript file "fismat.ps" also
provided.

NOTE:

It is to be noted that FISMAT is a public domain program, therefore
no one is allowed to sell or re-distribute the programs with his/her
name. The permission for revision and re-distribution is given subject
to keep the header (s) of functions.

I am looking forward to hear your suggestion, comments or any possibly
errors.
