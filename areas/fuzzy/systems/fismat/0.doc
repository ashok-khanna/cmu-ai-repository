Summary:      Fuzzy Inference Systems toolbox for MATLAB

Version:      25-OCT-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Fuzzy Inference Systems toolbox for MATLAB
   (FISMAT). FISMAT accommodates different arithmetic operators,
   fuzzification and defuzzification algorithm, implication relations,
   and different method of approximate reasoning such as Compositional
   Rule of Inference (CRI) and Approximate Analogical Reasoning Scheme
   based on Similarity Measure.

   To have a quick review of FIS and become familiar with developed
   functions, a demonstration file "fisdemo.m" is provided. Therefore
   after retrieving the files it is recommended to go through different
   part of demo. The demonstration includes fuzzy controller demo which
   investigate three well-known examples in control systems. These are
   truck backer-upper control, inverted pendulum system (cart-pole), and
   temperature and humidity control of a bathroom.

   To become familiar with terminology used for FIS and also the list of
   references for each function, see the provided postscript file
   "fismat.ps".
