Summary:      Fuzzy Logic Inference Engine

Version:      21-AUG-93

Description: 

   FLIE (Fuzzy Logic Inference Engine) has been developed at and used by
   the Institute of Robotics (IfR), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
   Zurich (ETH). It is written entirely in MacMETH a dialect of Modula-2
   for Macintosh computers also developed at the ETH. MacMETH is
   distributed free of charge by anonymous ftp from neptune.ethz.ch
   directory macmeth. All source code is included.

   CFLIE is a C version of FLIE written by Ahmet Sekercioglu, Swinburne
   University of Technology, Australia.

   FUN (Fuzzy Using Neural networks) implements some learning strategies
   for fuzzy rule based systems. Currently the source code is not ready
   for distribution; interested parties should contact one of the listed
   contacts at the ETH.
