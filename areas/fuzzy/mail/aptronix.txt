BEGIN

HELP
    This message.
    Use "send mserv.help" for a more detailed description on how to use the
    mail server.
REPLY <address>
    Specify return address for replies. Use this if you are not sure
    that your mail system generates correct return addresses.
MAIL <address>
    Requests will be sent via email to <address>.
LIMIT <number>
    Maximum number of Kbytes to be sent per transfer. Default is 64K
    bytes for email.
    The limit applies to subsequent "send" commands.
[ENCODING] { BTOA | UUENCODE }
    Specify encoding to be used. Default is UUENCODE. The encoding
    applies to subsequent "send" commands.
CWD [<path>]
    Sets or cancels the current working directory for subsequent
    commands.
DIR [<path>]
    Returns a list of files in <path>.
INDEX [<item>...]
    Look up everything in the archives that matches the <item>s. If
    no <item>s are specified, requests for a file named "INDEX".
SEARCH <item> [<item>...]
    Look up the indicated archive entries, and return a list of files
    found.
SEND <item> [<item>...]
    Specify the items to be sent.
RESEND <item> <part> [<part>...]
    Re-sends the indicated <parts> from the specified <item>. The
    encoding and limit must be identical to those used in the
    original request.
PACK { TAR | ZOO | ZIP | OFF }
    Subsequent requests must specify directories, which will be
    packed using the indicated method and transferred.
    PACK OFF cancels packing.
END
    Terminate command processing. The remainder of the input will be
    ignored.

Case is not significant in the command verbs, but it *IS* significant
in <path> and <item> specifications.

will be discarded (without notice) in the future:
    root uucp mailer MAILER-DAEMON news daemon demon deliver sendmail
