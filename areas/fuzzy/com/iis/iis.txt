Introduced by Lotfi Zadeh, Fuzzy Logic methods may be used to 
design intelligent systems utilizing knowledge expressed in natural 
language.  This methodology, an important source of artificial 
intelligence applications, permits the processing of both symbolic 
and numerical information.  Fuzzy logic has been applied to control 
trains (Sendai subway), elevators, household appliances, cameras, and 
manufacturing processes.  Systems designed and developed utilizing 
fuzzy-logic methods have been shown to be more efficient than those 
based on conventional approaches.  In combination with Computational 
Neural Networks techniques, fuzzy-logic methods may be used to design 
robust adaptive control systems.  

This course discusses the application of fuzzy logic and neural 
networks techniques to the design of fuzzy and hybrid neuro-fuzzy 
systems.  More than 11 case studies will be discussed in detail.  At
the completion of this course, you will have a full understanding of 
the benefits of this technology, will know  about existing successful 
applications, and will develop the necessary understanding and
knowledge to design and apply fuzzy logic to your particular needs.

Who Should Attend: 

Engineers, technical managers and project leaders, scientists, 
systems analysts, as well as others who would like to have more 
knowledge about this emerging technology.

About the course: 

This is the strongest and most complete course 
available on this topic. All the presenters of this course are 
pioneers of the field, including Professor Lotfi Zadeh, who 
introduced its seminal ideas and concepts.  Even if you have already 
taken a course or  tutorial on fuzzy logic, you should try to attend 
this course since it will provide you with a deeper understanding of 
the latest techniques and applications in the areas of fuzzy logic, 
soft computing, pattern recognition, intelligent control, 
computational neural networks, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems.

Hands-on and Problem Solving Sessions:

Include presentations by commercial tool developers on their available
software and hardware products for fuzzy logic.

Although early forms of neural networks have existed since the 
1960's, advances in hardware, software, and neural algorithms have 
brought this technology to the fore for the 1990's.  Neural networks 
can be trained and can self-learn to recognize patterns, to recognize 
speech, to predict weather from pressure patterns, and to perform 
control functions of considerable complexity.  It is expected that this 
new technology will  play an important role in the control of power 
systems, of industrial plants, of robotic systems, and in many other 
practical applications.  They also represent an exciting opportunity 
for custom parallel architectures.  Genetic algorithms are useful in 
solving many problems, including optimization problems in non-
linear multi-dimensional spaces. Genetic programming extends the 
genetic algorithm to the domain of computer programs.  In genetic 
programming, populations of programs are genetically bred to solve 
problems.  Genetic programming can solve problems in system 
identification, classification, control, robotics, optimization, and 
pattern recognition.  

About this course: 

This course discusses the application of neural networks and genetic 
algorithms to the design of intelligent systems.  Many case studies 
will be discussed in detail.  At the completion of this course, you will 
have a full understanding of the benefits of neural networks and 
genetic algorithms, will know about existing successful applications, 
and will develop the necessary knowledge to design and apply 
neural network and genetic algorithms to your particular needs. 

Hands-on and Problem Solving Sessions:

an Associate Professor at the Oregon Graduate Institute where he is 
pursuing research in massively parallel VLSI architectures, and is 
the founder and Chief Technical Officer of Adaptive Solutions, Inc. He 
is the architect of the Adaptive Solutions CNAPS neurocomputer.  He 
has been a Visiting Professor at the Royal Institute of Technology in 
Stockholm, Sweden.  Dr. Hammerstrom's research interests are in the 
area of the VLSI architectures for pattern recognition.  He has been 
an Associate Editor for the Journal of the International Neural 
Network Society, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, and the 
International Journal of Neural Networks.  

John R. Koza is a consulting professor in the  computer science 
department at Stanford University.  He is  author of the 1992 book 
Genetic Programming: On the  Programming of Computers by Means 
of Natural Selection from the MIT Press and a 1994 book Genetic 
Programming  II: Scalable Automatic Programming by Means of
