Ok, here's a shot at it.  I suspect that you'll find this far too long, so
please suggest any cuts you think would be appropriate.  As you can see, we
really do have a lot of products available.
    --------
Togai InfraLogic, Inc. (TIL) is a supplier of fuzzy logic and fuzzy expert
system software and hardware.  Our products are listed below.  For more
information, write to Togai InfraLogic, Inc., 5 Vanderbilt, Irvine, CA 92718,
call +1 714 975 8522, fax +1 714 975 8524, or send email to info@til.com or
til!info.  TIL also supports an email-server that can be reached at
fuzzy-server@til.com or til!fuzzy-server.  Send an email message that contains
just the word "help" in either the subject line or the message body for more
information.

Software products:

  o TILShell+ is a graphical CASE tool for fuzzy expert system development,
    which includes facilities for editing, simulating and tuning fuzzy expert
    systems.  It interfaces directly with all of TIL's software and hardware
    development system products.  It is currently available for IBM PC
    compatibles running Microsoft Windows 3.1, and versions are under
    development for the NEC PC and Sun Sparcs running OpenWindows.  For these
    platforms, the previous version, which lacks the simulation facility, is
    still available.

  o Fuzzy-C Development System (FCDS)

    The FCDS is a compiler that translates from TIL's Fuzzy Programming
    Language (FPL (tm)) to either K&R or ANSI C source code.

  o FC110 Development System (FC110DS)

    The FC110DS contains an FPL compiler, assembler and linker for the TIL
    FC110 Digital Fuzzy Processor described below.

  o MicroFPL Development System (MicroFPLDS)

    The MicroFPLDS family of products provide fuzzy processing capability to
    embedded microcontrollers.  The package includes a compiler that generates
    a compact representation of the fuzzy expert system to be evaluated, and
    a runtime module to interpret the fuzzy expert system.  Versions are
    available that target Hitachi's HMCS400, H8/300 and H8/500 families,
    Intel's 8051, Mitsubishi's 37450, Motorola's MC68HC11, and Oki's 66201.
    This product is not currently available on the Sun.

  o TILGen

    TILGen is a tool for automatically constructing fuzzy expert systems from
    data sampled off an existing system.  It uses Dr. Bart Kosko's Differential
    Competitive Learning (DCL) technique.

  Unless otherwise noted, all software products are available for IBM- or NEC-
  compatible PCs running Microsoft Windows 3.1, and for Sun Sparc machines
  running OpenWindows.

Hardware products:

  o FC110 Digital Fuzzy Processor

    The FC110 DFP(tm) is an all-digital, all-CMOS high-speed fuzzy micro-
    processor that is capable of acting either as a stand-alone main processor
    or as a fuzzy accelerator for a host processor.  It is capable of fuzzy
    processing up to 220,000 2-input, 1-output rules per second.

  o IBM PC/AT FC110 Accelerator Board (FCA10AT)

    This board contains an FC110 with 128KB of knowledge base RAM.  The FC110
    and the knowledge base memory are fully accessible from the host computer.

  o FC110 Development Module (FCD10SA)

    This board contains an FC110, a 128KB EPROM and an extended address
    decoder.  It is intended to be used to add fuzzy acceleration to existing
    board designs without requiring a redesign.

  o Single Board Fuzzy Controller (FCD10SB)

    This board contains an FC110, 128KB EPROM, 8 channels of A/D, 4 channels
    of D/A, a serial port, a parallel port, timers, and an interface connector
    through which the FC110 and its peripherals can be accessed by a host
    processor.  It is intended to be built into devices as a standalone fuzzy
    controller.

  o SBus Dual-FC110 Accelerator Board (FCD10SBus)

    This board contains two independent fuzzy acceleration subsystems, each
    with its own FC110 and 128KB of knowledge base RAM.  The FC110s and
    knowledge base memory are fully accessible from the host processor.  A
    device driver for SunOS is supplied.

  o VME Quad-FC110 Accelerator Board (FCA10VME)

    This board contains four independent fuzzy acceleration subsystems, each
    with its own FC110 and 128KB of knowledge base RAM.  The FC110s and
    knowledge base memory are fully accessible from the host processor.

  o Fuzzy Computational Acceleration (FCA (tm))

    FCA is TIL's new system for embedding fuzzy processing capabilities
    in VLSI devices.  This technology allows us to construct fuzzy processing
    blocks for customer ASICs in a minimum of time and at minimum cost.  The
    system is capable of scaling from 8 bit to 32 bit precision.
