Hi, fuzzy netters,

recently there were quite a few questions in comp.ai.fuzzy concerning 
tools for the design of fuzzy systems. So I would like to draw your 
attention to SIEFUZZY V1.0, our CAE tool for fuzzy system design.

SIEFUZZY is a software development tool which provides a way to describe 
fuzzy logic systems, test the systems through simulation, compile the 
system for further online testing, or compile the finished system into the 
output C-code necessary for the final implementation on the target 
processor.  The implemented system can define the complete application or 
can be integrated into an existing application.

SIEFUZZY can be used to develop fuzzy systems for control, information 
processing, expert systems, financial forecasting, decision-aiding tools, 
or any other area in which fuzzy logic is applicable.

SIEFUZZY has been jointly developed by Togai InfraLogic, Inc., and Siemens 
AG.  "TILShell 3.0 Professional Edition" is the Togai InfraLogic, Inc., 
proprietary name for SIEFUZZY. 

Fuzzy logic systems are rule-based systems which generally consist of a 
collection of rules of the following form:
  If (A is HIGH) AND (B is MED) THEN C = MED 
where A and B are the input variables to the system, C is the output 
variable, and HIGH and MED are fuzzy sets, or membership functions, 
defined on the input and output variables.  

SIEFUZZY provides editors for creating each part of a fuzzy logic rulebase:
variables, membership functions, and rules.  These editors allow you to 
enter descriptions of variables, membership functions, rules, and the 
connections between variables and rulebases in a graphical, point and 
click environment.

The description of a fuzzy system in SIEFUZZY is maintained in the Fuzzy 
Programming Language (FPL TM).  Each time a change is made through one of 
the editors in SIEFUZZY, the FPL description of the system is updated to 
reflect the changes made.

Once the system has been completely described, it can be tested using the 
various debugging and tuning facilities of SIEFUZZY.  These facilities 
include static and dynamic testing facilities.  For static testing, you 
can enter specific values for the inputs of your system and then observe 
the values of the outputs, or plot a 3-dimensional representation of the 
relationship between two inputs and one output of your system over a given 
range of input values.  With a cursor you can move around in the control 
surface and identify exactly the rules and membership functions 
responsible for e.g. a spike in that surface.  For dynamic testing, you 
can test your system as it runs with a simulation of the final application 
and observe the behavior of each rule, membership function, and their 
interactions.  Or as a final test, you can link SIEFUZZY via a serial 
connection to an external processor which is actually running the final 
application, and make changes to the system "online", i.e. without 
recompilation, and observe the results.  Both in simulation and in online 
tuning trigger conditions can be set to detect exeptional states of the 
fuzzy system.  The backtracking mode allows an analysis of the behaviour 
that led into the exeptional state of the system.  

SIEFUZZY includes more advanced features like DDE support, user defined 
extensions of FPL and user defined utilities.  SIEFUZZY supports Dynamic 
Data Exchange (DDE) under Windows.  This feature allows you to link 
SIEFUZZY as either a client or server to other applications, which support 
DDE, e.g MatLab, as well as linking two instances of SIEFUZZY.  SIEFUZZY 
also supports user defined fuzzy operators, objects, and 
inference/defuzzification methods.  This feature allows you to test 
systems which use your own specialized methods using the simulation 
facility.  SIEFUZZY supports user defined utilities.  This feature allows 
you to call other applications from a SIEFUZZY menu command.

Prices of SIEFUZZY are:

single user licence:            DM 3980,- 
university single user licence: DM 2900,-
