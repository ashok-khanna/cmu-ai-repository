Summary:      Computer simulations of animal behavior (Toby Tyrrell)

Version:      

Description: 

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell for his PhD
   thesis.  The thesis examines the problem of action selection when
   dealing with realistic, animal-like situations: how to choose, at each
   moment in time, the most appropriate out of a repertoire of possible
   actions.  It includes a description is given of a simulated
   environment which is an extensive and detailed simulation of the
   problem of action selection for animals.  This simulated environment
   is used to investigate the adequacy of several theories of action
   selection (from both ethology and artificial intelligence) such as the
   drive model, Lorenz's psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading
   activation network, and outlines deficiencies in each mechanism.
   Finally, it proposes a new approach to action selection is developed
   which determines the most appropriate action in a principled way, and
   which does not suffer from the inherent shortcomings found in other
   methods. The thesis includes a review and bibliography of existing
   work on action selection.

   The action selection problem modeled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing,
   not getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc.), many internal
   and external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.
