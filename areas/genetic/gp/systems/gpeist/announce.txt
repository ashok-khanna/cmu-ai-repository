The latest version of GPEIST has been placed in the GP code archive.
The archive can be found at ftp.cc.utexas.edu. Log in as anonymous
and go to pub/genetic-programming/code.

GPEIST is stored in the file GPEIST3.zip or GPEIST3.tar.gz. These files 
contain:

      GA.st        Contains algorithm classes
      GAEnv.st     Contains environment class code
      GAObj.st     Contains classes for various genetically-manipulated objs.
      GAUI.st      Contains user interface code
      GPEIST.ps    A document describing aspects of GPEIST
      TBrowser.st  Supporting code for the display of trees
      closeNoT.st  Fixes a bug in ST80
      filer        Access this to file in all code
      padded.st    Utility which pads strings to a specific length
      psprint.st   Postscript printing class code

GPEIST is implemented in VisualWorks (Smalltalk 80). GPEIST provides 
a framework for implementing and monitoring GP experiments. A single 
experiment has been provided as an example - the Ant Trail Problem 
with John Muir and Santa Fe trails.

A number of browsers/inspectors are included with the system:

   (1) A graphical browser that displays the fittest program to date.
   (2) A report browser giving fitness, size and depth statistics.
   (3) A population inspector that can load and save populations.
   (4) A chart browser allowing the display of fitness, size and depth stats.
   (5) An animation browser (for the Ant Trail Problem).

Hardcopy output (postscript) of charts, programs and animations is
possible with this release of the software. All output is scaled
in order to fit on a single page. Also in this release, the evolution
of genetic programs occurs in background in order that it's possible
to interact with any Smalltalk window. Simulations can be suspended! 

Questions and comments to my email address please. Anyone requiring
an example experimental definition should contact me.

I hope that the code proves to be useful.
