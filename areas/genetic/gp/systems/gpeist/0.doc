   A number of browsers/inspectors are included with the system:

      (1) A graphical browser that displays the fittest program to date.

      (2) A report browser giving fitness, size and depth statistics.

      (3) A population inspector that can load and save populations.

      (4) A chart browser allowing the display of fitness, size and
          depth stats. 

      (5) An animation browser (for the Ant Trail Problem).
