Summary:      A Karl Sims Genetic Art Workalike

Version:      22-MAR-93

Description: 

   This directory contains GPX/Abstractica, a Karl Sims Genetic Art
   workalike. Abstractica applies Genetic Programming, using your good
   taste as a fitness function, to the generation of abstract images.

   Two different versions of the software are included --

       abs.tgz          Normal executables. Try this one first.

       abs_stat.tgz     Same as above, but linked with the -Bstatic option
                        for portability to systems which have their sharable
                        libraries installed funny.  Try this one if the
                        other doesn't work.

   Source code is not included because the authors do not have the
   rights to distribute some of the user-interface, image manipulation,
   and memory management routines.
