GPQUICK is a simple GP system in C++.

GPQUICK features an elegant object architecture with function
(Function), program (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  
The Problem class is proposed as a portable representation for problems 
that would be source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.

GPQUICK as provided uses a steady state GA, tournament selection, one
type of mutation, and subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear
representation for S-expressions.

It includes documentation from the associated magazine article (Byte,
"Some Assembly Required", February 1994).  

GPQUICK is available at - 
   HOST: ftp.cc.utexas.edu
   DIRECTORY: /pub/genetic-programming/code
   FILES: gpquick.tar, gpquick.zip

GPQUICK.TAR is a UNIX version (tested with CC and g++).
GPQUICK.ZIP is a PC/ANSI version (tested with Borland 3.1).
