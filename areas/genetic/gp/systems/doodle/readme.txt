DOODLE GARDEN SCREEN SAVER

		INTRODUCTION

Doodle Garden Screen Saver uses a technique called Genetic Programming 
to evolve new drawings ("doodles") from a basic set (screen).

A small computer program draws each doodle.  The screen saver mutates 
(randomly changes) a doodle program, or crosses programs (attach part of 
one to part of another) with interesting results.  When the screen saver 
is activated, it automatically generates new doodles every few seconds 
by mutating and crossing the doodles that make up the base screen.  By 
selecting your favorite Doodle Garden Screen, you are exploring Genetic 
Programming and a fascinating visual space.

		INSTALLATION

Doodle Garden requires Microsoft Windows.

Copy the program file (DOODSAVE.SCR), the info file (DOODSAVE.WRI) as 
well the assortment of screen saver files (with the extension .SCN) into 
your Windows directory.

To Activate:
	1. In Program Manager, double click on the Control Panel icon 
(normally located in the Main program group).
	2.  Double click on the Desktop icon, or select Settings | Desktop 
from the menu bar.  The desktop dialog box will appear.
	3. Approximately in the middle of the dialog box are controls 
grouped together under Screen Saver.  Choose Doodle Garden from the Name 
drop-down listbox.  (You may also adjust the duration of inactivity 
before the screen saver kicks in.)
	4. Select the Setup button.  The Doodle Garden Configuration 
dialog appears.  Set the parameters as desired, and select OK.
	5. If you wish to test the screen saver, select the Test button.  
Once you move the mouse or press a key, the screen saver stops and the 
"shareware irritant" dialog box appears.  Select OK to remove the dialog 
box.  (Info displays this file.)
	6. If you wish to experiment with the behavior of the screen 
saver, or change the screen used,  repeat steps 4 and 5 as often as you 
like.
	7. Once you're satisfied with the screen saver and configuration 
settings, select OK in the Desktop dialog box.  

The Doodle Garden Screen Saver is now active, and will automatically run

		CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

The Screen Saver Configuration dialog box changes allows you to adjust 
the timing, display and screen used when animating..

Refresh Delay is the number of seconds between screen generations.  As 
you 
increase this number, the display changes less frequently. 

Reverse Video will give you a black background for the animated doodles. 

Random Order causes the doodles to be displayed in random order rather 
than 
top to bottom, left to right.

Hide Parents will hide the doodles which are mutated and cross-bred 
during animation.  If this is not checked, the display mode will be 
Normal.

There are four different types of display modes:
	Normal will display each doodle in a separate frame.
	Overflow will allow doodles to overflow into neighboring frames.
	Solo will display one large doodle at a time.
	Graffiti will display as Overflow, but doodles drawn will not be 
erased when a screen is completed; the next set of doodles will simply 
be drawn on top of the previous screen.

There are four different types of 
	All Cross will Cross on every screen, with no Mutation screens.
	Half Cross will Mutate and Cross on alternate screens.
	One Cross will Mutate each parent, and then Cross once.
	No Cross will Mutate each parent and then start over, with no 
Cross screens.

Finally, you may choose the Screen Saver file that is used as the base 
screen for animation.  Each contains one or more doodles that are then 
mutated or cross-bred with another doodle to produce interesting 
variations.

You can use SCN files created by other users with your screen saver.  
Interactive Doodle Garden, the registered version of Doodle Garden, 
allows you to evolve your own screens and save them as screen savers.
