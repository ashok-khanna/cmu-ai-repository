    This folder contains a USENET posting entitled:

	 "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation"

that is currently edited by David Beasley <David.Beasley@cm.cf.ac.uk>

    The FAQ is posted (in 6 pieces) quarterly, usually on 20th, to the
newsgroup "comp.ai.genetic"; it's also available in this ASCII format
from the FAQ server at MIT, as shown below.

    It's the definitive guide to resources concerning the field of EC,
and the "evolutionary part" of Artificial Life. But please BE WARNED,
the style used to present all this otherwise tremendously "dry stuff" is
intended to be satirical, and thus should not be read if you'd prefer a
*scientific* introduction to the field.

    The FAQ project is considered to be a layman's (aka students)
introduction to EC, and (possibly) to give pointers to most EC resources
that are currently available.

    Between posting it's available in its ASCII form. (from part 2 of the
FAQ):
