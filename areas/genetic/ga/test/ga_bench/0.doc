Summary:      Genetic Algorithms Benchmarks and Test Problems

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains genetic algorithms benchmarks and test problems.

   The file others.tgz contains references to collections of machine
   learning test problems that may be of interest.

   Please note that the files still aren't very well annotated and are
   offered on an as-is basis.  Eventually, a standard way to specify the
   parameters and various encodings of them for these problems will be
   recorded along with the code.
