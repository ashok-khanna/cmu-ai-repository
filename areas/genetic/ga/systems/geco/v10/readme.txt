Bug reports, improvements, and feature requests should be sent to
george@hsvaic.boeing.com. I will try to respond to them. Ports to other
lisps are also welcome.

GECO should be completely portable among CLtL2 compliant Common Lisps,
though it has presently been tested only with the following lisp
implementations:
 - MCL 2.0 (Apple's Macintosh Common Lisp)
