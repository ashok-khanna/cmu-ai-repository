Name:         SGA-C

Summary:      C port and extension of Goldberg's Simple Genetic Algorithm

Version:      1.1 shar (6-NOV-92) 1.1 tar (11-AUG-93, 2-MAR-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains SGA-C, a C-language port and extension of
   the original Pascal SGA code presented in Goldberg's book.  The
   operation is essentially the same as that of the original Pascal
   version.  See TCGA report 91002 for a description of SGA-C.

Requires:     C
