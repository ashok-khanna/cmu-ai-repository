     This disk contains copies of the programs presented in the book
GENETIC ALGORITHMS IN SEARCH, OPTIMIZATION, AND MACHINE LEARNING by
David E. Goldberg.  The programs were compiled on an IBM PC/XT using
Borland International's Turbo Pascal Version 3.  This disk is provided
as an educational courtesy, however, and no warranties are made
regarding the fitness of any program contained herein for any use.
     The disk is subdivided into four subdirectories:
     APPENDB
     SGA
     SCS
     MISC
Subdirectory APPENDB contains the programs of Appendix B together with
the pseudo-random number generator code.  Subdirectory SGA contains
the files needed for the simple genetic algorithm code of Chapter 3.
Subdirectory SCS contains the program and data files needed for the
simple classifier system of Chapter 6.
     The subdirectory MISC contains the other snippets of code that
are scattered throughout the book:
     TEST2.DOM      - Test section for SGADOM (dominance) code
     OPERATOR.DOM   - Modified operators for SGADOM
     GENERATE.DOM   - Modified generation coordinator for SGADOM
     SCALE.SGA      - Routines to implement linear scaling
     MAPPED.SGA     - Routines to implement mapped, concatenated codes
     SELECT2.SGA    - Routines to implement stoch. remainder selection
     GENERATE.TSP   - Partially matched crossover for the TSP
The miscellaneous codes must be inserted into a main program with
appropriate data structures and calling sequences.
