Name:         EM

Summary:      Evolution Machine

Version:      2.2 (23-AUG-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains the Evolution Machine (EM). EM presents a
   collection of evolutionary algorithms (Genetic Algorithms and
   Evolution Strategies) in a common framework.  EM is universally
   applicable to continuous real-coded optimization problems. In the EM,
   the authors have coded fundamental evolutionary algorithms, and added
   some of their approaches to evolutionary search.

   The EM includes extensive menu techniques with:

      * Default parameter setting for inexperienced users.

      * Well-defined entries for  EM- control by freaks of
        the EM,  who want  to leave  the standard  process
        control.

      * Data processing for repeated runs (with or without
        change of the strategy parameters).

      * Graphical presentation of results:
        online presentation of the evolution progress, one-,
        two- and three-dimensional graphic output to analyze
        the fitness function and the evolution process.

      * Integration of calling MS--DOS utilities (Turbo C).

   EM runs on PC's with MS-DOS.

Requires:     C, C++

Ports:        Runs on IBM PCs (MS-DOS).
