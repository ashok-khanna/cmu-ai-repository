<H2>GAL: Simple GA in Lisp</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">areas/genetic/ga/systems/gal/</A>

<listing>
This directory contains GAC, a simple GA (conceptually based on
Grefenstette's Genesis) written in Common Lisp.

Baker's SUS selection algorithm is employed, n-point crossover is
maintained at 60%, and mutation is very low. Selection is based on
proportional fitness. This GA uses generations.  It is also important
to note that this GA maximizes.

A note on crossover is in order. This version of GAC allows for
n-point crossover, where n is less than the length of an individual
(although there is no check for that). It is also possible to run
uniform crossover (see discussion below).

GAC will display run-time information as it executes.  GAC also has
the ability to output this information into files. These statistics
include best behavior, online/ offline measurements, convergence, and
the number of reevaluations per generation. At this time the code is
commented out. The user can simply remove a few comment symbols to use
this facility. See run.c and geval.c for details.

There is no ranking, adaptive operators, etc. We intend to explore
these issues in future work.
