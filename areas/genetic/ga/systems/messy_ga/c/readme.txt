This directory, /pub/src/messyGA/C, contains the messy GA (mGA) in C,
as documented in the technical report IlliGAL 91008, "mGA in C: A
Messy Genetic Algorithm in C", by Kalyanmoy Deb and David E. Goldberg,
September 1991.  For detailed discussion and explanation of the code, 
see the report.  Unfortunately, we currently cannot make that report
available on this ftp server (nor via email), and it is too long to 
duplicate and distribute hardcopy of the entire report.  However, 
the entire discussion is contained in the first 35 pages of the report.
The remaining 80 pages consist of the C source code available in this
directory.  So to obtain the discussion of the code, request hardcopy 
of IlliGAL no. 91008 from the IlliGAL librarian, Eric Thompson, at

and you will be sent the first 35 pages of the report.  We hope to 
make the entire report available on the ftp server in the future.
