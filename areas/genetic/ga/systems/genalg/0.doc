Name:         GENALG

Summary:      Genetic Algorithm package written in Pascal

Version:      3 (21-JUL-90)

Description: 

   This directory contains GENALG, a program that demonstrates the
   operation of genetic algorithms. From a randomly generated population
   of real numbers, it attempts to find a number arbitrarily close to a
   goal real number.

Requires:     Pascal

Ports:        IBM PC executable included.
