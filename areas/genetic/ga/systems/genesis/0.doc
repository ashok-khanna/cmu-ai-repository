Summary:      GENEtic Search Implementation System

Version:      5.0 (October 1990)

Description: 

   This directory contains GENEtic Search Implementation System
   (GENESIS).  GENESIS is system for function optimization based on
   genetic search techniques. Since genetic algorithms are task
   independent optimizers, the user must provide only an "evaluation"
   function which returns a value when given a particular point in the
   search space.

   This version offers several enhancements over previous versions that
   should make the system much more user friendly.  The major improvement
   is a user-level representation that allows the user to think about the
   genetic structures as vectors of real numbers, rather than bit strings.
   This level of representation should make the application of GENESIS to
   new problems easier than ever.  A number of new options have been added,
   including: a display mode that includes an interactive user interface,
   the option to maximize or minimize the objective function, the choice of
   rank-based or proportional selection algorithm, and an option to use a
   Gray code as a transparent lower level representation.

   The purpose of making this system available is to encourage the
   experimental use of genetic algorithms on realistic optimization
   problems, and thereby to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   genetic algorithms.
