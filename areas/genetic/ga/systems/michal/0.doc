Description:

   This directory contains three genetic algorithm numerical
   optimization packages by Zbigniew Michalewicz, as described in his
   book.
   
     GENOCOP     GEnetic algorithm for Numerical Optimization for
                 COnstrained Problems. Optimizes functions with any
                 number of linear constraints (equalities and inequalities)
   
     Genetic-2   Optimization package for the linear transportation
                 problem (minimization of the transportation cost). 
   
     Genetic-2N  Optimization package for the nonlinear transportation
                 problem (minimization of the transportation cost).
