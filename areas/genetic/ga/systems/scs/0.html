SCS (Simple Classifier System) is a C port of the system from
Appendix D of Goldberg's "Genetic Algorithms in Search,
Optimization, and Machine Learning".

The following is a short description on the operation of the simple
classifier system:

   The classifier system randomly generates a starting population
   of classifiers.  The program then generates a random signal to
   the environment (in this case the multiplexer).  The multiplexer
   responds with the environmental message.  The program then attempts
   to match the random signal with the classifiers and those that match
   are allowed to bid.  The strengths of the matching classifiers are
   deducted by the amount that is to be bid specified by the CBID variable
   and the effective bids of the classifiers are compared.  The classifer
   with the largest effective bid (the bid modified by EBID) wins and the
   classifier message is compared with the environmental message.  If the
   messages match, the classifier is given a reward.  If the bucket brigade
   flag is activated, the classifier will post a reward to be given to
   the last matching classifier.  The genetic algorithm is activated at
   the iteration specified by the variable GAPERIOD.  Pairs of
   classifiers are chosen randomly according to their strengths.  Bad
   performing classifiers are replaced according to their similarities
   to the new offsprings.  Data about the population and its parameters
   is recorded in REPORT.OUT at periodic intervals.
