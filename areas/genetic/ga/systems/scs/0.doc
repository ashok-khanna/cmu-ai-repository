Summary:      C port of Goldberg's Simple Classifier System

Version:      19-AUG-93

Description: 

   SCS (Simple Classifier System) is a C port of the system from
   Appendix D of Goldberg's "Genetic Algorithms in Search,
   Optimization, and Machine Learning".

   The following is a short description on the operation of the simple
   classifier system:

      The classifier system randomly generates a starting population
      of classifiers.  The program then generates a random signal to
      the environment (in this case the multiplexer).  The multiplexer
      responds with the environmental message.  The program then attempts
      to match the random signal with the classifiers and those that match
      are allowed to bid.  The strengths of the matching classifiers are
      deducted by the amount that is to be bid specified by the CBID variable
      and the effective bids of the classifiers are compared.  The classifer
      with the largest effective bid (the bid modified by EBID) wins and the
      classifier message is compared with the environmental message.  If the
      messages match, the classifier is given a reward.  If the bucket brigade
      flag is activated, the classifier will post a reward to be given to
      the last matching classifier.  The genetic algorithm is activated at
      the iteration specified by the variable GAPERIOD.  Pairs of
      classifiers are chosen randomly according to their strengths.  Bad
      performing classifiers are replaced according to their similarities
      to the new offsprings.  Data about the population and its parameters
      is recorded in REPORT.OUT at periodic intervals.
