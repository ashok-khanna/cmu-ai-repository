Description: 

   This directory contains Genie, a GA-based modeling/forecasting system.
   Genie is used for long-term planning. One can construct a model of an
   environment and then view the forecasts of how that environment will
   evolve into the future. It is then possible to alter the future
   picture of the environment so as to construct a picture of a desired
   future. The GA is then employed to suggest changes to the existing
   environment so as to cause the desired future to come about.
