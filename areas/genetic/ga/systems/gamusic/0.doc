Summary:      Genetic Algorithm to Evolve Musical Melodies

Version:      1.0 (8-SEP-94)

Description: 

   GAMusic is a user-friendly interactive demonstration of a simple genetic
   algorithm (GA).  Here, the GA generates short melodies and the user
   assigns the fitnesses.  The iterative stepping, mutation frequency and
   recombination frequency are all controlled by the user.  Each series of
   musical notes is represented in binary form in an array 128 elements in
   length.  This allows a maximum of 30 notes per melody and provides a
   solution space with approximately 3.4 * 10^38 possible melodies.

   [Intended as an introduction to GAs; may not be of interest to
   experienced GA programmers.]
