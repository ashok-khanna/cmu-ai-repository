Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/genlib/

Name:         GENlib

Summary:      Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks

Version:      0.1b (29-JUL-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains a library of functions for Genetic
   Algorithms together with two applications of this library to 
   train Neural Networks.

   The first one, called "cosine", uses a genetic algorithm to train a
   simple three layer Feed-Forward network to work as a cosine-function.
   This task is very difficult to train for a Backprop-Algorithm while
   the Genetic Algorithm produces good results.  The second one, called
   "vartop", is developing a Neural Network to perform the XOR-function.
   This is done with two Genetic Algorithms, the first one develops the
   topology of the network, and the second one adjusts the weigths.

Requires:     C

Ports:        Tested on IBM RS/6000 and IBM PCs.
