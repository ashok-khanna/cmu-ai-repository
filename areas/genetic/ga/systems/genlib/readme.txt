Welcome to the wonderful world of Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks!

Here you'll find a library of functions to work with Genetic Algorithms
together with two applications of this library on the field of neural
networks. The first one called "cosine" uses a genetic algorithm to
train a simple three layer Feed-Forward network to work as a
cosine-function. This task is very difficult to train for a
Backprop-Algorithm while the Genetic Algorithm produces good results.
The second one called "vartop" is developing a Neural Network to
perform the XOR-function. This is done with two Genetic Algorithms, the
first one develops the topology of the network, the second one adjusts
the weigths.
