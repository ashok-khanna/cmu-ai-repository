Description: 

   This directory contains Genetic Aided Cascade-Correlation (GACC).

   Genetic algorithms are applied to the optimization of the weights in
   the cascade-correlation learning architecture.  In this architecture,
   the neural network starts out with a layer of output neurons.  The
   output neuron weights are then adjusted to minimize the error in the
   network.  A hidden neuron is then added and its weights adjusted so
   its output correlates with the error in the network. It is then
   connected to the output neurons and the weights of the output neuron
   are once again readjusted.  This process of adding neurons continues
   until a network with an acceptable error is produced.

   Genetic algorithms are used to find the weights for both the hidden
   and output neurons.  We attempt to use the global optimization
   characteristics of genetic algorithms to find the global set of
   weights.  However, while simple genetic algorithms can find the area
   of the weight space where there is a minimum error for the output
   weights or maximum correlation for the hidden layers, they do not
   converge to the actual minimum or maximum.  We must find a way to
   supplement the simple genetic algorithm.

   In our approach, the Genetic aided cascade-correlation, we explore the
   weight space first by using simple genetic algorithms with
   non-overlapping populations and binary encoded weights.  We then use
   Quickprop to converge to the minimum or maximum.  We have applied our
   algorithm to the two spiral test with resulting average network sizes
   of an average of 21.6 hidden nodes.
