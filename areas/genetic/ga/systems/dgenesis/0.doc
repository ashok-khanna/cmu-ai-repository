Name:         DGENESIS

Summary:      Distributed GA 

Version:      1.0 (27-APR-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains DGENESIS.  Based on GENESIS 5.0, it aims to
   implement a distributed GA on a network of workstations. Each
   subpopulation is handled by a UNIX process and communication is via
   UNIX sockets.

   The user can set the migration rate, the migration interval and the
   topology of communication between subpopulations.


Requires:     

Ports:        DGENESIS has been tested on DECstations 5000, microVAX 3100,
              Sun workstations and PCs running 386BSD 0.1. Porting to
              other systems using the Berkeley socket interface should
              be easy.
