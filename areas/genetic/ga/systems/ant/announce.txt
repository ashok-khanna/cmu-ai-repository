Would anybody out there be interested in a PC version of the so-called
'John Muir Trail' experiment?  I have a good program which simulates
trail-following behavior and evolution by natural selection.  A
companion paper describes the work.  It is only necessary to have a PC
with EGA and ANSI.SYS to perform the necessary display functions.

The John Muir Trail experiment itself did not originate with me, but
the code is 100% mine.  (analagous situation : having written a
program to do J.Conway's Life)

The program primarily demonstrates evolution by natural selection.  If
you wish to apply the genetic algorithm to a different problem, it
shouldn't prove hard to tear out the ANT guts and supply your own gene
interpreter.

I have placed the file ANT.ZIP at the site ftp.std.com in the
directory /ftp/pub/pbrennan.  The zipfile contains Turbo C source, an
MSDOS executable, a WordPerfect 5.1 paper, and a PostScript version of
the paper.  To access the ftp site, login as anonymous.

Comments are appreciated!
