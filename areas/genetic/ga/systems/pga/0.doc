Summary:      Parallel Genetic Algorithms Testbed

Version:      2.5 (4-OCT-93)

Description: 

   PGA is a simple testbed for basic explorations in genetic algorithms.
   Command line arguments control a range of parameters, there are a
   number of built-in problems for the GA to solve. The current set
   consists of:

     - maximize the number of bits set in a chromosome

     - De Jong's functions DJ1, DJ2, DJ3, DJ5

     - binary F6, used by Schaffer et al

     - a crude 1-d knapsack problem; you specify a target and a set of
       numbers in an external file, GA tries to find a subset that sums
       as closely as possible to the target

     - the `royal road' function(s); a chromosome is regarded as
       a set of consecutive blocks of size K, and scores K for each
       block entirely filled with 1s

   and it's easy to add your own problems (see below). Chromosomes are
   represented as character arrays, so you are not (quite) stuck with
   bit-string problem encodings.

   PGA allows multiple populations, with periodic migration between
   them, and a range of other options. For example, you can choose
   the chromosome length independently of the choice of problem.
