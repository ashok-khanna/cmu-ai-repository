Subject: FTP now set up for GA-List

	I am pleased to announce that we have finally set up our ftp
	server for the use of GA-List members via anonymous ftp.
	GA-List readers can now access all back issues of GA-List,
	either by individual issue or as a complete set.  Also, other
	informational files are available.  The top level README file
	is reproduced below.

	To use this service, ftp to ftp.aic.nrl.navy.mil using
	"anonymous" as your user name and your email address as your
	password.  Then cd to pub/galist.  Here is an example
        that shows the log on process and a listing of the
        galist directory:

	Etiquette: Please use your email address as your password.
	This will help us to track usage of the facility.  Also, please
	restrict your usage to off-peak hours.  Do NOT use between
	8:00am and 6:00pm EST Monday through Friday.

	Please remember to use binary mode if you plan to grab any
	non-text files, e.g. tar files.

	Here is part of the top-level README file from the pub/galist
	directory:

	  ****************************************
This directory contains various information for the GA-List digest.

In this, the top level directory (pub/galist), you will find the
following:

  	            README - This file.

		       FTP - This is a mail message that was sent out on
			     ga-list digests that describes how to
			     ftp to this site and get information 
			     from the pub/galist directory.

	digests-vNnM.tar.Z - A compressed tar file of all ga-list digests
			     from v1n1 to vNnM where N is the volume
			     and M is the number.

	           digests - This is a directory that contains the INDEX
			     and all individual issues.  Issues are each
			     contained in a file with a name in the form
			     vNnM, as explained above.  The file INDEX
			     contains a table of contents for all issues.

	       information - This directory contains various informational
			     files and directories:

  information/publications - This is a list of the more common books,
			     journals and conference proceedings on
			     Genetic Algorithms.

   information/conferences - This directory contains the text of
			     GA-related conference CFPs and announcements.

	       source-code - This directory contains various source code
			     as follows:

       source-code/digests - This directory contains source code fragments
			     that were sent as submissions to ga-list, but
			     were too large to be put into the digest.
			     The ga-list issue will then contain an
			     editors note pointing readers to the proper
			     file in this directory.  Names should be
			     obvious; e.g. the file "v6n5-greycode"
			     contains code from an article on grey codes
			     that appeared in v6n5 of ga-list.

     source-code/ga-source - This directory will archive Genetic
			     Algorithm source code. Please contact me to
			     arrange submission of code.

	  ****************************************

	Enjoy the service, and send any suggestions to the usual place:
	ga-list-request@aic.nrl.navy.mil.
