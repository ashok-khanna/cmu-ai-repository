Summary:      Functions for parsing data files in the CMU Learning Benchmark

Version:      1.0.4 (20-FEB-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains two functions for the parsing of data files in
   the CMU Learning Benchmark format.  Given the name of the data file,
   information on how to deal with enumerations, and a data structure,
   the parse procedure will build the data structure and fill it with
   information on how to build the network.  A function is also provided
   to destroy this data structure.
