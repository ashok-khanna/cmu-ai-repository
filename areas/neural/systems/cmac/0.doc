Summary:      Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller

Version:      15-SEP-93

Description: 

   CMAC implements the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC), a
   neural network architecture proposed by J.S. Albus. This network is
   applied to two of the example problems that accompany the MATLAB
   Neural Network Toolbox, BCKPROP4 and CSTRAIN. These simple function
   approximation examples illustrate some of the features of CMAC.
