Package:      areas/neural/systems/utexas/fgrep/

Name:         FGREP

Summary:      Distributed representations for words in the case-role
              assignment task.

Version:      3-OCT-91

Description: 

   This package contains the code and data for nonrecurrent FGREP
   simulation in the case-role assignment task, i.e. in mapping sentence
   constituents into case roles, simultaneously developing distributed
   representations for the words.

Requires:     C
