Summary:      Connectionist Network Optimization Package

Version:      2.0 (8-OCT-90)

Description: 

   GRADSIM is a connectionist network optimization package, a neural
   network simulator that supports recurrent time-delay network
   optimization.  GRADSIM was designed for simulation experiments with
   the temporal flow model and was developed for research in speech
   recognition. The temporal flow model is characterized by delay links
   and unrestricted network connectivity.  The simulator accepts network
   descriptors and experiment descriptors in a very simple format, and
   efficiently computes the complete gradient of recurrent networks. It
   can be configured for several gradient descent methods.
