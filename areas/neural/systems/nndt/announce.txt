Version 0.98b of
 
             NNDT
 A Neural Network Tool for Windows

is available at  ftp.cica.indiana.edu 
in the file      pub/pc/win3/demo/nndt098b.zip

NNDT is a tool for neural network development which runs under 
MS Windows 3.1. The program includes models for multilayer feed-forward
and recurrent networks and routines for graphical presentation of the
results. Network training is carried out by the Levenberg-Marquardt 
method. The program is easy to use; all parameters are presented in setup 
windows and on-line help is available. The user-interface is developed 
with Microsoft Visual Basic while the network calculations and the 
training method are implemented in C and compiled to dynamic-link 
library (DLL) routines.
