Package:      areas/neural/systems/som_lvq/

Name:         LVQ_PAK and SOM_PAK

Summary:      Classification of data using self-organizing memory networks.

Version:      LVQ_PAK 2.1 (9-OCT-91); SOM_PAK 1.2 (2-NOV-92)

Description: 

   LVQ_PAK (Learning Vector Quantization) and SOM_PAK (Self-Organizing Maps)
   are programs for classification of data using self-organizing
   memory networks. SOM is better suited to visualization of
   complex data; LVQ is more appropriate for classification tasks.

   Also included is a comprehensive BibTeX/PostScript bibliography of
   Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps and Learning Vector Quantization, with
   more than 1,000 entries, and the Xvisual program which is used with
   SOM_PAK. 

Requires:     UNIX, MS-DOS
