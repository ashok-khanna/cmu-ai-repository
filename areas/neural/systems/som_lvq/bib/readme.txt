Hello,

We are in the process of compiling the complete bibliography
of works on Kohonen Self-Organizing Map and Learning Vector
Quantization all over the world. Currently the bibliography
contains more than 1000 entries. The bibliography is now
available (in BibTeX and PostScript formats) by anonymous FTP from:

cochlea.hut.fi:/pub/ref/references.bib.Z  ( BibTeX file)
cochlea.hut.fi:/pub/ref/references.ps.Z   ( PostScript file)

The above files are compressed. Please make sure you use "binary" mode
when you transfer these files.

Please send any additions and corrections to :

     biblio@cochlea.hut.fi
Please follow the IEEE instructions of references (full names of
authors, name of article, journal name, volume + number where applicable,
first and last page number, year, etc.) and BibTeX-format, if possible.

Yours,
