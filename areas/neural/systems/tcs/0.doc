Summary:      Tasmanian Connectionist Simulator

Version:      4-AUG-93

Description: 

   TCS (Tasmanian Connectionist Simulator) is a neural network
   simulation package written in Borland C++ for MS Windows.

   Examples include an interactive activation network for 4-letter words,
   the Rescorla-Wagner model of classical conditioning, Schnys's
   Clustering Network (uses a non-supervised Kohonen-style learning
   rule), and an XOR network using backpropagation.

Requires:     C++, Microsoft Windows
