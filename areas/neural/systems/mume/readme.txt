The files MUME-0.5-DOS.tar.Z and MUME-0.5-DOS.zip contain the compressed
tar and the zip of the same release of MUME (0.5 for DOS). The tar file
was created using the standard tar command (on a sun station). The zip
file was created using zip version 1.9. Here is an extract of its man
page:

     zip version 1.9 is compatible with pkzip 1.93a.   Note  that
     pkunzip 1.10 cannot extract files produced by pkzip 1.93a or
     zip 1.9. You must use pkunzip 1.93a or unzip 5.0 to  extract
     them.

If you have problems with the procedure of unpacking the release, please
send email to mume-bugs@sedal.su.oz.au.

Have fun!
