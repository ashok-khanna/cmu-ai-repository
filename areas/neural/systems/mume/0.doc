Name:         MUME

Summary:      Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment

Version:      0.5

Description: 

   MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
   environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
   oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
   with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
   oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
   and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
   architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
   continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
   supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
   weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
   can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
   support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
   and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
   non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. 

   MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
   University Electrical Engineering. 

Requires:     C.

Ports:        Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to
              port it to the Fujitsu VP2200 vector processor using the VCC
              vectorizing C compiler, HP 9000/700, SGI workstations, DEC
              Alphas, and PC DOS (with DJGCC).
