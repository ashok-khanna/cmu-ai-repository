You may fetch our PC-based BP simulater, called BackProp 1.4

It's a mouse driven program which lets you design your nets in an
intuitive, graphical way. This limits it's use to nets of a smaller
size (<25), but it'll do for learning purpose.

It's implemeting some different BP-rules, including CG. It works for
any feedforward structured nets, which must not be ordered in layers.

The program comes with no printed doc, but is equipped with a context
sensitive help facility. A VGA-card is recommended, EGA will do also.

You can find it on
	nick-2.neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de is 141.51.188.3,
Aliases:   ftp.neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de
in
	/pub/NeuralNets/BackProp-1.4
where you find a LHA packed file. If you don't have LHA to unpack it,
you'll find a LHA-package also on our server.

The program runs on machines with and without a numerical coprozessor (x87).
For now only a binary is avaible, maybe we'll distribute the NN-part of
the prgram as PASCAL-source in the future.

** Since we have a large wold-map in our office where we collect **
** all the sites where people use our BackProp, please send us a **
** postcard so that we can put some more needles in the map.     **
