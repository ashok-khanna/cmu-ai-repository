Neuronc is a general-purpose computer language somewhat
like C that has special features for simulating large neural 
circuits using compartments.  It allows creating large arrays and
uses an iterative difference equation solver so that virtually
any network geometry may be specified (e.g. geometry is not
limited to "tree" structure, and may include loops).

Since NeuronC is primarily a language it does not contain a
complete interactive pull-down menu system for describing and
running a simulation.  However, there is a complete graphics
facility for displaying on standard devices such as X11,
PostScript, and VGA.  NeuronC also produces ray-traced 
scenes for rendering with the POVRAY simulator.

The "NeuronC" simulator was originally designed for vision
experiments on large neural circuits. It includes a 2D light stimulus
(with optical blur and photon noise) and photoreceptor models complete
with spectral sensitivities and time-responses.  A flexible set of
synapse and membrane channel models is also included, including HH,
sequential-state, and calcium-dependent versions.  Any network
geometry can be simulated (including electrical loops) and a virtually
unlimited number of voltage- clamp/current clamp and recording sites
may be specified and plotted.
