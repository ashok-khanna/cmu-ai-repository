    SNNS2C (SNNS networkfile to C converter) Version 1.0 available
**********************************************************************

SNNS2C  is a tool to convert the description of a neural network  from
SNNS  (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator)  format  to C source  code.
This code can then be linked to an existing program as a subroutine.

The usage of snns2c requires several steps:

First  the executable snns2c  has to  be generated. This can simply be
done  by  using the  supplied  makefile.  Perhaps  some  configuration
settings have to be changed in the makefile first (CC = ??).

The  next step  is  to  create  the files  runtime.c and  runtime.h by
executing snns2c.  The names  of the files can be changed by using the
option -o.  For the usage of snns2c see snns2c.man.   To create  these
runtime-files, you need a network description file generated by SNNS.

When you have the files runtime.c and runtime.h you can write your own
program using the functions exported  by runtime.c (see runtime.h  and
runtime.man).  Finally you have  to  link your program  and  runtime.o
together.

			       Example
**********************************************************************

This distribution includes an example. Propagate.c is a simple program
that reads some patterns from a pattern file,  propagates them through
the net and saves the output in a result file.

Making and executing the example includes the following steps:

	make               :      creates snns2c

        make example       :      uses xors.net to create runtime.c 
                                  and runtime.h
                                  compiles runtime.c, propagate_1.c,
                                  and propagate_2.c and creates
                                  propagate_1 and propagate_2

        propagate_1        :      creates xors.res
	propagate_2        :      interactive propagation of xors.net

Please have a  look at propagate_1.c and  propagate_2.c to learn about
how to use  the supported library  functions of runtime.c. Please also
read the manual pages snns2c.man and runtime.man.




**********************************************************************
		    ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION 
**********************************************************************

snns2c is  not  a part of the official  SNNS  distribution.  Currently
snns2c represents the version 2.1 of SNNS. All features implemented in
later versions (e.g. version 3.0) are not yet supported by snns2c.




**********************************************************************
		    SNNS2C licensing terms (short)
**********************************************************************

snns2c is available NOW, free of  charge for research purposes under a
GNU-style copyright agreement. See the license  agreement in the  user
manual  and  in  the file Readme.license of the  SNNS distribution for
details.

snns2c is (C)  Copyright  University of Stuttgart, IPVR. SNNS  also is
(C) Copyright University of Stuttgart, IPVR.

snns2c can  only be obtained by  anonymous ftp over the Internet.  See
the detailed description of how to obtain snns2c below. We don't  have
the time and capacity to send tapes or floppy disks, so don't ask. You
may,  however, obtain the unmodified snns2c  distribution  from  other
sites which already have  obtained it,  under the terms of our license
agreement, if you are unable to connect to our machine.



**********************************************************************
			 How to obtain SNNS2C
**********************************************************************

The snns2c can be obtained via anonymous ftp from host

        ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de  (129.69.211.2)

in the subdirectory        /pub/SNNS
as file
	SNNS2Cv2.1.tar.Z

Be sure to  set the  ftp mode  to  binary before  transmission of  the
files.  Also watch out for possible higher version numbers, patches or
Readme  files  in  the  above directory  /pub/SNNS.  After  successful
transmission of the file  move it  to the directory where you want  to
install snns2c, uncompress and extract the file with the Unix commands

        uncompress SNNS2Cv2.1.tar.Z	
        tar -xvf SNNS2Cv2.1.tar

Create snns2c and the example programs like described above.

		     Questions, bugs, patches ...
**********************************************************************

Note that snns2c has not been tested extensively in different computer
environments and is a research tool with frequent substantial changes.
It should be obvious that WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANYTHING.

We are also not staffed to answer problems  with snns2c or to fix bugs
quickly. We do, however, try to help you as far as we can.

For questions, comments, bug reports, or posting of patches concerning
SNNS or snns2c we refer you  to the  SNNS  mailing list. To subscribe,
send a mail to
  
	listserv@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de

With the one line message (in the mail body, not in the subject)

	subscribe snns <your full name>


As of now, snns2c is no official part of the SNNS distribution. We are
working  on  SNNS  and  if we see enough interest  in  snns2c we  will
incorporate  it  in  the  next distribution of SNNS.
