XPP is a system for the analysis and simulation of dynamic and
probabilistic phenomena.  It solves differential equations, difference
equations, delay equations, functional equations, iterative equations,
boundary value problems, and stochastic equations, all combined with
probabilistic models.  It evolved from a chapter written by Bard
Ermentrout and John Rinzel on the qualitative theory of nerve
membranes and eventually became a commercial product for MSDOS
computers called PHASEPLANE.  It is now available for free as a
program running under X11 and UNIX.

A variety of numerical methods are employed so that the user
can generally be sure that the solutions are accurate.  Examples include
connectionist type neural nets, biophysical models, models with memory,
and models of cells with random inputs or with random transitions.  

A graphical interface using X Windows as well as numerous plotting
options are provided. PostScript output is supported.
