Summary:      Implementations of ART-1 and ART-2 Neural Networks

Description:

   This directory contains several implementations of ART1 and ART2
   Neural Networks. Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks, as
   proposed by Carpenter and Grossberg, form clusters and are trained
   without supervision.
