Summary:      Simulation of ART-2 Neural Networks

Version:      2-JUL-92

Description: 

   This directory contains two implementations of ART-2 Neural
   Networks. They were written by students of Stephen Grossberg in a
   programming laboratory (CN550). The file gaudiano.tgz contains what
   seems to be a more up to date version of the implementation included
   in art2.tgz.

   Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks, as proposed by Carpenter
   and Grossberg, form clusters and are trained without supervision.
