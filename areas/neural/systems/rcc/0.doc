Name:         RCC

Summary:      Recurrent Cascade-Correlation Learning Algorithm in Lisp and C

Version:      Lisp 1.0 (10-OCT-91); C 2.0 (7-OCT-91)

Description: 

   This directory contains Lisp and C implementations of the recurrent
   cascade-correlation learning algorithm. The original Lisp version was
   written by Scott Fahlman. It was then ported to C by Scott Crowder.
   This directory contains the C version modified by Conor Doherty.

Requires:     Lisp, C

Ports:        

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/connect/code/
              as the files rcc1.lisp and rcc1.c
