Package:      areas/neural/systems/cascor/

Name:         CASCOR

Summary:      Lisp and C implementations of Cascade Correlation

Version:      C 1.1 (31-MAY-94); Lisp 1.0 ()

Description: 

   This directory contains C and Lisp implementations of the Cascade
   Correlation Algorithm. 

   The Lisp code was written by Scott Fahlman, then ported to C by
   Scott Crowder. More recent C versions have been re-engineered by Matt
   White.  Features have been added to allow data sets from the CMU
   learning benchmark database to run on this system.

Requires:     C, Lisp

Ports:        

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/connect/code/
              as the files cascor-v1.1.shar and cascor1.lisp
              and in /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/connect/tr/ as cascor-tr.ps.Z
