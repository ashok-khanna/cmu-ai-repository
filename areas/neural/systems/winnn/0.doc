Summary:      Windows Neural Networks

Version:      0.9.3 (18-MAY-94)

Description: 

   WinNN is a neural networks package for windows 3.1. WinNN incorporates
   a friendly user interface with a powerful computational engine. WinNN
   can implement feed forward multi-layered neural nets and uses a modified
   back-propagation algorithm for training. WinNN was written in
   Visual Basic 3.0. (Source code isn't included.)
