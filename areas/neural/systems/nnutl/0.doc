Summary:      C source library/tutorial for neural networks

Version:      1.01 (2-AUG-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains a tutorial/source code library for writing
   and understanding C implementations of neural networks.
   It includes implementations of XOR, feedforward networks with
   backpropagation as the learning algorithm, competitive learning
   networks with a Hebbian Learning algorithm, and recurrent networks
   with backpropagation.
