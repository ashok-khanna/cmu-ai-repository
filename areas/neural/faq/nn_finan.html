    Summary: Using artificial intelligence to improve real-world performance.
             Editors: Robert R. Trippi, Efraim Turban.
             Chicago, Ill., Probus, 1992

2.  From an advertisement in 'PC AI' magazine.

    Title:   Forecasting With Neural Networks
    Price:   $12.50 (US).
    Summary: The interesting bit is that the detailed example in 
             the paper is a "how to" on using neural networks to
             predict commodity prices.  It is really quite good.

3.  Fortune Sept. 93. 
    An article about Neural Netwirks had clips on financial management.
    Look at the picture, you can tell what software they used.


4.  Title:   NEUROVE$T JOURNAL

    Summary: The magazine covers "the waterfront" on financial markets from the
             trader's view and focuses only on market trading.  As it strives
             to appeal to a broad audience, the articles tend to be short and 
             introductory, but the magazine does introduce all the hot topics. 
    Note:    This may be a BONUS issue which are only available to subscribers.
             It is usally found at the "better" book stores.  The bonus issues
             contain abstracts and idexes to all of the articles.

MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------
1.  I'm near-real-time testing a NN solution for predicting SPX (SP 500 Index
    Options).  Took months to generate usable preprocessing rules for training
    data (selecting applicable features, manipulations for averaging, scaling,
    etc.), days (hours) to train Back Propagation network.  Currently, I am
    loading each day's closing data and testing to see if the NN can predict
    the future - then checking to see if it was right at the end of the
    prediction period.  If it works, I'll happily publish my methods and
    results after I retire.  If it dosen't, I'll go ahead and post them in the
    next few months.  At least you'll be able to eliminate one method.

    Mark Jurik (I think I've seen some of his posts in this group) gives as
    good a description of the mechanics of selecting and preprocessing data as
    any I've seen, but you'd better be your own domain expert and select your
    own features - not use the ones he uses in his example.

    Also, Jurik's basic article is in the Appendix to the User Manual of
    BrainCel - a simple, easy NN package that's a DLL for Microsoft Excel on a
    Windows 3.1 PC.  I found Braincel a cheap way to get started before
    spending a lot of time coding my own NN algorithms (or spending a major
    chunk of my risk capital on one of the more elegant packages like
    BrainMaker) - they had a $99.95 special going at one time.  Manufacturer is
    Promised Land Technologies - they advertise in 'AI Expert' and 'Stocks & 
    Commodities' magazines.  Might also subscribe to Neurove$t Journal - I've 
    seen one issue and it had some hints.  Also advertised in 'Stocks & 
    Commodities'.
