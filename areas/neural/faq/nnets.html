========== Answers ========== 
******************************

 1. A: What is this newsgroup for? How shall it be used?
 =======================================================

   The newsgroup comp.ai.neural-nets is inteded as a forum for people who want
   to use or explore the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks or
   Neural-Network-like structures.

   There should be the following types of articles in this newsgroup:

    1. Requests
    +++++++++++

      Requests are articles of the form "I am looking for X" where
      X is something public like a book, an article, a piece of software. The
      most important about such a request is to be as specific as possible!

      If multiple different answers can be expected, the person making the
      request should prepare to make a summary of the answers he/she got
      and announce to do so with a phrase like "Please reply by
      email, I'll summarize to the group" at the end of the
      posting.

      The Subject line of the posting should then be something like 
      "Request: X" 

    2. Questions
    ++++++++++++

      As opposed to requests, questions ask for a larger piece of information
      or a more or less detailed explanation of something. To avoid lots of
      redundant traffic it is important that the poster provides with the
      question all information s/he already has about the subject asked and
      state the actual question as precise and narrow as possible. The poster
      should prepare to make a summary of the answers s/he got and
      announce to do so with a phrase like "Please reply by
      email, I'll summarize to the group" at the end of the
      posting.

      The Subject line of the posting should be something like 
      "Question: this-and-that" or have the form of a question
      (i.e., end with a question mark) 

    3. Answers
    ++++++++++

      These are reactions to questions or requests. As a rule of thumb articles
      of type "answer" should be rare. Ideally, in most cases either the
      answer is too specific to be of general interest (and should thus be
      e-mailed to the poster) or a summary was announced with the question
      or request (and answers should thus be e-mailed to the poster).

      The subject lines of answers are automatically adjusted by the news
      software. Note that sometimes longer threads of discussion evolve
      from an answer to a question or request. In this case posters should
      change the subject line suitably as soon as the topic goes too far away
      from the one announced in the original subject line. You can still carry
      along the old subject in parentheses in the form "Subject: new
      subject (was: old subject)" 

    4. Summaries
    ++++++++++++

      In all cases of requests or questions the answers for which can be
      assumed to be of some general interest, the poster of the request or
      question shall summarize the answers he/she received. Such a summary
      should be announced in the original posting of the question or request
      with a phrase like "Please answer by email, I'll
      summarize"

      In such a case, people who answer to a question should NOT post their
      answer to the newsgroup but instead mail them to the poster of the
      question who collects and reviews them. After about 5 to 20 days after
      the original posting, its poster should make the summary of answers
      and post it to the newsgroup.

      Some care should be invested into a summary: 
       o simple concatenation of all the answers is not enough: instead,
         redundancies, irrelevancies, verbosities, and errors should be
         filtered out (as good as possible) 
       o the answers should be separated clearly 
       o the contributors of the individual answers should be identifiable
         (unless they requested to remain anonymous [yes, that happens])
       o the summary should start with the "quintessence" of the
         answers, as seen by the original poster 
       o A summary should, when posted, clearly be indicated to be one
         by giving it a Subject line starting with "SUMMARY:" 
      Note that a good summary is pure gold for the rest of the newsgroup
      community, so summary work will be most appreciated by all of us.
      Good summaries are more valuable than any moderator ! :-) 

    5. Announcements
    ++++++++++++++++

      Some articles never need any public reaction. These are called
      announcements (for instance for a workshop, conference or the
      availability of some technical report or software system).

      Announcements should be clearly indicated to be such by giving them a
      subject line of the form "Announcement: this-and-that" 

    6. Reports
    ++++++++++

      Sometimes people spontaneously want to report something to the
      newsgroup. This might be special experiences with some software,
      results of own experiments or conceptual work, or especially
      interesting information from somewhere else.

      Reports should be clearly indicated to be such by giving them a subject
      line of the form "Report: this-and-that" 

    7. Discussions
    ++++++++++++++

      An especially valuable possibility of Usenet is of course that of
      discussing a certain topic with hundreds of potential participants. All
      traffic in the newsgroup that can not be subsumed under one of the
      above categories should belong to a discussion.

      If somebody explicitly wants to start a discussion, he/she can do so by
      giving the posting a subject line of the form "Subject:
      Discussion: this-and-that"

      It is quite difficult to keep a discussion from drifting into chaos, but,
      unfortunately, as many many other newsgroups show there seems to be
      no secure way to avoid this. On the other hand, comp.ai.neural-nets has
      not had many problems with this effect in the past, so let's just go and
      hope... 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. A: What is a neural network (NN)?
 ====================================

   First of all, when we are talking about a neural network, we *should* usually
   better say "artificial neural network" (ANN), because that is what we mean
   most of the time. Biological neural networks are much more complicated in
   their elementary structures than the mathematical models we use for ANNs.

   A vague description is as follows:

   An ANN is a network of many very simple processors ("units"), each possibly
   having a (small amount of) local memory. The units are connected by
   unidirectional communication channels ("connections"), which carry numeric
   (as opposed to symbolic) data. The units operate only on their local data and on
   the inputs they receive via the connections.

   The design motivation is what distinguishes neural networks from other
   mathematical techniques:

   A neural network is a processing device, either an algorithm, or actual
   hardware, whose design was motivated by the design and functioning of
   human brains and components thereof.

   Most neural networks have some sort of "training" rule whereby the weights
   of connections are adjusted on the basis of presented patterns. In other words,
   neural networks "learn" from examples, just like children learn to recognize
   dogs from examples of dogs, and exhibit some structural capability for
   generalization.

   Neural networks normally have great potential for parallelism, since the
   computations of the components are independent of each other. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. A: What can you do with a Neural Network and what not?
 =========================================================

   In principle, NNs can compute any computable function, i.e. they can do
   everything a normal digital computer can do. Especially anything that can be
   represented as a mapping between vector spaces can be approximated to
   arbitrary precision by feedforward NNs (which is the most often used type).

   In practice, NNs are especially useful for mapping problems which are
   tolerant of some errors, have lots of example data available, but to which hard
   and fast rules can not easily be applied. NNs are, at least today, difficult to
   apply successfully to problems that concern manipulation of symbols and
   memory. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. A: Who is concerned with Neural Networks?
 ============================================

   Neural Networks are interesting for quite a lot of very dissimilar people: 
    o Computer scientists want to find out about the properties of
      non-symbolic information processing with neural nets and about
      learning systems in general. 
    o Engineers of many kinds want to exploit the capabilities of neural
      networks on many areas (e.g. signal processing) to solve their
      application problems. 
    o Cognitive scientists view neural networks as a possible apparatus to
      describe models of thinking and conscience (High-level brain
      function). 
    o Neuro-physiologists use neural networks to describe and explore
      medium-level brain function (e.g. memory, sensory system, motorics). 
    o Physicists use neural networks to model phenomena in statistical
      mechanics and for a lot of other tasks. 
    o Biologists use Neural Networks to interpret nucleotide sequences. 
    o Philosophers and some other people may also be interested in Neural
      Networks for various reasons. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5. A: What does 'backprop' mean? What is 'overfitting'? 
 ========================================================

   'Backprop' is an abbreviation for 'backpropagation of error' which is the most
   widely used learning method for neural networks today. Although it has many
   disadvantages, which could be summarized in the sentence "You are almost
   not knowing what you are actually doing when using backpropagation" :-) it
   has pretty much success on practical applications and is relatively easy to
   apply.

   It is for the training of layered (i.e., nodes are grouped in layers) feedforward
   (i.e., the arcs joining nodes are unidirectional, and there are no cycles) nets
   (often called "multi layer perceptrons").

   Back-propagation needs a teacher that knows the correct output for any input
   ("supervised learning") and uses gradient descent on the error (as provided by
   the teacher) to train the weights. The activation function is (usually) a
   sigmoidal (i.e., bounded above and below, but differentiable) function of a
   weighted sum of the nodes inputs.

   The use of a gradient descent algorithm to train its weights makes it slow to
   train; but being a feedforward algorithm, it is quite rapid during the recall
   phase.

   Literature:
      Rumelhart, D. E. and McClelland, J. L. (1986): Parallel Distributed
      Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition (volume 1,
      pp 318-362). The MIT Press. 

   (this is the classic one) or one of the dozens of other books or articles on
   backpropagation (see also answer "books").

   'Overfitting' (often also called 'overtraining' or 'overlearning') is the
   phenomenon that in most cases a network gets worse instead of better after a
   certain point during training when it is trained to as low errors as possible.
   This is because such long training may make the network 'memorize' the
   training patterns, including all of their peculiarities. However, one is usually
   interested in the generalization of the network, i.e., the error it exhibits on
   examples NOT seen during training. Learning the peculiarities of the training
   set makes the generalization worse. The network should only learn the general
   structure of the examples. 

   There are various methods to fight overfitting. The two most important classes
   of such methods are regularization methods (such as weight decay) and early
   stopping. Regularization methods try to limit the complexity of the network
   such that it is unable to learn peculiarities. Early stopping aims at stopping the
   training at the point of optimal generalization. A description of the early
   stopping method can for instance be found in section 3.3 of 
   /pub/papers/techreports/1994-21.ps.Z on ftp.ira.uka.de (anonymous ftp). 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6. A: Why use a bias input? Why activation functions? 
 ======================================================

   One way of looking at the need for bias inputs is that the inputs to each unit in
   the net define an N-dimensional space, and the unit draws a hyperplane
   through that space, producing an "on" output on one side and an "off" output
   on the other. (With sigmoid units the plane will not be sharp -- there will be
   some gray area of intermediate values near the separating plane -- but ignore
   this for now.)
   The weights determine where this hyperplane is in the input space. Without a
   bias input, this separating plane is constrained to pass through the origin of the
   hyperspace defined by the inputs. For some problems that's OK, but in many
   problems the plane would be much more useful somewhere else. If you have
   many units in a layer, they share the same input space and without bias would
   ALL be constrained to pass through the origin. 

   Activation functions are needed to introduce nonlinearity into the network.
   Without nonlinearity, hidden units would not make nets more powerful than
   just plain perceptrons (which do not have any hidden units, just input and
   output units). The reason is that a composition of linear functions is again a
   linear function. However, it is just the nonlinearity (i.e, the capability to
   represent nonlinear functions) that makes multilayer networks so powerful.
   Almost any nonlinear function does the job, although for backpropagation
   learning it must be differentiable and it helps if the function is bounded; the
   popular sigmoidal functions and gaussian functions are the most common
   choices.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7. A: How many hidden units should I use? 
 ==========================================

   There is no way to determine a good network topology just from the number
   of inputs and outputs. It depends critically on the number of training examples
   and the complexity of the classification you are trying to learn. There are
   problems with one input and one output that require millions of hidden units,
   and problems with a million inputs and a million outputs that require only one
   hidden unit, or none at all.
   Some books and articles offer "rules of thumb" for choosing a topopology --
   Ninputs plus Noutputs dividied by two, maybe with a square root in there
   somewhere -- but such rules are total garbage. Other rules relate to the
   number of examples available: Use at most so many hidden units that the
   number of weights in the network times 10 is smaller than the number of
   examples. Such rules are only concerned with overfitting and are unreliable as
   well. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8. A: How many learning methods for NNs exist? Which?
 =====================================================

   There are many many learning methods for NNs by now. Nobody knows
   exactly how many. New ones (at least variations of existing ones) are invented
   every week. Below is a collection of some of the most well known methods;
   not claiming to be complete.

   The main categorization of these methods is the distinction of supervised from
   unsupervised learning:

   In supervised learning, there is a "teacher" who in the learning phase "tells"
   the net how well it performs ("reinforcement learning") or what the correct
   behavior would have been ("fully supervised learning").

   In unsupervised learning the net is autonomous: it just looks at the data it is
   presented with, finds out about some of the properties of the data set and
   learns to reflect these properties in its output. What exactly these properties
   are, that the network can learn to recognise, depends on the particular network
   model and learning method.

   Many of these learning methods are closely connected with a certain (class of)
   network topology.

   Now here is the list, just giving some names:

           m). Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9. A: What about Genetic Algorithms?
 ====================================

   There are a number of definitions of GA (Genetic Algorithm). A possible one
   is

     A GA is an optimization program
     that starts with 
     a population of encoded procedures,       (Creation of Life :-> )
     mutates them stochastically,              (Get cancer or so :-> )
     and uses a selection process              (Darwinism)
     to prefer the mutants with high fitness
     and perhaps a recombination process       (Make babies :-> )
     to combine properties of (preferably) the succesful mutants.

   Genetic Algorithms are just a special case of the more general idea of
   ``evolutionary computation''. There is a newsgroup that is dedicated to the
   field of evolutionary computation called comp.ai.genetic. It has a detailed
   FAQ posting which, for instance, explains the terms "Genetic Algorithm",
   "Evolutionary Programming", "Evolution Strategy", "Classifier System", and
   "Genetic Programming". That FAQ also contains lots of pointers to relevant
   literature, software, other sources of information, et cetera et cetera. Please see
   the comp.ai.genetic FAQ for further information. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10. A: What about Fuzzy Logic?
 ==============================

   Fuzzy Logic is an area of research based on the work of L.A. Zadeh. It is a
   departure from classical two-valued sets and logic, that uses "soft" linguistic
   (e.g. large, hot, tall) system variables and a continuous range of truth values in
   the interval [0,1], rather than strict binary (True or False) decisions and
   assignments.

   Fuzzy logic is used where a system is difficult to model exactly (but an inexact
   model is available), is controlled by a human operator or expert, or where
   ambiguity or vagueness is common. A typical fuzzy system consists of a rule
   base, membership functions, and an inference procedure.

   Most Fuzzy Logic discussion takes place in the newsgroup comp.ai.fuzzy, but
   there is also some work (and discussion) about combining fuzzy logic with
   Neural Network approaches in comp.ai.neural-nets.

   For more details see (for example): 

   Klir, G.J. and Folger, T.A.: Fuzzy Sets, Uncertainty, and Information
   Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1988. 
   Kosko, B.: Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems Prentice Hall, Englewood
   Cliffs, NJ, 1992. 

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11. A: How are NNs related to statistical methods? 
 ===================================================

   There is considerable overlap between the fields of neural networks and
   statistics.
   Statistics is concerned with data analysis. In neural network terminology,
   statistical inference means learning to generalize from noisy data. Some neural
   networks are not concerned with data analysis (e.g., those intended to model
   biological systems) and therefore have little to do with statistics. Some neural
   networks do not learn (e.g., Hopfield nets) and therefore have little to do with
   statistics. Some neural networks can learn successfully only from noise-free
   data (e.g., ART or the perceptron rule) and therefore would not be considered
   statistical methods. But most neural networks that can learn to generalize
   effectively from noisy data are similar or identical to statistical methods. For
   example: 
    o Feedforward nets with no hidden layer (including functional-link
      neural nets and higher-order neural nets) are basically generalized
      linear models. 
    o Feedforward nets with one hidden layer are closely related to
      projection pursuit regression. 
    o Probabilistic neural nets are identical to kernel discriminant analysis. 
    o Kohonen nets for adaptive vector quantization are very similar to
      k-means cluster analysis. 
    o Hebbian learning is closely related to principal component analysis. 
   Some neural network areas that appear to have no close relatives in the
   existing statistical literature are: 
    o Kohonen's self-organizing maps. 
    o Reinforcement learning. 
    o Stopped training (the purpose and effect of stopped training are similar
      to shrinkage estimation, but the method is quite different). 
   Feedforward nets are a subset of the class of nonlinear regression and
   discrimination models. Statisticians have studied the properties of this general
   class but had not considered the specific case of feedforward neural nets before
   such networks were popularized in the neural network field. Still, many
   results from the statistical theory of nonlinear models apply directly to
   feedforward nets, and the methods that are commonly used for fitting
   nonlinear models, such as various Levenberg-Marquardt and conjugate
   gradient algorithms, can be used to train feedforward nets. 

   While neural nets are often defined in terms of their algorithms or
   implementations, statistical methods are usually defined in terms of their
   results. The arithmetic mean, for example, can be computed by a (very simple)
   backprop net, by applying the usual formula SUM(x_i)/n, or by various other
   methods. What you get is still an arithmetic mean regardless of how you
   compute it. So a statistician would consider standard backprop, Quickprop,
   and Levenberg-Marquardt as different algorithms for implementing the same
   statistical model such as a feedforward net. On the other hand, different
   training criteria, such as least squares and cross entropy, are viewed by
   statisticians as fundamentally different estimation methods with different
   statistical properties. 

   It is sometimes claimed that neural networks, unlike statistical models, require
   no distributional assumptions. In fact, neural networks involve exactly the
   same sort of distributional assumptions as statistical models, but statisticians
   study the consequences and importance of these assumptions while most neural
   networkers ignore them. For example, least-squares training methods are
   widely used by statisticians and neural networkers. Statisticians realize that
   least-squares training involves implicit distributional assumptions in that
   least-squares estimates have certain optimality properties for noise that is
   normally distributed with equal variance for all training cases and that is
   independent between different cases. These optimality properties are
   consequences of the fact that least-squares estimation is maximum likelihood
   under those conditions. Similarly, cross-entropy is maximum likelihood for
   noise with a Bernoulli distribution. If you study the distributional
   assumptions, then you can recognize and deal with violations of the
   assumptions. For example, if you have normally distributed noise but some
   training cases have greater noise variance than others, then you may be able to
   use weighted least squares instead of ordinary least squares to obtain more
   efficient estimates.

 12. A: Good introductory literature about Neural Networks?
 ==========================================================

   0.) The best (subjectively, of course -- please don't flame me):
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Haykin, S. (1994). Neural Networks, a Comprehensive Foundation.
   Macmillan, New York, NY. "A very readable, well written intermediate to
   advanced text on NNs Perspective is primarily one of pattern recognition,
   estimation and signal processing. However, there are well-written chapters on
   neurodynamics and VLSI implementation. Though there is emphasis on
   formal mathematical models of NNs as universal approximators, statistical
   estimators, etc., there are also examples of NNs used in practical applications.
   The problem sets at the end of each chapter nicely complement the material. In
   the bibliography are over 1000 references. If one buys only one book on neural
   networks, this should be it."

   Hertz, J., Krogh, A., and Palmer, R. (1991). Introduction to the Theory of
   Neural Computation. Addison-Wesley: Redwood City, California. ISBN
   0-201-50395-6 (hardbound) and 0-201-51560-1 (paperbound) Comments:
   "My first impression is that this one is by far the best book on the topic. And
   it's below $30 for the paperback."; "Well written, theoretical (but not
   overwhelming)"; It provides a good balance of model development,
   computational algorithms, and applications. The mathematical derivations are
   especially well done"; "Nice mathematical analysis on the mechanism of
   different learning algorithms"; "It is NOT for mathematical beginner. If you
   don't have a good grasp of higher level math, this book can be really tough to
   get through."

   Masters,Timothy (1994). Practical Neural Network Recipes in C++. Academic
   Press, ISBN 0-12-479040-2, US $45 incl. disks. "Lots of very good practical
   advice which most other books lack."

   1.) Books for the beginner:
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Aleksander, I. and Morton, H. (1990). An Introduction to Neural Computing.
   Chapman and Hall. (ISBN 0-412-37780-2). Comments: "This book seems to
   be intended for the first year of university education."

   Beale, R. and Jackson, T. (1990). Neural Computing, an Introduction. Adam
   Hilger, IOP Publishing Ltd : Bristol. (ISBN 0-85274-262-2). Comments:
   "It's clearly written. Lots of hints as to how to get the adaptive models covered
   to work (not always well explained in the original sources). Consistent
   mathematical terminology. Covers perceptrons, error-backpropagation,
   Kohonen self-org model, Hopfield type models, ART, and associative
   memories."

   Dayhoff, J. E. (1990). Neural Network Architectures: An Introduction. Van
   Nostrand Reinhold: New York. Comments: "Like Wasserman's book,
   Dayhoff's book is also very easy to understand".

   Fausett, L. V. (1994). Fundamentals of Neural Networks: Architectures,
   Algorithms and Applications, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-13-334186-0. Also
   published as a Prentice Hall International Edition, ISBN 0-13-042250-9.
   Sample softeware (source code listings in C and Fortran) is included in an
   Instructor's Manual. "Intermediate in level between Wasserman and
   Hertz/Krogh/Palmer. Algorithms for a broad range of neural networks,
   including a chapter on Adaptive Resonace Theory with ART2. Simple
   examples for each network."

   Freeman, James (1994). Simulating Neural Networks with Mathematica,
   Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-201-56629-X. Helps the reader make his own
   NNs. The mathematica code for the programs in the book is also available
   through the internet: Send mail to MathSource@wri.com or try 
   http://www.wri.com/ on the World Wide Web.

   Hecht-Nielsen, R. (1990). Neurocomputing. Addison Wesley. Comments: "A
   good book", "comprises a nice historical overview and a chapter about NN
   hardware. Well structured prose. Makes important concepts clear."

   McClelland, J. L. and Rumelhart, D. E. (1988). Explorations in Parallel
   Distributed Processing: Computational Models of Cognition and Perception
   (software manual). The MIT Press. Comments: "Written in a tutorial style,
   and includes 2 diskettes of NN simulation programs that can be compiled on
   MS-DOS or Unix (and they do too !)"; "The programs are pretty reasonable as
   an introduction to some of the things that NNs can do."; "There are *two*
   editions of this book. One comes with disks for the IBM PC, the other comes
   with disks for the Macintosh".

   McCord Nelson, M. and Illingworth, W.T. (1990). A Practical Guide to
   Neural Nets. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. (ISBN
   0-201-52376-0). Comments: "No formulas at all"; "It does not have much
   detailed model development (very few equations), but it does present many
   areas of application. It includes a chapter on current areas of research. A
   variety of commercial applications is discussed in chapter 1. It also includes a
   program diskette with a fancy graphical interface (unlike the PDP diskette)".

   Muller, B. and Reinhardt, J. (1990). Neural Networks, An Introduction.
   Springer-Verlag: Berlin Heidelberg New York (ISBN: 3-540-52380-4 and
   0-387-52380-4). Comments: The book was developed out of a course on
   neural-network models with computer demonstrations that was taught by the
   authors to Physics students. The book comes together with a PC-diskette. The
   book is divided into three parts: (1) Models of Neural Networks; describing
   several architectures and learing rules, including the mathematics. (2)
   Statistical Physiscs of Neural Networks; "hard-core" physics section
   developing formal theories of stochastic neural networks. (3) Computer Codes;
   explanation about the demonstration programs. First part gives a nice
   introduction into neural networks together with the formulas. Together with
   the demonstration programs a 'feel' for neural networks can be developed.

   Orchard, G.A. & Phillips, W.A. (1991). Neural Computation: A Beginner's
   Guide. Lawrence Earlbaum Associates: London. Comments: "Short
   user-friendly introduction to the area, with a non-technical flavour.
   Apparently accompanies a software package, but I haven't seen that yet".

   Rao, V.B & H.V. (1993). C++ Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic. MIS:Press,
   ISBN 1-55828-298-x, US $45 incl. disks. "Probably not 'leading edge' stuff
   but detailed enough to get your hands dirty!"

   Wasserman, P. D. (1989). Neural Computing: Theory & Practice. Van
   Nostrand Reinhold: New York. (ISBN 0-442-20743-3) Comments:
   "Wasserman flatly enumerates some common architectures from an engineer's
   perspective ('how it works') without ever addressing the underlying
   fundamentals ('why it works') - important basic concepts such as clustering,
   principal components or gradient descent are not treated. It's also full of
   errors, and unhelpful diagrams drawn with what appears to be PCB board
   layout software from the '70s. For anyone who wants to do active research in
   the field I consider it quite inadequate"; "Okay, but too shallow"; "Quite easy
   to understand"; "The best bedtime reading for Neural Networks. I have given
   this book to numerous collegues who want to know NN basics, but who never
   plan to implement anything. An excellent book to give your manager."

   Wasserman, P.D. (1993). Advanced Methods in Neural Computing. Van
   Nostrand Reinhold: New York (ISBN: 0-442-00461-3). Comments: Several
   neural network topics are discussed e.g. Probalistic Neural Networks,
   Backpropagation and beyond, neural control, Radial Basis Function Networks,
   Neural Engineering. Furthermore, several subjects related to neural networks
   are mentioned e.g. genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, chaos. Just the
   functionality of these subjects is described; enough to get you started. Lots of
   references are given to more elaborate descriptions. Easy to read, no extensive
   mathematical background necessary.

   2.) The classics:
   +++++++++++++++++

   Kohonen, T. (1984). Self-organization and Associative Memory.
   Springer-Verlag: New York. (2nd Edition: 1988; 3rd edition: 1989).
   Comments: "The section on Pattern mathematics is excellent."

   Rumelhart, D. E. and McClelland, J. L. (1986). Parallel Distributed
   Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition (volumes 1 & 2).
   The MIT Press. Comments: "As a computer scientist I found the two
   Rumelhart and McClelland books really heavy going and definitely not the
   sort of thing to read if you are a beginner."; "It's quite readable, and affordable
   (about $65 for both volumes)."; "THE Connectionist bible".

   3.) Introductory journal articles:
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Hinton, G. E. (1989). Connectionist learning procedures. Artificial
   Intelligence, Vol. 40, pp. 185--234. Comments: "One of the better neural
   networks overview papers, although the distinction between network topology
   and learning algorithm is not always very clear. Could very well be used as an
   introduction to neural networks."

   Knight, K. (1990). Connectionist, Ideas and Algorithms. Communications of
   the ACM. November 1990. Vol.33 nr.11, pp 59-74. Comments:"A good
   article, while it is for most people easy to find a copy of this journal."

   Anderson, J. A. and Rosenfeld, E. (Eds). (1988). Neurocomputing: Foundations

   book, but excellent for reference. It is a collection of reprints of most of the
   major papers in the field." 

   Anderson, J. A., Pellionisz, A. and Rosenfeld, E. (Eds). (1990).

   and Signal Processing. John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, England, 1993, ISBN
   0-471-930105 (hardbound), 526 pages, $57.95. "Partly a textbook and partly a
   research monograph; introduces the basic concepts, techniques, and models
   related to neural networks and optimization, excluding rigorous mathematical
   details. Accessible to a wide readership with a differential calculus
   background. The main coverage of the book is on recurrent neural networks
   with continuous state variables. The book title would be more appropriate
   without mentioning signal processing. Well edited, good illustrations."

   Khanna, T. (1990). Foundations of Neural Networks. Addison-Wesley: New
   York. Comments: "Not so bad (with a page of erroneous formulas (if I
   remember well), and #hidden layers isn't well described)."; "Khanna's
   intention in writing his book with math analysis should be commended but he
   made several mistakes in the math part".

   NJ.

   Levine, D. S. (1990). Introduction to Neural and Cognitive Modeling.

   Lippmann, R. P. (April 1987). An introduction to computing with neural nets.
   IEEE Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Magazine. vol. 2, no. 4, pp
   4-22. Comments: "Much acclaimed as an overview of neural networks, but
   rather inaccurate on several points. The categorization into binary and
   continuous- valued input neural networks is rather arbitrary, and may work
   confusing for the unexperienced reader. Not all networks discussed are of
   equal importance."

   Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. (ISBN 0-201-12584-6)
   Comments: "An excellent book that ties together classical approaches to
   pattern recognition with Neural Nets. Most other NN books do not even
   mention conventional approaches."

   Rumelhart, D. E., Hinton, G. E. and Williams, R. J. (1986). Learning
   representations by back-propagating errors. Nature, vol 323 (9 October), pp.
   533-536. Comments: "Gives a very good potted explanation of backprop
   NN's. It gives sufficient detail to write your own NN simulation."

   Simpson, P. K. (1990). Artificial Neural Systems: Foundations, Paradigms,
   Applications and Implementations. Pergamon Press: New York. Comments:
   "Contains a very useful 37 page bibliography. A large number of paradigms
   are presented. On the negative side the book is very shallow. Best used as a
   complement to other books".

   Title:   The Behavioral and Brain Sciences
   Publish: Cambridge University Press
   Remark:  (Expensive as hell, I'm sure.)
            This is a delightful journal that encourages discussion on a
            variety of controversial topics.  I have especially enjoyed
            reading some papers in there by Dana Ballard and Stephen
            Grossberg (separate papers, not collaborations) a few years
            back.  They have a really neat concept: they get a paper,
            then invite a number of noted scientists in the field to
            praise it or trash it.  They print these commentaries, and
            give the author(s) a chance to make a rebuttal or
            concurrence.  Sometimes, as I'm sure you can imagine, things
            get pretty lively.  I'm reasonably sure they are still at
            it--I think I saw them make a call for reviewers a few
            months ago.  Their reviewers are called something like
            Behavioral and Brain Associates, and I believe they have to
            be nominated by current associates, and should be fairly
            well established in the field.  That's probably more than I
            really know about it but maybe if you post it someone who
            knows more about it will correct any errors I have made.
            The main thing is that I liked the articles I read. (Note:

      simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of single
      neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract
      neuronal components. Most current GENESIS applications involve
      realistic simulations of biological neural systems. Although the
      software can also model more abstract networks, other simulators are
      more suitable for backpropagation and similar connectionist modeling.
      Available for ftp with the following procedure: Use 'telnet' to 
      genesis.bbb.caltech.edu and login as the user "genesis" (no password). If
      you answer all the questions, an 'ftp' account will automatically be
      created for you. You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download

      /pub/SNNS as SNNSv3.2.tar.Z (2 MB, Source code) and 
      SNNSv3.2.Manual.ps.Z (1.4 MB, Documentation). There are also
      various other files in this directory (e.g. the source version of the
      manual, a Sun Sparc executable, older versions of the software, some
      papers, and the software in several smaller parts). It may be best to first
      have a look at the file SNNSv3.2.Readme (10 kb). This file contains a
      somewhat more elaborate short description of the simulator. 

    11. Aspirin/MIGRAINES
    +++++++++++++++++++++

      Aspirin/MIGRAINES 6.0 consists of a code generator that builds
      neural network simulations by reading a network description (written
      in a language called "Aspirin") and generates a C simulation. An
      interface (called "MIGRAINES") is provided to export data from the
      neural network to visualization tools. The system has been ported to a
      large number of platforms. The goal of Aspirin is to provide a common
      extendible front-end language and parser for different network
      paradigms. The MIGRAINES interface is a terminal based interface
      that allows you to open Unix pipes to data in the neural network. Users
      can display the data using either public or commercial
      graphics/analysis tools. Example filters are included that convert data
      exported through MIGRAINES to formats readable by Gnuplot 3.0,
      Matlab, Mathematica, and xgobi. The software is available from two
      FTP sites: from CMU's simulator collection on pt.cs.cmu.edu
      [128.2.254.155] in /afs/cs/project/connect/code/am6.tar.Z and from
      UCLA's cognitive science machine ftp.cognet.ucla.edu [128.97.50.19]
      in /pub/alexis/am6.tar.Z (2 MB). 

    12. Adaptive Logic Network kit
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      This package differs from the traditional nets in that it uses logic
      functions rather than floating point; for many tasks, ALN's can show
      many orders of magnitude gain in training and performance speed.
      Anonymous ftp from menaik.cs.ualberta.ca [129.128.4.241] in
      directory /pub/atree. See the files README (7 KB), atree2.tar.Z (145
      kb, Unix source code and examples), atree2.ps.Z (76 kb,
      documentation), a27exe.exe (412 kb, MS-Windows 3.x executable), 
      atre27.exe (572 kb, MS-Windows 3.x source code). 

    13. NeuralShell
    +++++++++++++++

      Formerly available from FTP site quanta.eng.ohio-state.edu
      [128.146.35.1] as /pub/NeuralShell/NeuralShell.tar". Currently (April
      94) not available and undergoing a major reconstruction. Not to be
      confused with NeuroShell by Ward System Group (see below under

      nic.funet.fi [128.214.6.100] as /pub/sci/neural/sims/pdp.tar.Z (202 kb).
      The simulator is also available with the book "Explorations in Parallel
      Distributed Processing: A Handbook of Models, Programs, and
      Exercises" by McClelland and Rumelhart. MIT Press, 1988. Comment:
      "This book is often referred to as PDP vol III which is a very
      misleading practice! The book comes with software on an IBM disk but
      includes a makefile for compiling on UNIX systems. The version of
      PDP available at ftp.funet.fi seems identical to the one with the book
      except for a bug in bp.c which occurs when you try to run a script of
      PDP commands using the DO command. This can be found and fixed
      easily." 

    15. Xerion

    19. SESAME
    ++++++++++

      ("Software Environment for the Simulation of Adaptive Modular
      Systems") SESAME is a prototypical software implementation which
      facilitates 
       o Object-oriented building blocks approach. 
       o Contains a large set of C++ classes useful for neural nets,
         neurocontrol and pattern recognition. No C++ classes can be
         used as stand alone, though! 
       o C++ classes include CartPole, nondynamic two-robot arms,
         Lunar Lander, Backpropagation, Feature Maps, Radial Basis
         Functions, TimeWindows, Fuzzy Set Coding, Potential Fields,
         Pandemonium, and diverse utility building blocks. 
       o A kernel which is the framework for the C++ classes and allows
         run-time manipulation, construction, and integration of

    20. Nevada Backpropagation (NevProp)
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      NevProp is a free, easy-to-use feedforward backpropagation
      (multilayer perceptron) program. It uses an interactive character-based
      interface, and is distributed as C source code that should compile and
      run on most platforms. (Precompiled executables are available for
      Macintosh and DOS.) The original version was Quickprop 1.0 by Scott
      Fahlman, as translated from Common Lisp by Terry Regier. We added
      early-stopped training based on a held-out subset of data, c index
      (ROC curve area) calculation, the ability to force gradient descent
      (per-epoch or per-pattern), and additional options. FEATURES
      (NevProp version 1.16): UNLIMITED (except by machine memory)
      number of input PATTERNS; UNLIMITED number of input, hidden,
      and output UNITS; Arbitrary CONNECTIONS among the various
      layers' units; Clock-time or user-specified RANDOM SEED for
      initial random weights; Choice of regular GRADIENT DESCENT or
      QUICKPROP; Choice of PER-EPOCH or PER-PATTERN
      (stochastic) weight updating; GENERALIZATION to a test dataset;
      AUTOMATICALLY STOPPED TRAINING based on generalization;
      RETENTION of best-generalizing weights and predictions; Simple
      but useful GRAPHIC display to show smoothness of generalization;
      SAVING of results to a file while working interactively; SAVING of
      weights file and reloading for continued training; PREDICTION-only
      on datasets by applying an existing weights file; In addition to RMS
      error, the concordance, or c index is displayed. The c index (area under
      the ROC curve) shows the correctness of the RELATIVE ordering of
      predictions AMONG the cases; ie, it is a measure of discriminative
      power of the model. AVAILABILITY: The most updated version of
      NevProp will be made available by anonymous ftp from the University
      of Nevada, Reno: On ftp.scs.unr.edu [134.197.10.130] in the directory
      "pub/goodman/nevpropdir", e.g. README.FIRST (45 kb) or 
      nevprop1.16.shar (138 kb). VERSION 2 to be released in Spring of
      1994 -- some of the new features: more flexible file formatting
      (including access to external data files; option to prerandomize data
      order; randomized stochastic gradient descent; option to rescale
      predictor (input) variables); linear output units as an alternative to
      sigmoidal units for use with continuous-valued dependent variables
      (output targets); cross-entropy (maximum likelihood) criterion
      function as an alternative to square error for use with categorical
      dependent variables (classification/symbolic/nominal targets); and
      interactive interrupt to change settings on-the-fly. Limited support is
      available from Phil Goodman (goodman@unr.edu), University of
      Nevada Center for Biomedical Research.

    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is a very efficient implementation of
      the back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.
      The algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
      descent. All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
      and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
      peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
      caches. On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x
      speed-up can be measured with respect to conventional
      implementations. The software is available by anonymous ftp from
      risc6000.dibe.unige.it [130.251.89.154] as /pub/MBPv1.1.tar.Z (Unix

    29. NeuDL -- Neural-Network Description Language
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      NeuDL is a description language for the design, training, and operation
      of neural networks. It is currently limited to the backpropagation
      neural-network model; however, it offers a great deal of flexibility.
      For example, the user can explicitly specify the connections between
      nodes and can create or destroy connections dynamically as training
      progresses. NeuDL is an interpreted language resembling C or C++. It
      also has instructions dealing with training/testing set manipulation as
      well as neural network operation. A NeuDL program can be run in
      interpreted mode or it can be automatically translated into C++ which
      can be compiled and then executed. The NeuDL interpreter is written
      in C++ and can be easly extended with new instructions. NeuDL is
      available from the anonymous ftp site at The University of Alabama:
      cs.ua.edu (130.160.44.1) in the file /pub/neudl/NeuDLver021.tar. The
      tarred file contains the interpreter source code (in C++) a user manual,
      a paper about NeuDL, and about 25 sample NeuDL programs. A
      document demonstrating NeuDL's capabilities is also available from
      the ftp site: /pub/neudl/NeuDL/demo.doc /pub/neudl/demo.doc. For
      more information contact the author: Joey Rogers

      The Neural Network Toolbox is a powerful collection of MATLAB
      functions for the design, training, and simulation of neural networks. It
      supports a wide range of network architectures with an unlimited
      number of processing elements and interconnections (up to operating
      system constraints). Supported architectures and training methods
      include: supervised training of feedforward networks using the
      perceptron learning rule, Widrow-Hoff rule, several variations on
      backpropagation (including the fast Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm),
      and radial basis networks; supervised training of recurrent Elman
      networks; unsupervised training of associative networks including
      competitive and feature map layers; Kohonen networks,
      self-organizing maps, and learning vector quantization. The Neural
      Network Toolbox contains a textbook-quality Users' Guide, uses
      tutorials, reference materials and sample applications with code
      examples to explain the design and use of each network architecture
      and paradigm. The Toolbox is delivered as MATLAB M-files,
      enabling users to see the algorithms and implementations, as well as to
      make changes or create new functions to address a specific application.

      (Comment by Richard Andrew Miles Outerbridge,
      RAMO@UVPHYS.PHYS.UVIC.CA:) Matlab is spreading like
      hotcakes (and the educational discounts are very impressive). The
      newest release of Matlab (4.0) ansrwers the question "if you could only
      program in one language what would it be?". The neural network
      toolkit is worth getting for the manual alone. Matlab is available with
      lots of other toolkits (signal processing, optimization, etc.) but I don't
      use them much - the main package is more than enough. The nice thing
      about the Matlab approach is that you can easily interface the neural
      network stuff with anything else you are doing.

      Founders: Dr. Leon Cooper (having a Nobel Price) and Dr. Charles
      Elbaum (Brown University). Neural Network Models: Adaptive shape
      and pattern recognition (Restricted Coulomb Energy - RCE) developed
      by NESTOR is one of the most powerfull Neural Network Model used
      in a later products. The basis for NESTOR products is the Nestor
      Learning System - NLS. Later are developed: Character Learning
      System - CLS and Image Learning System - ILS. Nestor Development
      System - NDS is a development tool in Standard C - one of the most
      powerfull PC-Tools for simulation and development of Neural
      Networks. NLS is a multi-layer, feed forward system with low
      connectivity within each layer and no relaxation procedure used for
      determining an output response. This unique architecture allows the
      NLS to operate in real time without the need for special computers or
      custom hardware. NLS is composed of multiple neural networks, each
      specializing in a subset of information about the input patterns. The
      NLS integrates the responses of its several parallel networks to produce
      a system response that is far superior to that of other neural networks.
      Minimized connectivity within each layer results in rapid training and
      efficient memory utilization- ideal for current VLSI technology. Intel
      has made such a chip - NE1000.

    10. NuTank
    ++++++++++

      NuTank stands for NeuralTank. It is educational and entertainment
      software. In this program one is given the shell of a 2 dimentional
      robotic tank. The tank has various I/O devices like wheels, whiskers,
      optical sensors, smell, fuel level, sound and such. These I/O sensors are
      connected to Neurons. The player/designer uses more Neurons to
      interconnect the I/O devices. One can have any level of complexity
      desired (memory limited) and do subsumptive designs. More complex
      design take slightly more fuel, so life is not free. All movement costs
      fuel too. One can also tag neuron connections as "adaptable" that adapt
      their weights in acordance with the target neuron. This allows neurons
      to learn. The Neuron editor can handle 3 dimention arrays of neurons
      as single entities with very flexible interconect patterns.

      One can then design a scenario with walls, rocks, lights, fat (fuel)
      sources (that can be smelled) and many other such things. Robot tanks
      are then introduced into the Scenario and allowed interact or battle it
      out. The last one alive wins, or maybe one just watches the motion of
      the robots for fun. While the scenario is running it can be stopped,
      edited, zoom'd, and can track on any robot.

      The entire program is mouse and graphicly based. It uses DOS and
      VGA and is written in TurboC++. There will also be the ability to
      download designs to another computer and source code will be
      available for the core neural simulator. This will allow one to design
      neural systems and download them to real robots. The design tools can
      handle three dimentional networks so will work with video camera
      inputs and such. Eventualy I expect to do a port to UNIX and multi
      thread the sign. I also expect to do a Mac port and maybe NT or OS/2

      capabilities: Uses backpropagation techniques to initially select fuzzy
      rules and membership functions. The result is a fuzzy associative
      memory (FAM) which implements an approximation of the training
      data. Operating Systems: 486DX-25 or higher with math co-processor
      DOS 5.0 or higher with Windows 3.1, mouse, VGA or better,
      minimum 4 MB RAM, and parallel port. Approx. price : depends on
      version - see below. Comments : Not for the serious Neural Network
      researcher, but good for a person who has little understanding of
      Neural Nets - and wants to keep it that way. The systems are aimed at
      low end controls applications in automotive, industrial, and appliance
      areas. NeuFuz is a neural-fuzzy technology which uses
      backpropagation techniques to initially select fuzzy rules and
      membership functions. Initial stages of design using NeuFuz
      technology are performed using training data and backpropagation. The
      result is a fuzzy associative memory (FAM) which implements an
      approximation of the training data. By implementing a FAM, rather
      than a multi-layer perceptron, the designer has a solution which can be
      understood and tuned to a particular application using Fuzzy Logic
      design techniques. There are several different versions, some with
      COP8 Code Generator (COP8 is National's family of 8-bit
      microcontrollers) and COP8 in-circuit emulator (debug module).

    ++++++++++

      PARTEK is a powerful, integrated environment for visual and
      quantitative data analysis and pattern recognition. Drawing from a
      wide variety of disciplines including Artificial Neural Networks,
      Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, and Statistics, PARTEK integrates
      data analysis and modeling tools into an easy to use "point and click"
      system. The following modules are available from PARTEK; functions
      from different modules are integrated with each other whereever
      possible: 
       1. The PARTEK/AVB - The Analytical/Visual Base. (TM) 

              * Analytical Spreadsheet (TM)
                The Analytical Spreadsheet is a powerful and easy to use data analysis,
                transformations, and visualization tool.  Some features include:
                   - import native format ascii/binary data
                   - recognition and resolution of missing data
                   - complete set of common mathematical & statistical functions

                   - univariate histogram analysis
                   - extensive set of smoothing and normalization transformations
                   - easily and quickly plot color-coded 1-D curves and histograms,
                     2-D, 3-D, and N-D mapped scatterplots, highlighting selected
                     patterns
                   - Command Line (Tcl) and Graphical Interface

              * Pattern Visualization System (TM)
                The Pattern Visualization System offers the most powerful tools for
                visual analysis of the patterns in your data.  Some features include:
                   - automatically maps N-D data down to 3-D for visualization of
                     *all* of your variables at once
                   - hard copy color Postscript output
                   - a variety of color-coding, highlighting, and labeling options
                     allow you to generate meaningful graphics

              * Data Filters
                Filter out selected rows and/or columns of your data for flexible and
                efficient cross-validation, jackknifing, bootstrapping, feature set
                evaluation, and more.

              * Random # Generators
                Generate random numbers from any of the following parameterized 
                distributions:
                   - uniform, normal, exponential, gamma, binomial, poisson

              * Many distance/similarity metrics
                Choose the appropriate distance metric for your data:
                   - euclidean, mahalanobis, minkowski, maximum value, absolute value,
                     shape coefficient, cosine coefficient, pearson correlation,
                     rank correlation, kendall's tau, canberra, and bray-curtis

              * Tcl/Tk command line interface

       2. The PARTEK/DSA - Data Structure Analysis Module 

              * Principal Components Analysis and Regression
                Also known as Eigenvector Projection or Karhunen-Loeve Expansions,
                PCA removes redundant information from your data.
                   - component analysis, correlate PC's with original variables
                   - choice of covariance, correlation, or product dispersion matrices
                   - choice of eigenvector, y-score, and z-score projections
                   - view SCREE and log-eigenvalue plots

              * Cluster Analysis
                Does the data form groups?  How many?  How compact?  Cluster Analysis
                is the tool to answer these questions.
                   - choose between several distance metrics
                   - optionally weight individual patterns
                   - manually or auto-select the cluster number and initial centers
                   - dump cluster counts, mean, cluster to cluster distances,
                     cluster variances, and cluster labeled data to a matrix viewer or
                     the Analytical Spreadsheet for further analysis
                   - visualize n-dimensional clustering
                   - assess goodness of partion using several internal and external
                     criteria metrics

              * N-Dimensional Histogram Analysis
                Among the most inportant questions a researcher needs to know when
                analyzing patterns is whether or not the patterns can distinguish
                different classes of data.  N-D Histogram Analysis is one tool to 
                answer this question.
                   - measures histogram overlap in n-dimensional space
                   - automatically find the best subset of features
                   - rank the overlap of your best feature combinations

              * Non-Linear Mapping
                NLM is an iterative algorithm for visually analyzing the structure of
                n-dimensional data.  NLM produces a non-linear mapping of data which
                preserves interpoint distances of n-dimensional data while reducing
                to a lower dimensionality - thus preserving the structure of the data.
                   - visually analyze structure of n-dimensional data
                   - track progress with error curves
                   - orthogonal, PCA, and random initialization

       3. The PARTEK/CP - Classification and Prediction Module. 

              * Multi-Layer Perceptron
                The most popular among the neural pattern recognition tools is the MLP.
                PARTEK takes the MLP to a new dimension, by allowing the network to 
                learn by adapting ALL of its parameters to solve a problem.
                   - adapts output bias, neuron activation steepness, and neuron
                     dynamic range, as well as weights and input biases
                   - auto-scaling at input and output - no need to rescale your data
                   - choose between sigmoid, gaussian, linear, or mixture of neurons
                   - learning rate, momentum can be set independently for each parameter
                   - variety of learning methods and network initializations
                   - view color-coded network, error, etc as network trains, tests, runs

              * Learning Vector Quantization
                Because LVQ is a multiple prototype classifier, it adapts to identify
                multiple sub-groups within classes
                   - LVQ1, LVQ2, and LVQ3 training methods
                   - 3 different functions for adapting learning rate
                   - choose between several distance metrics
                   - fuzzy and crisp classifications
                   - set number of prototypes individually for each class

              * Bayesian Classifier
                Bayes methods are the statistical decision theory approach to 
                classification.  This classifier uses statistical properties of your
                data to develop a classification model.

      PARTEK is available on HP, IBM, Silicon Graphics, and SUN
      workstations. For more information, send email to "info@partek.com"

      Here are example descriptions of two of these databases: 

      NIST special database 2: Structured Forms Reference Set (SFRS)
      --------------------------------------------------------------

      The NIST database of structured forms contains 5,590 full page images
      of simulated tax forms completed using machine print. THERE IS NO
      REAL TAX DATA IN THIS DATABASE. The structured forms used
      in this database are 12 different forms from the 1988, IRS 1040
      Package X. These include Forms 1040, 2106, 2441, 4562, and 6251
      together with Schedules A, B, C, D, E, F and SE. Eight of these forms
      contain two pages or form faces making a total of 20 form faces
      represented in the database. Each image is stored in bi-level black and
      white raster format. The images in this database appear to be real
      forms prepared by individuals but the images have been automatically
      derived and synthesized using a computer and contain no "real" tax
      data. The entry field values on the forms have been automatically
      generated by a computer in order to make the data available without
      the danger of distributing privileged tax information. In addition to the
      images the database includes 5,590 answer files, one for each image.
      Each answer file contains an ASCII representation of the data found in
      the entry fields on the corresponding image. Image format
      documentation and example software are also provided. The
      uncompressed database totals approximately 5.9 gigabytes of data. 

      NIST special database 3: Binary Images of Handwritten Segmented
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      Characters (HWSC)
      -----------------

      Contains 313,389 isolated character images segmented from the 2,100
      full-page images distributed with "NIST Special Database 1". 223,125
      digits, 44,951 upper-case, and 45,313 lower-case character images.
      Each character image has been centered in a separate 128 by 128 pixel
      region, error rate of the segmentation and assigned classification is less
      than 0.1%. The uncompressed database totals approximately 2.75
      gigabytes of image data and includes image format documentation and
      example software.

      The system requirements for all databases are a 5.25" CD-ROM drive
      with software to read ISO-9660 format. Contact: Darrin L. Dimmick;
      dld@magi.ncsl.nist.gov; (301)975-4147

      The prices of the databases are between US$ 250 and 1895 If you wish
      to order a database, please contact: Standard Reference Data; National
      Institute of Standards and Technology; 221/A323; Gaithersburg, MD
      20899; Phone: (301)975-2208; FAX: (301)926-0416

      Samples of the data can be found by ftp on sequoyah.ncsl.nist.gov in
      directory /pub/data A more complete description of the available
      databases can be obtained from the same host as

      Codes, Digits, and Alphabetic Characters
      ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

      The Center Of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition
      (CEDAR) State University of New York at Buffalo announces the
      availability of CEDAR CDROM 1: USPS Office of Advanced
      Technology The database contains handwritten words and ZIP Codes in
      high resolution grayscale (300 ppi 8-bit) as well as binary handwritten
      digits and alphabetic characters (300 ppi 1-bit). This database is
      intended to encourage research in off-line handwriting recognition by
      providing access to handwriting samples digitized from envelopes in a
      working post office. 

           Specifications of the database include:
           +    300 ppi 8-bit grayscale handwritten words (cities,
                states, ZIP Codes)
                o    5632 city words
                o    4938 state words
                o    9454 ZIP Codes
           +    300 ppi binary handwritten characters and digits:
                o    27,837 mixed alphas  and  numerics  segmented
                     from address blocks
                o    21,179 digits segmented from ZIP Codes
           +    every image supplied with  a  manually  determined
                truth value
           +    extracted from live mail in a  working  U.S.  Post
                Office
           +    word images in the test  set  supplied  with  dic-
                tionaries  of  postal  words that simulate partial
                recognition of the corresponding ZIP Code.
           +    digit images included in test  set  that  simulate
                automatic ZIP Code segmentation.  Results on these
                data can be projected to overall ZIP Code recogni-
                tion performance.
           +    image format documentation and software included

      System requirements are a 5.25" CD-ROM drive with software to read
      ISO-9660 format. For any further information, including how to order
      the database, please contact: Jonathan J. Hull, Associate Director,

    7. Time series archive
    ++++++++++++++++++++++

      Various datasets of time series (to be used for prediction learning
      problems) are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.santafe.edu
      [192.12.12.1] in /pub/Time-Series". Problems are for example:
      fluctuations in a far-infrared laser; Physiological data of patients with
      sleep apnea; High frequency currency exchange rate data; Intensity of a
      white dwarf star; J.S. Bachs final (unfinished) fugue from "Die Kunst
      der Fuge"

      Some of the datasets were used in a prediction contest and are
      described in detail in the book "Time series prediction: Forecasting the
      future and understanding the past", edited by Weigend/Gershenfield,
      Proceedings Volume XV in the Santa Fe Institute Studies in the
