
What are Neural Networks?

So, just what are neural networks, anyway?  The purists will tell
you that a neural network is the collection of ectodermic tissue
responsible for nervous action in an animal.  So we will back away
from use of the short form, and say, "Just what are Artificial
Neural Networks, anyway?"  Here, we may define an ANN as a method
of computation whose properties are dependent upon the use of
relatively low-level processors displaying a high degree of
interconnectivity.  Usually, the connections between processors are
modifiable.  Usually, the ANN performs its given task in a
non-linear fashion.  Usually, it is difficult to say anything
definite about ANNs because there are so many models with widely
divergent assumptions and methods of operation.


Just because the brain looks like a mess of porridge doesn't mean
it's a cereal computer.  -- Michael Arbib
  
As Arbib scores with a truly horrific pun, we can yet see that
there is a point made here of grave concern for the future of
computing.  The serial computer is a wonderful tool, yet there are
certain inherent limits to its theoretical performance.

The speed of propagation of electrical impulses places an arbitrary
limit on the rate of computation of a single, serial processor. 
Our current processors best performance capability does not compare
favorably with the computational skills of, say, a fly (see Figure
1).  Of course, this is an unfair comparison -- we are estimating
how well these serial, digital computers could perform the tasks
which a worm, a leech, or a fly must perform.  A reversed
comparison would, naturally, be far more favorable to the
computers.  But many of the problems which a fly must perform are
of some interest to us.  Just the subject of machine vision can
give us an idea of computational complexity that our current
systems can't hope to handle, at least not at the level and speed
at which a fly is capable of performing.

ANNs hold the promise of helping us break past the "Von Neumann
bottleneck."  Since some ANN models do not require synchronous
operation, we can see that such a system would enable us to skip
right by parallel systems and on to concurrent systems.  No part of
such a network waits for tasks to "finish up" elsewhere -- the
current system state is derived from the state just previous, with
continual updating of individual "neurons" or nodes going on
according to the layout and rules of the model.  The components do
not necessarily have to share the same "clock."
