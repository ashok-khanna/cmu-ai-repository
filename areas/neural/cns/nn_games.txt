On the 5th of february we posted the following message on several
newgroups (comp.ai.neural-nets, rec.games.backgammon, rec.games.go,
rec.games.chess, rec.games.misc)

>This is a request for articles, ideas and anything else you might
>think useful after reading this.
>We have decided that we are going to do a master's thesis on the

>So we are looking for anything we can get on this subject.
>Some ideas: games, complexity of games, strategy with AI
>We would also like to get ftp-sites for articles, programs and
>the like.
>Feel free to respond (via e-mail preferably).
>If we get enough responds (>2 :-) we will make a summary of the data

As the response to our message exceeded the threshold we set (2) we'll
summarize. But before all that, all this:

1) Before we start working on our thesis we will make a taxonomy of
(fairly) recent developments on Neural Networks and `Strategy', so
information is still welcome;

2) A good place to start looking for stuff is the FAQ-posting;

3) We don't actually know what is costumary about publishing
email-addresses. We think it would be a bad idea to post
email-addresses on netnews, as people would probably try and send
their requests to the writers of the articles themselves, thus
clogging mailboxes all over the place. So, we decided that we will
only give email-addresses from people who replied to our posting;

4) When using anonymous ftp, use your email-address as password: only
then the ftp-site will be able to contact you when necessary;

5) This space unintentionally left blank

As our prime interest is the application of neural networks in game
playing, we'll start this summary with:

ON NEURAL NETS AND GO

David Stoutamire wrote a report on Machine Learning applied to Go,
available on milton.u.washington.edu (128.95.136.1), directory
public/go, report.ps.Z. Mind you, this takes a LONG time to print!
There is also a lot of go-related software available on milton.
Herbert Enderton has been working on a neural net go program. His tech
report entitled 'the Golem go program' can be obtained ($2, overseas
$5) at: Computer Science Documentation; School of Computer Science;
Carnegie Mellon University; Pittsburgh PA, 15213-3890;
reports@cs.cmu.edu; 412/268-2596. It appears that the network plays
professional looking moves, but is not very good at life and death
yet.

ON NEURAL NETS AND GAMES

Gerald Tesauro has done quite some work with neural nets that play
backgammon. First, he trained a net with expert data sets. The
following articles report on this:

   A Parallel Network that learns to play Backgammon
   G. Tesauro & T.J. Sejnowski
   Artificial Intelligence, vol 39, pp. 357-390, 1989.

   Neurogammon: A Neural Network Backgammon Program
   G. Tesauro & T.J. Sejnowski
   IJCNN Proceedings, vol 3, pp. 33-39, 1990.

To appear in Machine Learning is this article, in which he comments on
temporal difference learning (i.e. training a net from scratch by
playing a copy of itself):

   Practical Issues in Temporal Difference Learning
   G. Tesauro
   Computer Science, #76307 submitted

Also to be found in Artificial Intelligence:

   A Pattern Classification Approach to Evaluation Function Learning
   Kai-Fu Lee and Sanjoy Mahajan
   Artificial Intelligence, vol 36, pp. 1-25, 1988.

We haven't checked this one out yet, so we're not really sure that it
deals with games:

   RAMBOT: A Connectionist Expert System That Learns by Example
   Michael C. Mozer
   Proceedings of the IEEE First International Conference on Neural Networks
      vol 2 (Maureen Caudill editor), pp. 693-700, 1987.

Not very recent, but very legendary is A.L. Samuel's work in the
sixties:

   Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers
   A.L. Samuel
   IBM journal of Research and Development, vol 3, nr. 3, pp. 210-229,
   1959.

   Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers 2 -
      recent progress
   A.L. Samuel
   IBM journal of Research and Development, vol 11, nr. 6, pp.
   601-616, 1967.

Concerning the application of neural networks in bridge:

   Knowledge acquisition and reasoning based on neural networks -
      the research of a bridge bidding system
   He Yo, Zhen Xianjun, Ye Yizheng, Li Zhongrong
   INNC '90, Paris, vol 1, pp. 416-423.

   Experience gained with a neural network that learns to play bridge
   M. Kohle & F. Schonbauer
   Proc. of the 5th Austrian Artificial Intelligence meeting, pp.
   224-229.

ON COMPUTERS AND GO

Bruce Wilcox, author of Nemesis, published a series of articles
entitled "Instant Go" in the American Go Journal. Also, he reported in
SIGART newsletter, october 1985, no 94, on his go programs. Nemesis'
rating is about 15 kyu.

Not really using neural nets, but still interesting:

   FIELD: a data type for automated perception in GO
   Z. Kok and V. Akman
   proc. sixth int. symposium on computer and information sciences
   vol 2, pp. 641-650
   Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam 1991.

ON COMPUTERS AND GAMES

Barney Pell (Barney.Pell@cl.cam.ac.uk) did some very interesting work
on games and learning in a more general context: metagame. His aim is
to program a computer to analyse and play any game, when supplied the
rules.
The annual computer olympiad involves tournaments in a variety of
games. These publications contain a wealth of interesting articles:
   Heuristic Programming in Artificial Intelligence -
      the first computer olympiad
   D.N.L. Levy & D.F. Beal eds.
   Ellis Horwood ltd, 1989.

   Heuristic Programming in Artificial Intelligence 2 -
      the second computer olympiad
   D.N.L. Levy & D.F. Beal eds.
   Ellis Horwood, 1991.

   Heuristic Programming in Artificial Intelligence 3 -
      the third computer olympiad
   H.J. van den Herik & L.V. Allis eds.
   Ellis Horwood, 1992.

To conclude: there are a lot of papers on neural networks available at
the ftp-site archive.cis.ohio-state.edu (128.146.8.52), directory
pub/neuroprose.
