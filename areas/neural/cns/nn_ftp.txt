A list of publicly available simulators for artificial neural networks.

        The following list is by no means to be considered complete or
exhaustive, it merely represents those simulators which have come to my
attention through postings on the internet and articles in various
journals.  Inclusion in this list represents no particular endorsement,
and ommission from the list should be regarded as unfortunate oversight
on the author's part.  The list is provided as a starting point for
individuals and institutions who desire to obtain software suitable to
their needs who wish to examine these offerings.
        The term "publically available" may be taken to mean anything
available at nominal or no cost through channels other than those
conventionally regarded as commercial software products.  Since the term
'public domain' has become synonimous with free and unrestricted
software it should be noted in passing that much of what is available
is, in fact, copyrighted work which must be licensed --albeit at no
cost.
        The term 'ftp' used below stands for file transfer
protocol, which is a means of obtaining and transfering files
between computers linked by an international computer network
collectively know as the Internet.  To obtain more information
concerning ftp or the Internet, please consult operators of your
local computing facility.  The format used for site addresses and
electronic mail addresses below conforms to that currently used on
the Internet. I have included alternate means of obtaining the
simulators where they have come to my attention.

GENESIS - GEneral NEural SImulation System with
XODUS   - X-windows Output and Display Utility for Simulations
A general simulator.

Currently Beta-Test Version, 1990.

From the release announcement ( January, 1990 by Jim Bower ):

"       Full source for the simulator is available via FTP from
genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.135.64).  To acquire FTP access to
this machine it is necessary to first register for distribution by
using telnet or rlogin to login under user "genesis" and then follow
the instructions (e.g. 'telnet genesis.cns.caltech.edu' and ' login as
'genesis').  When necessary, tapes can be provided for a small handling
fee ($50).  Those requiring tapes should send requests to
genesis-req@caltech.bitnet.  Any other questions about the system or
its distribution should also be sent to this address.

        GENESIS and XODUS are written in C and run on SUN and DEC
graphics work stations under UNIX (version 4.0 and up), and X-windows
(version 11).  The software requires 14 meg of disk space and the tar
file is approximately 1 meg.

        The current distribution includes full source for both GENESIS
and XODUS as well as three tutorial simulations (squid axon, multicell,
visual cortex).  Documentation for these tutorials as well as three
papers describing the structure of the simulator are also included. As
described in more detail in the "readme" file at the FTP address, those
interested in in developing new GENESIS applications are encouraged to
become registered members of the GENESIS users group (BABEL) for an
additional one time $200 registration fee.  As a registered user, one
is provided documentation on the simulator itself (currently in an
early stage), access to additional simulator components, bug report
listings, and access to a user's bulletin board.  In addition we are
establishing a depository for additional completed simulations. "

++++++++++++++++++++++++
SunNet
A generalized simulator.

Version 5.5.2.4

Available for anonymous ftp from boulder.colorado.edu (128.138.240.1).

While this program was obviously written for Sun workstations (versions
for suntools and the X-window envirionment), the documents list other
configurations.  These include a non-graphic version which runs on "any
UNIX machine", and versions which run on an Alliant or UNIX machine and
send data to a graphics support program running on a Sun workstation.
It is very easy to install.

A mailing list exists for users of the simulator.

++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have recently moved and thought I should update folks as well
as provide the info for new readers concerning my Macintosh
neural network simulator called Mactivation (now version 3.3):

Mactivation is an introductory neural network simulator which
runs on all Macintoshes.  A graphical interface provides direct
access to units, connections, and patterns. Basic concepts of
associative memory and network operation can be explored, with
many low level parameters available for modification. Back-
propagation is not supported. A user's manual containing an
introduction to connectionist networks and program documentation
is included on one 800K Macintosh disk. The current version is 3.3,
which fixes a very obscure system error and changes some menu names
for clarity (I hope).

Mactivation is available from the author, Mike Kranzdorf. The
program may be freely copied, including for classroom distribution.
To obtain a copy, send your name and address and a check payable
to Mike Kranzdorf for $5 (US). International orders should send either
an international postal money order for five dollars US or ten (10)
international postal coupons.

Mactivation 3.2 is available via anonymous ftp on boulder.colorado.edu
Please don't ask me how to deal with ftp - that's why I offer it via
snail mail.
