I have gathered a list of public domain or shareware neural network software,
which is predominantly for PCs running DOS.  In almost every case, it is
self-evident from the file description and the explanation below which BBS
you can download the file from.
 
Please do not ask me to send you a copy of a particular file, as you can
download it yourself.
 
The software below does not begin to compare with commercially available neural
network tools - there is no free lunch.
 
Files with a "(CNS BBS)" at the end of the line come from the Central Neural
System BBS.  It can be reached in Texas at 817-551-9363 (with modem setup
2400 baud, 8-N-1), and it probably has more neural network
information than any BBS in the country.
[***NOTE***: CNS has moved to Richland, Washington and can be reached at 
509-WIN-1CNS with connect rates up to 9600 bps (using Courier HST protocol).]
 
Files with a "(Shadetree)" come from a bulletin board in Pittsburgh, Penn.
called the "Shadetree BBS", operated by Bill Keller at 412-244-9416, accessible
at 2400 baud, N-8-1 modem setup.  Presently, it is only accessible from 8:30PM
to 8:30AM.  A description of this BBS appears on page 10 of the
November/December issue of "PC AI" magazine.
 
Files which come from "AI Expert" magazine issues are available from various
BBS systems around the world which carry the code accompanying the monthly
issues of this magazine.  The BBS phone numbers are listed in a boxed column
called "AI Expert On-Line" which is always on the page following the one
with the masthead.
 
A few of the files (I can't remember which ones) are from posting to the
USENET newsgroup comp.ai.neural-nets.
