If the board sees enough activity, we will convert to an exclusive line
available 24 hours a day.  As users, you can help achieve this in two
ways:

            *  Get involved in the discussion areas
            *  Upload any AI programs or applications
               that you have developed

Please do not be hesitant about getting involved in a discussion.  This
board is dedicated to BEGINNERS!!  We will be getting input from the
authors of some of the programs but mainly we are all here due to our
curiosity and a desire to learn.

We have started a newsletter aimed at the people who use this board (Issue
number one was a sellout!).  If you are interested, there is a subscription
blank at the end of this text file.  It is being published 6 times a year.
The general format will be letters to the editor, various help columns,
tutorial columns on the different aspects of AI (such as neural nets, LISP,
expert systems, PROLOG, machine learning, etc.), book and product reviews,
file location listings for ShadeTree BBS, ability to order disks via the mail
instead of downloading, column on tips for using ShadeTree BBS in particular
and OPUS bulletin boards in general.  The subscription rate is $9.00 per year.

If you would like to submit an article, series of articles or an idea for a
regular column, please contact us at the address below.  Article submissions
must be on a 360k DS,DD floppy disk in flat ASCII or they may be uploaded
directly to the bbs in a "compressed" format as long as they were originally
done in straight ASCII.  The right side margin should be no more then
60.  Do not indent paragraphs but skip a line between paragraphs.

Thank you for your support.

                            Bill Keller, SysOp
