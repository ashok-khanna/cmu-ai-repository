Hello,
For those who are interested, a demo of a back-propagation neural
network simulation program called Neural-Network Contruction Set
for the Atari ST is available for anonymous ftp at
atari.archive.umich.edu (in atari/demos).  Note that this is a self
running demo, not an otherwise usable program.
Jim
