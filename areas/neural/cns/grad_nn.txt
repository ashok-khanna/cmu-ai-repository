Greetings All.  I recently requested information on graduate programs
with cognitive science content, specifically, for contacts at the various
schools. The following represents the results to date, Sept 19/91..

Some of the entries are scant and even lack contacts, however I did not
want to exclude any of the responses. I will if requested, pass on a copy
of the response that I received from particular schools. Where e-mail
contacts are provided, please mail them directly.

THANKS to everbody who responded.

Description of Program:
     We are doing research in the broad area of neural networks.
However, our main efforts are currently centered in the ASOCS
(Adaptive Self-Organizing Concurrent Systems) Model.  ASOCS are
a class of connectionist models benefitting from self-organizing 
learning a parallel execution.  Current ASOCS guarantee learning
of arbitrary sets of incrementally input rules and learning time
is bounded and logarithmic with the number of nodes in the ASOCS
network.

Faculty Invovled:
Tony Martinez - Total time commitment to neural network research.
Douglas Campbell - Also with research effort in Computational Theory.

Degrees Offered: BS, MS, PhD

 networks, analog VLSI devices, optical devices, and highly parallel 
 digital computers.  Neurobiological simulation approaches include 
 modeling at the systems level (e.g., olfactory cortex, cerebellar cortex, 
 and visual and auditory cortices) and at the cellular level (e.g.,  biophysical 

 and developmental mechanisms).  Computational approaches to artificial 
 systems span a wide range, from studies of associative memory and
 analog networks for sensory processing to graphical image representation
 and the theory of computation.  Interested students are  encouraged to
 combine theoretical or modeling approaches with physiological or
 anatomical research on biological systems.

Indiana University has recently mounted a major initiative in cognitive
science, centring around the departments of Computer Science, Psychology,
Linguistics and Philosophy.

There are also a number a number of separate Research Centers.  The most

relevant of these is the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition.

Other relevant Research Centers and Institutes include Semiotic Studies,
Folklore, the Kinsey Institute (Human Sexuality), the Institute for the Study
of Human Capabilities, and the Program in Neural Science.

The Graduate Program
--------------------
All graduate degrees in Cognitive Science must be associated with another
department's major.  There are two options:
(1) A combined Ph.D. with double major in Cognitive Science and another field.
(2) A Ph.D. in the original field, with a minor in Cognitive Science.

Courses will be taken from the original field, from a selection of core
Cognitive Science courses, and from other departments.

Dave Chalmers is happy to answer informal inquiries about the program (e-mail
dave@cogsci.indiana.edu).  More substantial information, administrative
details, and brochures describing the program can be obtained by writing to
Cathy Barnes, the program secretary, at barnesc@ucs.indiana.edu.  The program
director is Prof. Richard Shiffrin, shiffrin@ucs.indiana.edu.

The University of Pittsburgh's Intelligent Systems Program is a graduate
program leading to a PhD for students interested in artificial
intelligence and cognitive science.  An interdisciplinary program, it has
strong ties to faculty in computer science, psychology, medical
informatics, linguistics, history and philosophy of science, and other
departments.  Major research projects of faculty range over a variety of
formal computational approaches to cognitive science, with substantial
interest in applied as well as purely basic research.  We welcome
inquiries from potential students interested in artificial intelligence
and cognitive science.

               at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University

The National Science Foundation has newly established an innovative
program for students investigating the neurobiology of cognition. 
The program's focus is the interpretation of cognitive functions
in terms of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological data and
computer simulations.  Such functions include perceiving,
attending, learning, planning, and remembering in humans and in
animals.  A carefully designed program of study prepares each
student to perform original research investigating cortical
function at multiple levels of analysis.  State of the art
facilities include: computerized microscopy, human and animal
electrophysiological instrumentation, behavioral assessment
laboratories,  brain scanners, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing

Center, and a regional medical center providing access to human
clinical populations.  This is a joint program between the
University of Pittsburgh, its School of Medicine, and Carnegie
Mellon University.  Each student receives full financial support,
travel allowances and a computer workstation.  

Applications are encouraged from students with interest in biology,
psychology, engineering, physics, mathematics, or computer science.

General Information.
The School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences provides a highly active and
interdisciplinary environment involving linguists,cognitive
psychologists,philosophers and A.I. researchers. The kinds of work undertaken
in the school range from highly practical applications of new ideas in
computing to the most abstract philosophical issues concerning the foundations
of cognitive science. The school attracts a large number of research fellows
and distinguished academic visitors, and interdisciplinary dialogue is
encourage by several weekly research seminars.
