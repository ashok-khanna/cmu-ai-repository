Summary:      Neural Networks Materials from the Central Neural Systems BBS

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains neural networks materials from the Central
   Neural Systems BBS. We've deleted some obsolete files, files which
   are duplicated elsewhere in the AI Repository, and files whose
   copyright restrictions prevent their inclusion in this repository.
   
   We intend to eventually merge these files into the rest of the
   repository, complete with 0.doc index files. For now, however, this
   single 0.doc file will have to do. See the index.txt file for an index
   to the contents of this directory.

              CNS is a free access system -- the user is not required
              to pay any fees for access.  CNS can be reached using 
              eight data bits, one stop bit, and no parity at BPS
              rates from 9600 HST down to 300 BPS.  The CNS phone
              number is 509-627-6CNS (or 509-627-6267 for
              international callers), and the system is available 
              23 hours a day (mail only from 5AM to 6AM Pacific time),
              seven days a week.  CNS is FidoNet node 1:347/303, and
              accepts File Requests from a variety of front-end mail
              packages, such as BinkleyTerm and FrontDoor.
