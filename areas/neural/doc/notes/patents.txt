[There is nothing new in this edition]

    The following is my periodic posting of new (or newly encountered)
patents dealing with neural networks.  Lines below starting with "!" are
new additions to this file.  Comments to explain the titles are enclosed
in brackets [...].   The text of any of these patents can be ordered from
the patent office for $3 in printed form.  Also, for $20, I will provide
a machine readable version of the abstract, text, claims and references
for any neural network patent.

=============================================================================
     For a very good article on the legal issues involving neural network
patents, see the article "Intellectual Property Protection for Neural
Networks" by Donald Wenskay, Neural Networks, 3, pp. 229-236, 1990.
=============================================================================
     For those interested in applying for a neural network patent, I freely
provide a LaTeX template for a patent application.  Please email a request,
and I'll send it to you.  Contains most of the boilerplate you need.
=============================================================================
     To date, I have yet to see any articles in the trade journals on either
companies signing cross-licensing agreements to share their neural network
patents, or patent infringement lawsuits dealing with neural network patents.
To me, this means that no one is making much money with neural networks (other
than selling software), and that the financial return on acquiring a patent
is less than the cost of applying for and maintaining a patent.
     If anyone hears of either occurrence, please let me know.
