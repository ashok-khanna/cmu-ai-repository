Here is a summary of the responses that I recieved about people doing
research in neural networks.  It is by no means complete.  I don't have
a lot of time to do additions, but if you send me material, I will
periodically integrate it into one publication.

Here are some schools and their appropriate departments:
--------
	Stanford	Psychology
   				Dave Rumelhart, David Stork
     Electrical Engineering
       Bernard Widrow
-------- 
	MIT	Brain and Cognitive Sciences
    				Jordan, Poggio, Atkeson, Bizzi
--------
	UCSD	Cognitive Sciences
    Sereno, Kirsh, St. John
   Biology, Computational Neuroscience
	   Terrence Sejnowski, Allen Selverston
   Cognitive Science
	    Jeffrey Elman,  David Zipser
   Economics
	   Halbert White, Maxwell Stinchcombe
   Computer Science
   	Gary Cottrell, Rick Belew, R Paturi
   Electrical Engineering
   	Robert Hecht-Nielsen, Kenneth Kreutz-Delgado,
   	B. Rao, and quite a few others.
   Philosophy
   	Paul Churchaland, Patricia Churchland
   UCSD also has an Institute for Neural Computation. Also, a lot of
   activity takes place at the near by Salk Institute.

--------
	Carnegie Mellon		Psychology and Computer Science
    Psychology 
       James McClelland, Brian MacWhinney, Dave Plaut
   Computation Neuropsychology
     Johnathan Cohen, Mark Johnson
   CS/Robotics
        Dave Touretzky, Alex Waibel, Dean Pomerleau, Scott Fahlman,Tom
Mitchell, Merrick Furst, Avrim Blum
   Engineering
        Ginny Stonick, Vijaya Kumar, Jose Moura, Jim Garrett,David Casasent
   Linguistics
        Wayne Ward
   Chemical Engineering
        Erik Ydstie
There is a new program in computational neuroscience that involves CMU
(mostly the psychology people plus Dave Touretzky), and a larger group of
people at Pitt, including a good number from the medical school there.
