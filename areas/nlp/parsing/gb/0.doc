Name:         Gibberish

Summary:      Prolog Government-binding parser.

Version:      21-AUG-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Gibberish, a first attempt at a
   Government-Binding (GB) type parser. This parser is intended as an
   introductory 'toy' parser for natural-language-understanding courses,
   so complexity will be kept to a minimum while still being general
   enough to be easily extended. All constraints have been been
   implemented as explicit Prolog goals for perspicuity. Many
   optimizations are possible! The gapping mechanism actually performs a
   transformation of the sentence into a 'normal' form and so has been
   made general enough to move arbitrary structures through the parse tree.
