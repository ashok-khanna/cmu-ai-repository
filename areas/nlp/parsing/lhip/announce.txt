The new version of my lhip (left-head-corner island parser) compiler
is now available. Version 1.0 fixes some small problems with v0.1, 
and adds two major features:

	o Explicit specification of adjacency -- 
		e.g.,  p:q in a grammar means that the constituents
		p and q must be adjacent;

	o The chart now keeps track of which successful rule interdependency.
	  This means that it is now possible to examine the chart to find
	  unattached consituents.

The lhip system requires an Edinburgh style Prolog. It is known to work
with Sicstus 0.6. The system compiles grammar rules to Prolog code in
much the same way as the Prolog DCG system does. The rules themselves
are an extended version of the DCG rules, allowing optional constituents,
negation, disjunction, the specification of adjacency, and the ability
to mark multiple heads in a rule body. The system can be retrieved as
follows:

    A) open an ftp connection to issun14.unige.ch (or 129.194.177.14)
       (UNIX: type "ftp issun14.unige.ch").
    B) as login name type "anonymous".
    C) as password type your electronic mail address
       (type something like "afzal@divsun.unige.ch").
    D) change the transfer representation type to "image" (no conversion)
       (UNIX: type "type image").
    E) change directory to "pub" (UNIX: type "cd pub").
    F) retrieve the compressed archive named "lhip_v1.0.tar.Z"
       (UNIX: type "get lhip_v1.0.tar.Z").
    G) terminate the ftp connection (UNIX: type "bye").
    H) uncompress and extract the files from the tar archive
       (UNIX: type "uncompress -c lhip_v1.0.tar.Z |tar xvf -" ).
    I) check the extracted files and send a mail message to
       me (afzal@divsun.unige.ch) mentioning that you have
       successfully retrieved the package.
