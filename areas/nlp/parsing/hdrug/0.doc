Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/hdrug/

Name:         Hdrug

Summary:      Graphical User Environment for NLP in Prolog 

Version:      2.0 (16-SEP-94)

Description: 

   Hdrug is an environment to develop logic grammars, parsers, and
   generators for natural languages.  The package comes with a number of
   example grammars, including a Categorial Grammar, a Tree Adjoining
   Grammar, a Unification Grammar in the spirit of Head-driven Phrase
   Structure Grammar, an Extraposition Grammar and a Definite Clause
   Grammar. Each of the grammars comes with a set of parsers, such as
   Earley-like chart parsers, left-corner parsers and head-driven
   parsers. Some grammars come with variants of the head-driven
   generator.

   The package allows easy comparison of different parsers/generators,
   extensive possibilities of compiling feature equations into Prolog
   terms, graphical (Tk), LaTeX and ordinary Prolog output of trees,
   feature structures and Prolog terms, and plotted graphs and tables of
   statistical information.

   Example grammars, parsers, and generators include TA (the ALE 2.0 HPSG
   grammar, by Bob Carpenter and Gerald Penn), TL (a HPSG grammar
   for Dutch), TT (a small Tree Adjoining Grammar), TG (a small DCG for
   Dutch), TC (a Constraint-based Categorial Grammar for English), TD (a
   minimal DCG), and TX (an extraposition grammar).

Requires:     Sicstus Prolog, ProTcl 1.1 or higher, Tcl 7.3/Tk 3.6.
              Recommend getting TkSteal, BLT library 1.7, LaTeX/Xdvi,
              and Treemaker (TeX extension).

Ports:        The program has been tested for HP-UX 9000/710 730,
              Linux (1.0), and Sun.
