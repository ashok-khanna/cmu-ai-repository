Summary:      Language INdependent Grammatical Error Reporter

Version:      1.1 (4-SEP-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains LINGER, a tool for grammar analysis of
   Western European languages. 

   LINGER is a language-independent system to analyze natural language
   sentences and report and correct grammatical errors encountered. An
   important objective is that the system should be easily configured for a
   particular natural language by an expert in that language but not in
   computer science. 

   This library contains two versions of Linger. The older one contains
   only a French grammar. The more recent also has German, Spanish, and
   English. Both versions were contributed by Paul O'Brien and Masoud
   Yazdani, and were written in Expert Systems International Prolog-2.
