Name:         FLEX

Summary:      Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator

Version:      2.4.3

Description: 

   Fles is a tool for generating programs which recognize lexical
   patterns in text.  Flex reads the given input files for a description
   of a scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of
   regular expressions and C code - these are called rules. Flex
   generates as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine
   yylex(). This file is compiled and linked with the library to produce
   an executable.  When the executable is run, it analyzes its input for
   occurrences of the regular expressions.  Whenever it finds one, it
   executes the corresponding C code.
