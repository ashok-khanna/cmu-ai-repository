Summary:      A Morphology Grammar Builder and Dictionary Interface Tool

Version:      7-OCT-91

Description: 

   This directory contains a demo version of MORFOGEN, a morphological
   rule compiler and dictionary interface tool. MORFOGEN consists of a
   finite state compiler, which converts inflectional and derivational
   paradigms into a finite state machine, and a recognizer, which accepts
   inflected forms as input and returns base forms (constrained by
   inflection class information in the lexicon) as well as any morphemes
   that matched during analysis.  MORFOGEN can handle concatenative as
   well as non-concatenative morphology, and can be used for inflecting
   as well as agglutinating languages.  Analyzers using MORFOGEN have
   been written for English, French, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, Korean
   and Arabic.
