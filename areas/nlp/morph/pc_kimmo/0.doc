Name:         PC Kimmo

Summary:      Two-Level Processor for Morphological Analysis

Description:

   PC-Kimmo is a new implementation of a program dubbed KIMMO after its
   inventor Kimmo Koskenniemi (see Koskenniemi 1983). The program is
   designed to generate (produce) and/or recognize (parse) words using a
   two-level model of word structure in which a word is represented as a
   correspondence between its lexical level form and its surface level
   form. PC-Kimmo includes descriptions for English, Finnish, 
   Japanese, Hebrew, Kasem, Tagalog, and Turkish. 
   
   This directory contains PC-Kimmo and several related utilities:
   
     +  KGEN. A rule compiler for PC-Kimmo, written by Nathan Miles of
        Ohio State University.
   
     +  KTEXT. A text processor that uses the PC-KIMMO parser to produce a
        morphological parse of each word in the text.
   
     +  Englex. A 20,000 entry morphological parsing lexicon of
        English intended for use with PC-KIMMO and/or KTEXT.
