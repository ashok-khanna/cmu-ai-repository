Summary:      Phonological Programming Language

Version:      4.2.1 (18-DEC-91)

Description: 

   This directory contains Fonol, a programming language that
   simulates phonological rules of the sort described in Chomsky and
   Halle's "Sound Pattern of English" and Schane's "Generative Phonology". 
   It also incorporates the input and output filters (conditions) which came
   into common use at about the same time. These filters are currently
   restricted to the identification of a pattern and two actions:
   preventing the successful application of a specific rule or
   blocking (starring) the entire derivation.
