Well, I got a reply from the following when I ask the same question
a while back, I am still waiting for them to send the tape for

\section{International Phonetic Alphabet}

\subsection{Washington State University}

Dean Guenther informs me (June 22, 1988) that Washington State
University has an IPA font available. It contains 128 popular IPA
characters and diacritics as specified in the {\em Phonetic Symbol Guide\/} by
Geoffrey K.~Pullum and William A.~Ladusaw (Chicago, London, 1986).
Janene Winter did the MF work on this font.  The character positions
were coordinated with help from Helmut Feldweg at the
Max-Planck-Institut f\"{u}r Psycholinguistik in the Netherlands,
Christina Thiele at Carleton University and some ideas from Brian
MacWhinney at Carnegie Mellon and Karen Mullen at the University of
Kentucky at Louisville.

The font also comes with a set of macros to access the characters
easily.  For
example, \verb|\schwa| prints what you would expect.

\subsubsection{Terms of Availability}

The Washington IPA is available for \$100.  The package includes {\tt
GF}, {\tt PXL} or {\tt PK} fonts at 9, 10 and 12 point (together) in
the Roman face.    The typeface is designed to match the CM Roman
face.  The MF source is not included.

\subsection{Other Developments}

Georgia Tobin (q.\,v.) has an IPA font, created in old MF79.

A bitmap IPA font, {\tt ph10}, was created by Jean Pierre Paillet for
use with \TeX\ for typesetting the {\em Canadian Journal of Linguistics\/}.
This font is described, with a printout of the character grid, by
Christina Thiele in
\begin{description}
\item `\TeX, Linguistics, and Journal Production' in {\em \TeX\ Users Group\/}
{\em Eighth\/} {\em Annual Meeting: Conference Proceedings\/}, edited by Dean Guenther
(Providence: TUG, 1988), 5--26.
\end{description}
{\tt ph10} is now superseded by the Washington font.

According to a note from G.~Toal in UK\TeX\ 1988, issue 2, Tibor
Tscheke's company, St\"{u}rtze AG, also has an IPA font for sale.
Toal does not state whether this font was created with MF, but the
implication is that it is usable with \TeX.  Contact:\\

Kris Holmes and Chuck Bigelow also report that they have a bitmap IPA
font. See {\bf Lucida}.

%\paragraph{Date of information}  June 7, 1988.

\subsection{Ridgeway}

A phonetic alphabet has been developed by Thomas Ridgeway for a large
subrange  of American Indian languages.  The first active projects
using this are in  Salish and Navajo.  This font is presently being
tested and will be available  from the Humanities and Arts Computing
Center at the University of Washington  in early fall 1988.
