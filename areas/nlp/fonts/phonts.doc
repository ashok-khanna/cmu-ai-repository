Phonetics symbol set fonts for the HP Laserjet and Word Perfect 5.1 printer
and screen drivers.  Distributed on one disk in three files:
README.1ST, FONTS.EXE, DRIVERS.EXE.

This version has substantially revised printer and screen drivers
including support for the HP LJ III.  Make sure that any old version of this
system is deleted before installing the new one.

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:  MS(PC, DR)-DOS computer with a hard disk (about 1MB
of free space) connected to a HP Laserjet series II, IIP, IID, III, IIIP or
compatible (an extra 1MB of printer memory is recommended but not required).
These fonts will not work properly with earlier Laserjets such as the Plus.
They will not work in conjunction with a Postscript cartridge.
Some printers claiming 100% compatibility with HP LJ II have been found not
to be when attempting to use these fonts.
To get the phonetics characters on the screen you need a Hercules Graphics
Card Plus (regular Hercules is not enough), EGA, or VGA.  However, you do not
need any of these graphics adaptors to use the printer fonts.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Word Perfect 5.1 is required to use the printer drivers
and screen fonts.  The printer fonts may be used with other word processors,
but you will have to create your own drivers.


THE FILES
---------
FONTS.EXE
A self-extracting archive containing the phonetics fonts. Copy this file into
your printer fonts subdirectory and type FONTS at the DOS prompt.
Creates 15 font files, 390k.

DRIVERS.EXE
A self-extracting archive containing the Word Perfect 5.1 printer and screen
drivers for use with the phonetics fonts.  Copy it into your Word Perfect
subdirectory and type DRIVERS at the DOS prompt.
Creates 15 files, 590k:

Printer drivers:
 PHPRINT1.ALL
 HLSEIIPH.PRS for the series II
 HPLAIIPH.PRS for the IIP (and IID)
 HPLIIIPH.PRS for the III (and IIIP)

Screen drivers:
 HRF6.FRS and HRF6.CHM phonetics ramfont and character map for the Hercules
   Graphics Card Plus.

 PHONETIC.FNT the 4k version of HRF6.FRS.  If you need to use the screen
    fonts outside of Word Perfect, put this into your Hercules subdirectory.
    Note that this is a small subset (79 phonetics characters) of the set
    available in HRF6.FRS.

 VGA512.FRS, VGA512.CHM, VGABASE.FRS, VGABASE.VRS phonetics screen drivers
    for VGA.

 EGA512.FRS, EGA512.CHM, EGABASE.FRS, EGABASE.VRS phonetics screen drivers
    for EGA.

You may delete DRIVERS.EXE and FONTS.EXE after all their files are extracted.

I've included only the portrait fonts.  You don't need the landscape fonts with
the IIP, IID, or III, which can rotate fonts themselves.  If you want the
landscape fonts, send me another disk.

NB: Because WP printer drivers allow more characters to be defined than the
text screen drivers, there are some characters that will print but do not
show up properly on the screen (especially in character maps 6 and 10).  Also
a number the rarer special characters will print only in the 12pt Tms.
These appear in character maps 4 and 6.  Look at CHARMAP.TST on the
screen and print it in various sizes to see all the correspondences.




SETTING UP WORDPERFECT TO WORK WITH THE PHONETICS FONTS
-------------------------------------------------------
Before attempting to install these drivers make sure that any old version
of PHPRINT.ALL is deleted.

SUMMARY:  Within WP select the printer by selecting the appropriate .PRS file
(shift-F7,S,A,L), then tell WP what directory the fonts are in.  Select the
text screen driver using Setup (shift-F1,D,T,C).  Initialize the printer
(shift-F7,I) then retrieve and print CHARMAP.TST to see the full range of
characters.


DETAILED STEPS:  The following steps will be especially helpful if you've had
little experience in setting up WP 5.1.

Printer Drivers
---------------
  After you've transferred the fonts and drivers to the proper subdirectories
on your hard disk, the following steps will set up Word Perfect to work with
them.  First enter Word Perfect from your WP subdirectory.

1.  Shift-F7 (Printer menu)
2.  S  (Select printer)
3.  A  (Additional printers)
4.  L  (List printer files)
5.  Move cursor to HPLIIIPH.PRS if you use a LaserJet III
                   HPLAIIPH.PRS if you use a IIP or IID (or II compatible)
                   HLSEIIPH.PRS if you use the older series II
6.  hit Return (a message about the selected driver will be displayed)
7.  F7 (Exit to the Printer Edit menu)
8.  D (to enter the fonts directory)
9.  type the full name of the subdirectory that you put the fonts into
    (e.g. C:\WP51\FONTS)
10.  F7  (Exit to the Printer Edit menu)
11.  F7  (Exit to the Select Printer menu)
12.  move cursor to the selected printer
13.  hit Return (exit to the Print menu)
14.  G (to select graphics mode)
15.  N (Do not print special internal WP graphics (it's very slow))
16.  I (Initialize the printer)
17.  Y (Yes, confirm initialization)

  Steps 16-17 download the fonts from the hard disk to the printer.  The
fonts stay in the printer until it is turned off.  You must initialize the
printer each time you turn it on if you want to use the phonetics fonts.

  At this point (back at the main editing screen) retrieve (F5)
CHARMAP.TST, which comes with Word Perfect.  Use "Shift-F8 3 3" or
"Ctrl-F8 4" to select a phonetics font.  Then use "Shift-F7 1" to print
the file.

  CHARMAP.TST shows the full range of characters available with a
particular font.  These printouts also show the WP character code you
need to use to get a special character.  For example, the 57th character
of character map 1 in the printout of CHARMAP.TST, you will see, is a
schwa.  Thus, entering "Ctrl-V  1,57 Return" at the main editing screen
will enter a character that will print as a schwa.



Screen Drivers
--------------
If your computer has VGA, EGA, or Hercules Graphics Card Plus you can get
the phonetics characters on the screen.

Start Word Perfect.

For Hercules Plus:
1.  Shift-F1  (Setup)
2.  D (Display)
3.  T (Text screen type)
4.  move cursor to "Hercules Ramfont"
5.  hit Return
6.  move cursor to "80x25 mono save 4k font in WP"
7.  hit Return
8.  F7 back to "Setup: Display" menu
9.  C (Colors, Fonts and Attributes)
10.  3 (Select the 6x512 option)
11.  F7 (Exit back to the editing screen)

For VGA or EGA:
1.  Shift-F1  (Setup)
2.  D (Display)
3.  T (Text screen type)
4.  move cursor to "User defined base font" for VGA or EGA
5.  hit Return
6.  move cursor to "80x25 16 base font"
7.  hit Return
8.  F7 back to "Setup: Display" menu
9.  C (Colors, Fonts and Attributes)
10.  5 (512 characters)
11.  F7 (Exit back to the editing screen)

Now retrieve CHARMAP.TST.  You should see phonetics characters in maps
0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.


Keyboard note:  This software does not remap the keyboard.  To make entry
of special characters easier you can use WP's macro definition facility to
assign ctrl-v sequences to alt keys.  There are a number of keyboard
remapping programs (also known as keyboard macro programs) on the market such
as Prokey and Superkey which work well with WP and these fonts.  I especially
recommend Keyswap, which is distributed by SIL and is very inexpensive.
