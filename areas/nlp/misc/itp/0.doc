Summary:      Interlinear Text Processor

Version:      1.1c (11-SEP-91)

Description: 

   The IT ('eye-tee' for Interlinear Text) software has been developed by
   the Summer Institute of Linguistics to give linguists, literary
   scholars, translators, and anthropologists a tool for developing a
   corpus of annotated interlinear text. The centerpiece of IT is a
   program called itp--an interactive and automated interlinear text
   processor.  Itp insures consistency in text analysis by retrieving
   interlinear word and morpheme annotations from an on-line database of
   lexical information which it maintains.  The interlinear text file
   produced by itp is a clean ASCII file which is accessible by other
   text processing software for purposes such as concordancing, indexing,
   or display formatting. In addition to itp, the IT package includes a
   collection of other software tools which support the conversion of
   conventional texts to interlinear text format and which support the
   maintenance of the auxiliary lexical database files.  Many interlinear
   text processing systems support only a fixed, two-line model of
   interlinear text.  IT views text as a sequence of text units, each of
   which contains a text line plus a multidimensional set of annotations
   entered according to a model provided by the analyst.  In addition to
   word and morpheme level annotations, the IT system supports freeform
   annotations of the whole text unit, such as translations.
