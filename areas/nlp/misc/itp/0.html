The IT ('eye-tee' for Interlinear Text) software has been developed by
the Summer Institute of Linguistics to give linguists, literary
scholars, translators, and anthropologists a tool for developing a
corpus of annotated interlinear text. The centerpiece of IT is a
program called itp--an interactive and automated interlinear text
processor.  Itp insures consistency in text analysis by retrieving
interlinear word and morpheme annotations from an on-line database of
lexical information which it maintains.  The interlinear text file
produced by itp is a clean ASCII file which is accessible by other
text processing software for purposes such as concordancing, indexing,
or display formatting. In addition to itp, the IT package includes a
collection of other software tools which support the conversion of
conventional texts to interlinear text format and which support the
maintenance of the auxiliary lexical database files.  Many interlinear
text processing systems support only a fixed, two-line model of
interlinear text.  IT views text as a sequence of text units, each of
which contains a text line plus a multidimensional set of annotations
entered according to a model provided by the analyst.  In addition to
word and morpheme level annotations, the IT system supports freeform
annotations of the whole text unit, such as translations.
