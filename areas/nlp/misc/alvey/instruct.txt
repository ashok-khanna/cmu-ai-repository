Instructions for Anonymous FTP of the Alvey Natural Language Tools
------------------------------------------------------------------
(Release 4) from Cambridge University Computer Laboratory
---------------------------------------------------------


The Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) are held in the directory
`nltools' on the FTP server ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk (128.232.0.56).
The files containing grammars, lexicons, source code and full system
documentation are encrypted; to extract these you will need to use a
machine running Unix, and also to have been issued with a decryption key.
However, technical reports describing the ANLT are available in
non-encrypted form; you may freely fetch these for examination.


Fetching the Reports
--------------------

To fetch the reports use anonymous FTP (login with user name anonymous,
and password your e-mail address), go to the directory `nltools/reports',
get a list of the files in it, and fetch the ones you are interested in, or
all of them. The file `README' says what each of the files contains.
You could do this by:

$ ftp ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk
Connected to swan.cl.cam.ac.uk.
220- swan.cl.cam.ac.uk FTP server (Version 5.60+UA) ready.
...
Name (ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:jac): anonymous
Password (ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:anonymous): <type your e-mail address here>
...
ftp> cd nltools/reports
250 CWD command successful.
ftp> ls
...
README
gde.ps
grammar.ps
morph.plain
...
ftp> get gde.ps
...
ftp> get morph.plain
...
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

(The $ is the Unix shell command prompt). If the FTP command does not
know about the address ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk, try giving the command the
internet number (128.232.0.56) instead. The file 'morph.plain' is ASCII
text and so may be viewed or printed out just as it is. The files
whose names end in '.ps' are Postscript. The full ANLT system contains
the original (LaTeX format etc.) versions of these documents.
 

Fetching the Full ANLT System
-----------------------------

To fetch the full ANLT system from the server use anonymous FTP (login with
user name anonymous, and password your e-mail address), go to the directory
`nltools' and, in `binary mode', fetch three files:

1. the program to decrypt the ANLT; depending on the type of machine
you are using, one of
   
   decrypt.sun3          for Sun 3
   decrypt.sun4          for Sun 4 or Sun Sparc
   decrypt.hpux          for Hewlett Packard 9000/3nn running HP-UX
   decrypt.mips.ultrix   for DECStation 3000 or 5000 series running Ultrix
   decrypt.tar           for any other type of Unix machine,

2. some encrypted data to check that you have decryption working
properly; depending on the type of machine you are using when you
decrypt it, either

   test.l   for `little-endian' machines (DEC Vax, MicroVax, DECStation), or
   test.b   for `big-endian' machines (virtually all other machines including
            Sun 3/4/Sparc, Hewlett Packard, Sequent, IBM RISC, 80386),

3. the ANLT itself; depending on the type of machine you are using
when you decrypt it, either

   anlt4.tar.Zl   for `little-endian' machines
   anlt4.tar.Zb   for `big-endian' machines

IT IS VITAL that you fetch all of these files in binary mode. For
example, on a Sun 3 (a `big-endian' machine) you would do the following:

$ ftp ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk
Connected to swan.cl.cam.ac.uk.
220- swan.cl.cam.ac.uk FTP server (Version 5.60+UA) ready.
...
Name (ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:jac): anonymous
Password (ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:anonymous): <type your e-mail address here>
...
ftp> cd nltools
250 CWD command successful.
ftp> binary
200 Type set to I.
ftp> get decrypt.sun3
...
ftp> get test.b
...
ftp> get anlt4.tar.Zb
...
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

Make sure that the three files you have just fetched are in the disc
directory that you want the ANLT to finally end up in, and that this is
your current directory. If not, move them there and `cd' to it.

If you fetched the file `decrypt.tar' (because your machine is not one
of the four types for which the decryption program is already set up),
then you will have to `untar' the file and compile the program in it
using the Unix `make' command. When this is done, the decryption
program will be in a file called `decrypt':

$ tar xvf decrypt.tar
...
$ make
...

You will now have the decryption program in an executable form (in a
file called one of `decrypt.sun3', `decrypt.sun4', `decrypt.hpux',
`decrypt.mips.ultrix' or `decrypt'). Next, mark it as actually
executable, and run it to check that it is working properly using the
encrypted test data file, quoting the decryption key that was issued
to you. The decryption key is case-sensitive so you must type the
upper- and lower-case letters and numbers EXACTLY as they were given.

$ chmod +x decrypt.sun3
$ decrypt.sun3 test.b test
Passwd: <type the decryption key here>
Verify: <type the decryption key here>
$ cat test
...

The contents of the file `test' which are displayed should be English
text. If the decryption program gave an error then it is likely that you
fetched a version of it that is unsuitable for your machine: either
fetch the correct one, or fetch the `decrypt.tar' file and compile
your own version of it. If the decryption program ran, but the text in
the `test' file is not readable, then you probably fetched the wrong
`-endian' version of the decrypted files for your machine, or typed
the decryption key incorrectly. Try decrypting the test data again,
typing the decryption key carefully; if still unsuccessful fetch the
opposite `-endian' files and try them.

The ANLT itself is contained in an encrypted compressed `tar' archive.
To extract the files in it, decrypt the file quoting the decryption
key, uncompress the result of that, and finally `untar' it:

$ decrypt.sun3 anlt4.tar.Zb anlt4.tar.Z
Passwd: <type the decryption key here>
Verify: <type the decryption key here>
$ uncompress -c anlt4.tar.Z | tar xvf -

This process will require approximately 13 megabytes of free disc
space. The decryption step may take up to an hour on a Sun 3 (less on
a faster type of machine), the uncompress and `untar' step a few
minutes. Once this is done you can delete the ANLT archive files and
the decryption program and test data:

$ rm anlt4* decrypt* test*

You will now have all the files that comprise the ANLT in your current
directory. They will occupy about 10 megabytes on disc. You may want
to make yourself the owner of the files; ask a Unix expert locally to
do this for you if you don't know how to. For instructions on what to
do next and on how to install the ANLT system, refer to the file
called README that will have just been created.
