ROOK

Rook is a system for authoring descriptive grammars in HyperCard for the Macintosh. 
It is a tool for interactively and incrementally developing a grammar description 
based on an interlinear text corpus (as produced by SIL's IT program). The resulting 
on-line descriptive grammar exploits the capacity of the computer to provide instant 
access to cross-referenced topics, text examples, explanations of morpheme glosses, 
and so on.

System requirements: HyperCard 2.0 or later, Mac system 6.0.5 or later.
SIL's IT (interlinear text) program is recommended.
