A program to demonstrate English verb forms
by John and Muriel Higgins

Version 1.1 for MSDOS - August 1992



WHAT IS VERBALIST?
       VERBALIST is a verb-building robot. So what? you may ask; as English
speakers we already know how to build verbs so why get a machine to do it for
us? The answer is that if we succeed in teaching a machine how to do something,
we come to understand better how we do it ourselves. VERBALIST is an attempt
to capture in a program everything an English speaker knows about forming verbs
and verb phrases. Play with it. See if you can catch it out (as you will sooner or
later). In the process you will be bringing to the surface all the subconscious
knowledge you have about how this part of the English language works. It is
often said that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it, and what you are
doing is, in a sense, teaching the machine by making it create phrases and seeing
if they are right.
       The program started life as a demonstration tool for foreign learners of
English who had problems with spelling past tenses. We asked learners to browse
through it, to enter all sorts of verbs, real or nonsense, in order to try out spelling
rules. Then they wanted to explore the weird oblique tenses and to know if
anyone might use them; we stretched our imagination to find possible contexts for
them.

DICTIONARY and NOTES
       To make it more useful, VERBALIST then acquired a small dictionary so that
the meanings of a verb could be displayed. As well as the meanings we supplied
it with the irregular forms of strong verbs (like see/saw/seen) and usage notes,
such as the fact that we say try to do when try means attempt but try doing when
try means experiment. We put in code numbers to pick out words which cannot
be made passive (like become or last). Then we found there was so much
likelihood of dispute that we had to distribute the dictionary program so that
people could add their own words or amend our entries where they disagreed
with them. The dictionary now has all the irregular verbs in English (try to prove
us wrong), but only about 300 other verbs, including a lot of the ones that begin
with A and B. In fact we will never be able to put in all the verbs of English, since
people invent new ones every day. (If you don't believe this, ask somebody where
they will be Christmassing next year. They will know what you mean even
though they have almost certainly never heard the verb to christmas before.)
       In the end we had found ourselves proving the rightness of Paul Roberts's
dictum: "The best reason for studying grammar is that grammar is fascinating."REGISTERING YOUR COPY

files, the QBASIC source code for VERBAL.EXE, and a version of the program
written in Visual Basic to run under Windows 3 (if it is finished by then).



USING VERBALIST
     When you start, VERBALIST displays a verb phrase on screen, eg: 
                 I walk.
together with a definition. The nine function keys, f1 to f9, allow you to change
the forms. If you press f1, the present/past switch, the display turns into:
                 I walked.
Also a note appears giving the rule for making walk past. If you now press f3, the
perfect aspect switch, the screen shows the past perfect:
                 I had walked.
F2 switches in a modal verb (such as can or must) or the emphatic form do. Notice
that the emphatic form is deselected as soon as you select perfect (f3) or
continuous (f4), and it changes from do to get if you select passive (f7). Why? Well,
you can't say *We do have finished or *She didn't be fired.
     F4 is the switch for simple, continuous, and going to, and f5 and f6 will
switch in extra perfect and continuous forms only if going to has been selected. F7
is the switch for active/passive, f8 for affirmative/negative, and f9 for
statement/question/question tag.
     As soon as any form is chosen which requires a 3rd person -S, an -ING
form or a past tense or past participle, a relevant rule will appear explaining what
the program has done to inflect the verb.
     If you try every possible combination of the switches, you will have created
292 different forms of a single verb. If you combine these with all the possible
pronoun and modal verb selections, you will have made 6132 different verb
phrases from a single verb.

THE NOTES BOX
     There will be a red NOTES box visible at the start of the program with a
message about using the function keys. This is removed as soon as a key is
pressed. It returns if the current verb has a relevant note attached to it. For
instance, the verbs happen and occur have notes about the types of subject that can
be used with them, and the verbs know, understand and believe are flagged as
statives, so that a  message is displayed in the notes box if you select continuous
(f4) with  any of them. If you try to select passive with an intransitive verb such
as arrive, you will get a warning message, and the whole verb phrase will be
printed in red to show that it is of doubtful grammatical status.

THE MENU
     The menu bar at the foot of the screen is active throughout. The choices are
          VERB  PRONOUN  MODAL  RULES  PRINT  QUIT
One of the choices is highlighted, and the bottom line of the display explains what
that option will do. You can select the highlighted option by pressing ENTER. You
can move the highlight by pressing the space bar or the arrow keys, and then
press ENTER when it is in the right place. Or you can just press the initial letter of
the choice you wish to make. If you press ESCAPE, you will get the rightmost
option on this menu or any sub-menu, which is normally the QUIT option.

VERB
     Choosing the VERB option prompts you to enter a new verb. You can enter
only one word; if you try to enter several words (eg a phrasal verb) then you are
prompted to try again. If you press ENTER on its own, the existing verb stays on
screen. If you enter a verb, it replaces the verb in the display box. The program
looks up the verb in the dictionary file for its meaning and any notes or usage
restrictions. If it finds the verb, the notes will be shown on screen when
appropriate; if it does not, the definition line appears as `to zzzz: unrecognised
verb'. Naturally  there is nothing to stop you from entering a nonsense verb and
seeing how the program inflects it; one can learn a lot about spelling that way.

MODAL and PRONOUN
       You can choose which modal verb to use via the bottom menu. The item
MODAL lets you choose between can, may, shall, will or must. The pronouns are
also selectable via the bottom menu from I, we, you, they, she, he or it. 

RULES
     This option brings in a sub-menu as follows:
SPELLING FUTURE PERFECT CONTINUOUS STATIVE PASSIVE TRANSITIVE
Each of these brings up a notes page. The SPELLING page shows all the relevant
spelling rules. If an -ING form is on screen, you see all the -ING spelling rules.
The same applies to -S endings and -ED endings. The other pages display notes
about grammatical terms and, in the case of STATIVE and TRANSITIVE, a list of
all the words in the dictionary of that particular type.

PRINT
     This option prints the current phrase and an explanation page. You can
choose whether to have the printout on paper via your default printer or on an
ASCII disk file, so that you can incorporate the page into a word-processed
document.

VERBALIST belongs to a type of program know as `exploratory' since its main use
is simply as something to be explored. For a discussion of exploratory programs
and their relevance in language learning, see

     The following is the complete set of spelling rules which the program uses
and reports. The order of the rules is a rough reflection of the program's logic;
imagine them being applied in sequence until a match is made with the base form
of the verb. Thus the final -e in CANOE will not be deleted by rule 10, since rule
8 will already have applied, giving CANOEING. Syllables are counted by an
algorithm which alternately hunts for the next vowel or the next consonant. This
yields the correct result in most cases, but it will be fooled by words such as
REAPPEAR, which will be analysed as two syllables. The program treats QU as
one consonant rather than as consonant + vowel, and distinguishes consonantal
from syllabic Y.

S-ending rules

1: change HAVE to HAS (irregular)
2: double the last letter and add ES if the verb has less than 3 syllables and ends
     in one vowel plus S or Z
3: add ES if the verb ends in S, X, Z, SH, CH, or consonant + O  
4: change Y to IES if the verb ends in consonant plus Y 
5: add S to verbs which do not end in S, SH, CH, consonant + Y or  consonant +
     O

ING-ending rules

6: add ING if the verb is only two letters long
7: change final IE to YING
8: add ING to verbs which end in EE, OE, YE or INGE
9: reverse the last two letters and add ING if the word ends in consonant + RE 
10: if a verb ends in E, delete it and add ING
11: add KING if the verb ends in vowel + C
12: add ING if the verb ends in two consonants or two vowels plus a consonant 
13: add ING to the verb if it ends in a vowel other than E or one of  the
     consonants F, H, J, Q, W, X or Y
14: add ING to verbs of three or more syllables
15: double the last letter and add ING if the verb has two syllables, ends
     consonant-vowel-consonant, and begins with a Latin prefix  
16: double the last letter and add ING if the verb has one syllable and ends
     consonant-vowel-consonant 
17: double the L and add ING to a two-syllable verb which ends  consonant-
     vowel-L 
18: add ING to a two-syllable verb ending in R, N, P or T with stress  on the first
     syllable
19: double the final consonant and add ING if the verb ends consonant-vowel-
     consonant and the last consonant is B, D, G, K, M, S, V or Z
ED-ending rules (Irregular verbs are first checked against the dictionary loaded
from the disk file.)

20: reverse the last two letters and add ED if the word ends in consonant + RE 
21: add D to any verb which ends in E
22: if the verb ends consonant-Y, change Y to IED
23: if the verb ends vowel-Y, add ED
24: add ED to a verb which ends with any vowel except E or with the consonants
     F, H, J, Q, W or X
25: add ED to verbs of three or more syllables
26: double the last letter and add ED if the verb has two syllables, ends consonant-
     vowel-consonant, and begins with a Latin prefix  
27: add ED to a two-syllable verb ending in R, N, P or T with stress on the first
     syllable
28: double the R and add ED if the verb ends in R preceded by a vowel other than
     E 
29: double the final consonant and add ED to a one-syllable verb which ends 
     consonant-vowel plus N or T
30: add KED if the verb ends in vowel + C
31: double the L and add ED to a two-syllable verb which ends consonant-vowel-
     L 
32: double the final consonant and add ED if the verb ends consonant-vowel-
     consonant and the last consonant is B, D, G, J, K, M, P, S, V or Z  
33: add ED if the verb ends in two consonants or two vowels plus a consonant
