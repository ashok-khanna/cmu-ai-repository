Summary:      Program for producing concordances of texts.

Version:      1.71

Description: 

   Conc is a program for producing concordances of texts. A concordance
   consists of a list of the words in the text with a short section of
   the context that precedes and follows each word. Conc also produces an
   index, consisting of a list of the distinct words in the text, each
   with the number of times it occurs and a list of the places where it
   occurs. Conc displays the original text, the concordance, and the
   index each in its own window. Clicking on a word in any one of the
   three windows causes the other two windows to display the entries for
   the same word.
