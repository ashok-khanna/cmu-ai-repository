SYNONAME

Names are a key entry point for researching and indexing historical
information.  However, the format and spelling of personal names vary
greatly from one institution to the next, reflecting traditional
differences in practice.  If historical information is to be compiled
or shared, matching different versions of personal names is a
necessity.  The computer program SYNONAME automatically matches many
possible forms of a single personal name by using an ordered sequence
of twelve algorithms for pattern matching that include both character-
and word-matching techniques.  The matched pairs of names are
considered to be "candidate matches" until confirmed by a human
name-authority editor.  Run against a merged file of artists' names
from museum collections data, the program performed with an accuracy
rate of 97.4% and an optimum efficiency rate of 90.8%.  Accuracy can
increase to nearly 99% at the expense of some efficiency.  The
concepts behind the algorithms and their imlpementation may be useful
to others merging data in different contexts.
