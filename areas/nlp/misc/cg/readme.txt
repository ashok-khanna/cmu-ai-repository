This is a program written in the general-purpose utility 
language   yacc .  It is a linear parser of Conceptual Graphs 
as written in Robert Sowa's book _Conceptual Graphs_ .  It has
been tested by Roger T. Hartley of the Computing Research Lab 
of NMSU and found to work on these graphs.  It was made available
by its author, Maurice Pagnucco (in Norman Foo's group).
  A similar program in COMMON LISP has been written by Roger 
T. Hartley of the Computing Research Lab of NMSU for parsing 
Extended Conceptual Graphs.  (Due to be finished by Sept. 10  1991.)
