   concordances and supporting documents.  Both keyword in context and
   keyword and line generators are provided, as well as exclusion
   routines, a reverse concordance module, formatting programs, a
   dictionary maker, and lemmatization facilities.  There are also word,

   tabulation routines, a cross reference generator, and other related
