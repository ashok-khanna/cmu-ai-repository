This directory contains two files connected with a demo for the
Linguistic DataBase program, a database system for syntactic analysis
trees.

  ldbdemoc.inf           information and instructions
  ldbdemoc.exe           self-extracting zip with the actual demo
                         (ftp in binary mode and read ldbdemoc.inf
                         for extraction instructions)

Both files are in MS-DOS format. The demo runs only from the C: drive
of an MS-DOS machine.
