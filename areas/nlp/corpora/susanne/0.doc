Description: 

   This directory contains a copy of the SUSANNE Corpus (Surface and
   Underlying Structural Analysis of Naturalistic English). This corpus
   is an annotated sample comprising about 130,000 words of written
   American English text. The corpus is intended to exemplify a set of
   annotation standards which attempt to specify an explicit notation for
   all aspects of the surface and logical grammar of real-life English in
   sufficient detail that analysts independently applying the standards
   to the same text must produce identical annotations. The texts of the
   SUSANNE Corpus are a subset of the texts included in the (unannotated)
   Brown University Corpus.
