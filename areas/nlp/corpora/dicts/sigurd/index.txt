Subject: Proposed index definition for standardized dictionaries
Newsgroups: comp.ai,comp.ai.nat-lang,comp.compression,comp.compression.research,sci.crypt
Organization: GTE

As an aid to those involved in natural language parsing, dictionary
compression, foreign language translation, or textual encryption, I
have been collecting and compiling a lengthy list of words.  It is
expected that a comprehensive standardized dictionary will eventually
result.  This dictionary should contain most common American words,
abbreviations, acronyms, hyphenations, and even incorrect spellings.

This draft will document the proposed index structure used to access
the standardized dictionary.  Comments and criticisms are welcome.

'Words' are to be sorted by length, stored in ascending ASCII
collating sequence and normalized to lower case where possible to save
space.  Words containing unusual capitalization - other than all
lower, all upper, or first letter raised - will be represented as a
separate unique entry in the dictionary.

It is anticipated that a comprehensive dictionary can be compiled from
words addressed within a space of 1 MB (2^^20 or 1,048,576).  The
index will be comprised of 32 bits arranged in the following format:

   _________________________________________________________________
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|3|3|
   |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|
   |        dictionary index               |  form |    language   |

The lower 20 bits (0-19) are used as pointers to entries in the
dictionary.  The following 4 bits (20-23) will be used to indicate a
variance on the form of the word, and the last 8 bits (24-31) will be
used for future expansion to specify one of 256 dictionaries
corresponding to various languages or personalized dictionaries.

The data collection process has produced statistics indicating that
the average word length is centered around 8 characters resulting in a
1 M word dictionary approximately 8 MB in length.  Encoding common
capitalization and endings will allow the storage requirements to
remain manageable and within the capacity and capability of even low
end computer systems in terms of resource utilization and performance.
Accordingly, the form bits are interpreted as follows:

   bits 20 and 21 determine case

      00 default case (as stored in dictionary)
      01 all lower case
      02 all upper case
      03 first letter capitalized, rest lower case

   bits 22 and 23 determine the ending

      00 default ending
      01 ends with a period
      02 ends with a question mark
      03 ends with a line termination character or characters

By way of further defining the dictionary index field, bits 16-19 will
be used as a flag to indicate simple ASCII encoding or ASCII with run
length encoding.  When bits 16-19 equal zero, ASCII and extended ASCII
or binary data will be represented by the lowest eight bits with the
run length represented by bits 8 - 15 as follows:

   _________________________________________________________________
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|2|3|3|
   |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|0|1|
   |  ASCII        |  run length   |0|0|0|0|                       |

For a single ASCII character, the run length field would equal 1.
When the run length field is also set to equal 0, the lowest eight
bits represent the index version number which will be used to
correlate with the appropriate dictionary.

Since this technique essentially 'wastes' the first 65,536 entries in
the dictionary, this space will be redefined and utilized to specify
the initial index for each length of entry.  A further implication is
that the first dictionary entry corresponds to index position 65,537.

Index entries 0 and 1 have no meaning within this context, entries 2
through 31 will point to values in a table which correspond to the
location and length of the 31 word list files.  As an implementation
dependent alternative, all dictionary entries would be stored in a
single file with the index pointing to the beginning of records with
like lengths.

The physical architecture of the dictionary will depend on the
hardware/software platform and may be implemented as a table in ROM, a
single file, or multiple files which may or may not contain line
termination characters.

Take care.
