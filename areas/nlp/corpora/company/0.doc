Summary:      List of company names and country of origin

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a list of over 50,000 corporations and
   their country of origin.  The format is: COMPANY | COUNTRY
   All of the companies with UNITED STATES as their origin came off of
   the Compact Disclosure disk "Corporate Information on Public
   Companies Filing with the SEC."  All other names came off the
   National Trade Data Bank, distributed by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   It appears that the string "XXXX S" should be interpreted as "XXXX'S"
   However, this is not always the case.
