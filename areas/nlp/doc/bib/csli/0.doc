Version:      1.0 (20-JUL-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains CSLI's 3,300 entry linguistics bibliography
   database in bib/tib/refer format. It is heavily slanted towards
   phonetics/phonology but with a fair amount of morphology, syntax, and
   semantics thrown in, especially if your interests are computational.

   Contributions are welcome, but should be in tib format.
