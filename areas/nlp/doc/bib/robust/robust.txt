There is a lot of literature regarding robust parsing of nl.  For
corrective approaches, look at Computational Linguistics 9.  These
systems try to map some sentence that the grammar cannnot generate
ito something that it can.  For grammar learning approaches, look
at the corpus linguistics literature for stochastic  approaches, or 
at the machine learning lit. for their symbolic cousins.  Here are
a few examples:

My thesis (currently being written!) deals with grammar learning for
natural language (end of plug).

Hope this helps
