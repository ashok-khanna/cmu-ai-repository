This directory contains versions of Robert Dale's Natural Language
Generation bibliography.

The files are compressed PostScript, so you will have to retrieve them
using binary mode in ftp.

The filename of each file indicates (a) the version number of the
file, and (b) what output paper size is assumed: thus

	nlgbiblio2.01a4.ps.Z

is a compressed, PostScript version of version 2.01 of the biblio, and
is for printing on A4 sized paper.  Here's a list of version numbers
and dates in case that should be useful.

	Version		Date
	2.01		14th March 1993

A US paper-sized version will appear eventually: if you're eager to
see one, you could help by emailing me a style file that makes
sensible use of the page on US paper.  The A4 version is usable on US
paper, but you will have unbalanced margins and lose parts of the page
numbers.

If you have any problems printing the PostScript file, I'd be
interested to know.  I've already had one report that it won't print
on an LPS-40.

The directory also contains the LaTeX source to an earlier annotated
bibliography, in the file "IntroToNLG-RefList.tex".

Robert Dale,
