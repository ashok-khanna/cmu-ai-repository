Name:         NATHAN (Spec13)

Summary:      Argues defeasibly in first-order logic.

Version:      19-FEB-94

Description: 

   Nathan (specs1-13) is a relatively fast implementation of a defeasible
   reasoner with specificity.  It uses arguments of the kind described in
   [1,2] and its specificity comparator (LMNOP) is described in [3] which
   is a modification of the criterion of Poole.

   It solves all basic benchmark problems to the author's satisfaction.
   Its limitations in planning applications are due to the limits of its
   underlying resolution-refutation linear-input set-of-support
   theorem-prover for FOL.

   It includes a predicate for unique names.  It includes a perl
   preprocessor for extracting rules from cases.
