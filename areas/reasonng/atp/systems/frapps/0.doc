Summary:      Framework for Resolution-based Automated Proof Procedures

Version:      2.0 (27-JUN-92)

Description: 

   FRAPPS (Framework for Resolution-based Automated Proof Procedures) is
   a portable resolution theorem-prover written in Common Lisp. 

   It facilitates the construction of a wide variety of resolution-based
   deductive systems.  FRAPPS offers the basic functionality necessary to
   build such systems, freeing users from low-level implementation
   concerns.  It is not intended for use in the construction of
   high-performance theorem provers, but rather to provide a modular and
   customizable system useful for rapid prototyping and experimentation
   in teaching and research.  An extension to FRAPPS, called "Hooked on
   FRAPPS" or "Constraints in FRAPPS" enables the introduction of
   specialized unification procedures and constraints.
