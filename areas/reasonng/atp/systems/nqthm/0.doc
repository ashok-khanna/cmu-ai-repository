Name:         NQTHM

Summary:      The Boyer-Moore theorem prover.

Version:      1992 (January 1994)

Description: 

   This directory contains Nqthm-1992, the Boyer-Moore theorem prover.
   The 1992 version of the theorem prover is upwardly compatible with the
   previous (1987) version. Included in the distribution are thousands of
   Nqthm-checked theorems formulated by Bevier, Boyer, Brock, Bronstein,
   Cowles, Flatau, Hunt, Kaufmann, Kunen, Moore, Nagayama, Russinoff,
   Shankar, Talcott, Wilding, Yu, and others. The release of Nqthm-1992
   includes three revised chapters of the book `A Computational Logic
   Handbook', including Chapter 4, on the formal logic for which the
   system is a prover, and Chapter 12, the reference guide to user
   commands.

   PC-NQTHM is Matt Kaufmann's interactive proof-checking enhancements to
   Nqthm-1992. 

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Nqthm has been tested in AKCL, CMU CL, Allegro CL, Lucid
              CL, MCL, and Symbolics CL.
