Package:      areas/reasonng/atp/systems/elf/

Name:         Elf

Summary:      LF Logical Framework

Version:      0.4 (1-JUL-93)

Description: 

   Elf implements the LF Logical Framework (based on the theory of
   dependent types) and gives it a logic programming interpretation in
   order to support search and the implementation of other algorithms (e.g.
   evaluation or compilation in programming languages).  It comes with a
   number of examples from logic and the theory of programming languages
   such as the Church Rosser theorem for the untyped lambda-calculus and
   type soundness for Mini-ML. It includes some support code for
   editing and interaction in GNU Emacs.
