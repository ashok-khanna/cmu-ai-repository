Version 0.4 of Elf fixes some bugs in Version 0.3.  It also provides an
improved Emacs interface to Elf: terms are marked with their source location
during parsing and error messages during lexing, parsing, or type
reconstruction are labelled with an error location.  The Emacs Elf mode
interprets these messages and can jump to the indicated error location.
elf-examples did not change at all, and elf-tools changed only in one
line.
