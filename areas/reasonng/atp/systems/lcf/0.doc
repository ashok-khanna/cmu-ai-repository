Summary:      Automated generic theorem prover

Version:      1.5 (25-AUG-92) 

Description: 

   Cambridge LCF (Logic for Computable Functions) is an interactive
   theorem prover.  Proofs are conducted in PPLAMBDA, a natural deduction
   logic based on the domain theory of Dana Scott.  PPLAMBDA is
   particularly suitable for proofs involving denotational semantics,
   lazy evaluation, or higher-order functions.  LCF provides a
   metalanguage (Standard ML), a functional programming language whose
   values include PPLAMBDA terms, formulas, and theorems.
   Theorem-proving primitives such as inference rules, subgoaling
   strategies (tactics), and simplifiers are implemented as ML functions.
   The user can extend LCF by programming in ML. 

   [LCF is an obsolete system.]
