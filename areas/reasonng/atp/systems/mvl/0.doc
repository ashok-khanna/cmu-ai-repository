Summary:      Multi-Valued Logic

Version:      19-AUG-93

Description: 

   This directory contains MVL (Multi-Valued Logic), a theorem proving
   shell written in Common Lisp.  It includes first-order logic, ATMS,
   default reasoning and circumscription as special cases.

   MVL is a bilattice-based reasoning system.  By changing the
   bilattice, you can use MVL to do truth maintenance, nonmonotonic
   reasoning, first-order reasoning, and a variety of other reasoning
   strategies.
