Summary:      Tools for Building Theorem Provers

Version:      1.1 (10-OCT-93)

Description: 

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.

   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. 

   KEIM also provides functionality for the pretty-printing, error
   handling, formula parsing and user interface facilities which form a
   large part of any theorem prover. Implementing with KEIM thus allows
   the programmer to avoid a great deal of drudgery.

   The KEIM architecture, based on CLOS (Common Lisp Object System),
   allows great flexibility in the integration of new classes of objects.
   The generic function paradigm allows one to specialize the behavior of
   a function on a new type of object without changing its behavior on
   existing objects and without having to rewrite existing code.

Requires:     Common Lisp, CLOS

Ports:        KEIM has been tested in Allegro CL 4.1 and Lucid CL 4.0
              on Sun4 workstations.
