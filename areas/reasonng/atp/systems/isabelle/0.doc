Summary:      Automated generic theorem prover

Version:      Isabelle 93 (16-DEC-93); Elle 2.4 (6-MAY-94)

Description: 

   Isabelle is a highly automated generic theorem prover written in
   Standard ML.  New logics are introduced by specifying their syntax and
   rules of inference.  Proof procedures can be expressed using tactics
   and tacticals. Isabelle comes with 8 different logics, including LCF,
   some modal logics, first-order logic, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and
   higher-order logic. Isabelle-93 is not upwardly compatible with its
   predecessor, but comes with advice on converting to the new
   simplifier.

   The Elle Verification Environment for ML (requires Isabelle-92),
   the archives of the isabelle-users mailing list, and Martin Coen's
   Substitutions system are included.
