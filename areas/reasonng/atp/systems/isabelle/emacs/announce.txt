Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Isabelle mode for GNU Emacs
Date: Tue, 08 Mar 94 16:51:43 GMT
From: David Aspinall <da@dcs.ed.ac.uk>

Dear Fellow Isabelle Users,

I've developed an Emacs Lisp package which provides some useful
facilities for Isabelle use.

The hope is that the package will help make the learning curve for new
Isabelle users less steep, whilst at the same time speeding up use for
experienced users.  More information follows below.

Briefly (more details below), the facilities provided are:

 * Theory mode    -  for editing theory files
 * Isabelle mode  -  for interacting with Isabelle
 * Menus          -  including tactics and common proof commands 
 * Listener       -  a buffer for recording interactive proofs
 * Proof-State    -  a buffer which displays the current proof state
 * Rule-table     -  rule names for the current logic

Menus and mouse functions give Isabelle a primitive user-interface.
They only work in the latest versions of Emacs - FSF GNU Emacs 19
(version 19.19 onwards) or Lucid GNU Emacs (version 19.6 onwards).

The package is also compatible with GNU Emacs version 18.59.

It is available by ftp from Edinburgh: 

        ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk  directory /pub/da 
        
        /pub/da/isa-mode           directory containing package
        /pub/da/isa-mode.tar.gz    compressed gzip'd tar file of above

The code hasn't been tested extensively yet, so this version should be
considered a beta-release for something more extensive and robust to
follow.  

Please try it out and tell me of any problems or suggestions.  Offers
of help from any Emacs hackers out there would be particularly
welcome!

 - David

----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Outline of Features provided by Isabelle Mode
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides editing and interaction functions for the
theorem prover Isabelle.  When used with FSF Emacs 19 or Lucid Emacs,
there is a system of menus and multiple windows.

Here's what you get:


 * Theory mode    -  for editing theory files

This mode understands the syntax for strings (automatic backslashes)
and allows convenient switching to sml-mode in the "ML" section of
theory files.  It provides templates to help remind you of the syntax
for theory files.  There is a master menu to start-up an Isabelle
session and view Isabelle documentation.


 * Isabelle mode  -  for interacting with Isabelle

Isabelle is run in a shell-like buffer, based on the latest Emacs
command-interpreter software.  This provides useful command history,
filename completion, tactic/tactical/command completion, and the usual
advantages of running Isabelle inside Emacs.  A collection of menus
for common proof commands are provided.  These insert command text
into the Isabelle buffer.  The interaction buffer can be used in
conjunction with other special buffers...


 * Listener       -  a buffer for recording interactive proofs

This receives a copy of the commands you type to Isabelle, to record
interactive proofs.  You can cut from this buffer and use
"isa-batchify" (previously called "goalify") to very easily create
batch proofs from interactive ones.  Future versions of isa-mode will
provide more advanced ways of using a "Listener"-like buffer, so that,
for example, undo() commands may be interpreted.


 * Proof-State    -  a buffer which displays the current proof state

This buffer maintains the display of the current proof state, removing
it from the output in the Isabelle interaction buffer.  The cursor
keys can be used in this buffer to page back through previous levels
of the proof, or select a "denoted" subgoal for the menu-driven tactic
commands to use.


 * Rule-table     -  rule names for the current logic

This buffer displays a formatted table of rule names for the logic in
use.  Mouse-clicking (or key-pressing in Emacs 18) on a rule name
inserts it into the Isabelle interaction buffer, or displays the 
rule (as "prth" would) in a temporary buffer.


In Emacs 19 varieties, each of the Isabelle interaction related
buffers can appear in a separate X-window.  In non-window
environments, the pull-down menus degenerate to Emacs commands, and
the special buffers are displayed in split Emacs "windows".
