Description: 

   Otter (Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective
   Research) is a resolution-style theorem-proving program for
   first-order logic with equality.  Otter includes the inference rules
   binary resolution, hyperresolution, UR-resolution, and binary
   paramodulation.  Some of its other abilities are conversion from
   first-order formulas to clauses, forward and back subsumption,
   factoring, weighting, answer literals, term ordering, forward and back
   demodulation, evaluable functions and predicates, and Knuth-Bendix
   completion.
