<H2>Otter: Resolution-based theorem prover.</H2>

<listing>
Otter (Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective
Research) is a resolution-style theorem-proving program for
first-order logic with equality.  Otter includes the inference rules
binary resolution, hyperresolution, UR-resolution, and binary
paramodulation.  Some of its other abilities are conversion from
first-order formulas to clauses, forward and back subsumption,
factoring, weighting, answer literals, term ordering, forward and back
demodulation, evaluable functions and predicates, and Knuth-Bendix
completion.
