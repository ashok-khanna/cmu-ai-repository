This is a DOS version of Otter 3.0.1.  It contains essentially
the same material as the ordinary (UNIX) version, including
source code, the manual, and many test problems.  The DOS version
also contains an executable file that was compiled with djgpp
(the DOS version of gcc).  It contains its own memory extender.
A 386 or 486 is required.  A floating point emulator is included
in case you don't have floating point hardware.

Otter 3.0.1 is free, with no restrictions on usage or copying.

Obtaining and installing otter.  Anonymous FTP from info.mcs.anl.gov
in directory pub/Otter.  The files to fetch are

    DOSOT301.TXT  --  a short introduction (this file??)
    DOSOT301.EXE  --  a self-extracting compressed archive

If you receive a floppy, it should contain the above two files.

(Later versions will be DOSOT302, DOSOT303, ... .)

The self-extracting compressed archive was created (in DOS) with LHA 2.13
as follows:

    LHA A /RX DOSOT301 OTTER301\*.*  (this created DOSOT301.LZH)
    LHA S /X DOSOT301                (this created DOSOT301.EXE)

To unpack, simply execute (in DOS) DOSOT301, which will create a
directory OTTER301 (in your current directory) containing all of the
Otter files and subdirectories.  You don't need the LHA program.  It
requires about 2.5 MB of disk space.

Once you have it unpacked, see OTTER301\README.DOS for more information.
