We don't yet have an Otter 3 distribution in a single archive file,
so this directory contains individual files.

Please let me know if these files are of use to you. (I'm not a Macintosh user).

Executable Otter 3.0.0:

    Otter_300a.hqx -- BinHex 4.0 version of Otter 3.0.0 (not tested by McCune).

Three versions of the manual:

    Manual_300.tex  --  LaTeX
    Manual_300.ps   --  PostScript
    Manual_300.tex  --  ASCII

Example input files:

    *.in
