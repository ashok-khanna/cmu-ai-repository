Summary:      Prototyping of Interactive Theorem Provers

Version:      Qu-Prolog 3.2 (7-DEC-93); Ergo 4.0 (9-DEC-93)

Description: 

   Qu-Prolog is a high-level language designed primarily for rapid
   prototyping of interactive theorem provers and, more generally, for
   symbolic computation on formal languages.  Its object level includes
   quantified terms and object variables.  As an example, the interactive
   theorem prover Ergo 4.0 is implemented in Qu-Prolog. The compactness
   and high level of Ergo 4.0 source code demonstrate the advantages of
   Qu-Prolog for such applications. Ergo includes a 'window inference'
   method that is specifically designed to support hierarchical
   goal-directed proofs and allow easy access to the context of a
   subterm. Ergo also provides support for defining a variety of logics
   and support for proving schematic theorems and answer extraction.
   Ergo is being used to support the development of verified software.
