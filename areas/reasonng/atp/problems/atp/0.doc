Summary:      ATP Problem Library

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a collection of ATP problems from Otter, CADE,
   and JAR. They may be used to testing and benchmarking theorem provers.
   The problems include algebra, analysis, circuits, geometry, logic
   problems, Pelletier's problem set, program verification, puzzles, set
   theory, and topology. The problems are given in the form of Otter
   input files.
