                   The TPTP Problem Library, Release v1.1.3
                   ----------------------------------------

The tptp2X code in TPTP-v1.1.1 is broken. There is some developmental code left
unfinished,  causing  load errors,  and when  run in Eclipse  Prolog  erroneous 
output  is produced due to  a limit on  the term depth  when writing (it writes 
"..."  instead  of  terms beyond  some depth).  These  problems  have now  been 
corrected.  Further, a new transformation has been added, to randomly order the 
clauses and literals in a problem.  See the ReadMe file in the TPTP2X directory 
for more information.
* Note that files transformed by tptp2X of v1.1.1 may be flawed  (definitely if 
  you use Eclipse Prolog).

The tptp_convert script has been overhauled.  It can now transform all problems 
in the library to your favourite format, using a single command, e.g.,
    prompt> tptp_convert otter
will convert  all the  problems to Otter format.  (Note : You have to configure 
tptp2X before you  can use tptp_convert.)  Read the ReadMe file in  the Scripts 
directory for more information. 

Two problems have been bugfixed since v1.1.1.

TPTP-v1.1.3 can  be obtained by  anonymous ftp,  from either the  Department of 
Computer  Science,   James  Cook  University,  Australia   (coral.cs.jcu.edu.au 
[137.219.17.4]),   or  the  Institut  fuer  Informatik,  TU  Muenchen,  Germany 
(flop.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.8.35]).  At both sites the TPTP is  in 
the pub/tptp-library directory.

Convenient access  to the  TPTP is also  available through  the World Wide  Web
(WWW), using either of the following URLs :
    ftp://coral.cs.jcu.edu.au/web/cs/tptp.html
