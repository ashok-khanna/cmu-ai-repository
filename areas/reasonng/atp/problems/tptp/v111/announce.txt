The TPTP (Thousands  of Problems for  Theorem Provers)  Problem  Library  is  a
library of test problems  for automated theorem  proving (ATP)  systems,  using
the clausal normal form of 1st order logic. The TPTP supplies the ATP community
with :
+ A comprehensive library of the ATP test problems that are available today, in
  order to provide an overview and a simple, unambiguous reference mechanism.
+ A comprehensive list of references and other interesting information for each
  problem.
+ New  generalized variants  of problems  whose original presentation  is hand-
  tailored towards a particular automated proof.
+ A utility  to convert  the problems  to existing ATP  formats.  Currently the
  METEOR, MGTP, OTTER, PTTP, SETHEO,  and SPRFN formats are supported,  and the
  utility can easily be extended to produce any format required.
+ General guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system evaluation.

The principal motivation for this project is to move the testing and evaluation
of ATP systems from the present  ad hoc situation onto a firm footing.  This is
necessary,  as results  currently  being  published seldom provide  an accurate
reflection of the intrinsic power of the ATP system being considered.  A common
library of problems is necessary for meaningful system evaluations,  meaningful
system   comparisons,   repeatability  of  testing,   and  the   production  of
statistically significant results. The TPTP is such a library.

Release v1.1.1 of the TPTP is now available. TPTP v1.1.1 contains 2652 problems
in 25 domains. Here's what's new in v1.1.1 :
+ The domain  structure has been  extended by two  new domains in the  field of
  engineering: CID (CIrcuit Design) and CIV (CIrcuit Verification).
+ There are 357 new problems (320 new abstract problems).
+ There have been 738 bugfixes done.
+ The tptp2X  utility has been  substantially overhauled.  The utility  can now
  apply a  sequence of transformations  to clauses,  and installation has  been
  simplified.
+ A list of registered users is included in the Documents directory.
+ The  TPTP release  and the release  of the  last bugfix are now  given in the
  % File field of each problem and axiom set.

The  TPTP can  be obtained  by  anonymous  ftp from  either the  Department  of
Computer  Science,  James Cook  University,  Australia,  or the  Institut  fuer
Informatik,  TU Muenchen, Germany.  The ftp instructions are given below. There
are  three   files,  ReadMe-v1.1.1,  TPTP-v1.1.1.tar.gz,  and  TR-v1.1.1.ps.gz.
General information about the library is in the ReadMe-v1.1.1 file, the library
is packaged in  TPTP-v1.1.1.tar.gz, and a technical report describing  the TPTP
(in postscript form) is in TR-v1.1.1.ps.gz.  Please read the ReadMe file, as it
contains up-to-date information about the TPTP.  The technical report serves as
a manual explaining the structure and use of the TPTP. It also explains much of
the reasoning behind the development of the TPTP.
