BUILDING PROBLEM SOLVERS

Kenneth D. Forbus and Johan de Kleer

  For nearly two decades, Kenneth Forbus and Johan de Kleer have
accumulated a substantial body of knowledge about the principles and
practice of creating problem solvers. In some cases they are the
inventors of the ideas or techniques described, and in others,
participants in their development. BUILDING PROBLEM SOLVERS communicates
this knowledge in a focused, cohesive manner. It is unique among
standard artificial intelligence texts in combining science and
engineering, theory and craft to describe the construction of AI
reasoning systems, and it includes code illustrating the ideas.

  After working through BUILDING PROBLEM SOLVERS, readers should have a
deep understanding of pattern directed inference systems, constraint
languages, and truth-maintenance systems. The diligent reader will have
worked through several substantial examples, including systems that
perform symbolic algebra, natural deduction, resolution, qualitative
reasoning, planning, diagnosis, scene analysis, and temporal reasoning.
  
  Along the way Forbus and de Kleer teach the art of building robust AI
software. They begin with simple examples such as search programs, and
move to more complex cases on the cutting edge of AI techniques, such as
model-based diagnosis systems and a qualitative reasoner. This software
has been tested and used extensively by graduate students and
programmers in industry.
  
  Although BUILDING PROBLEM SOLVERS is designed primarily as a text for
advanced AI classes or AI programming classes, it can be used by
researchers in universities and industrial laboratories who want to
apply these techniques in their work, and by programmers who want to
incorporate these ideas in their applications.
  
  Kenneth D. Forbus is Professor of Computer Science and Education at
the Institute for Learning Sciences, Northwestern University. Johan de
Kleer directs the Systems and Practices Laboratory at the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center.
