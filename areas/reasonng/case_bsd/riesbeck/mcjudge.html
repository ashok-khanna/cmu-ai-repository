Subject: Error in MCJUDGE.MOPS

Dear fans of Schank and Riesbeck's micro programs:

playing with the Micro versions of the Yale programs, I noticed that  
in MicroJudge in file mcjudge.mops the following MOP is ill-defined.  
According to its specification, MOP M-ADAPT-MIXED-NEW is  
self-contradictory because the value of OLD-SEVERITY cannot be  
LESS-THAN itself. With respect to the intended meaning, the value of  
OLD-SEVERITY should be LESS-THAN the value of THIS-SEVERITY; the  
appropriate definition is given below. Maybe, some other students of  
the Micro versions will profit from this correction, and will not  
searching for this bug.


old> (DEFMOP M-ADAPT-MIXED-NEW (M-ADAPT-SENTENCE)
old>     (THIS-SEVERITY NIL)
old>     (OLD-SEVERITY M-LESS-THAN (TO OLD-SEVERITY))  ;; wrong
old>     (OLD-MOTIVE M-UNJUSTIFIED)
old>     (THIS-MOTIVE M-JUSTIFIED)
old>     (WEIGHT 0.00) (DIRECTION 1))

Sorry, I forgot to mention that the following MOP has additionally to
