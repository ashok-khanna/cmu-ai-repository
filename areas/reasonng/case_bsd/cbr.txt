This article was on the net a month or so ago. 

------------------------------
Paul Harmon's "Case-Based Reasoning III", published in 
Intelligent Software Strategies, VIII, 1, in 1992 seems to be the 
only survey on CBR-Tools in English. There, four shells are 
introduced: ART-IM/CBR Express (Inference,Tel.2133220200), ESTEEM (Esteem 
Inc., Tel. 317 478 3955), Induce-It (Inductive Solutions Inc., 
Tel. 212-945-0630) and ReMind (Cognitive Systems Inc., Tel. 617 
742 7227). Unfortunately, Harmon did not have the opportunity to 
gain practical experience with all of them.

Meanwhile, Induce-It was renamed to Case Power, and the price 
increased slightly from 900$ to 3500$ (MS-EXCEL needed in 
addition).

Recently, several other companies claimed to offer CBR tools, 
too:
Software Artistry (Tel. 317  876 3042) offers Expert Advisor 2.2 
for help-desk applications. The Haley Enterprise (Tel. 412 741 
6420) offers The Easy Reasoner, a CBR library for their Eclipse 
programming environment. Acknosoft (Tel. 415 326 2460) offers 
KATE-CBR inside their KATE Toolbox for reasoning from cases 
(including induction). Isoft (Tel. France 1 69 41 27 77) offers 
ReCall, a dedicated CBR shell that runs on Unix/Motif.

I reviewed ART-IM/CBR Express, ESTEEM, and ReMind for two German 
magazines. The collected reports including feature comparison 
tables are published as a research report of the University of 
Freiburg - but they are written in German. Anyone who does not 
mind can get a Postscript file by mail.

Additionally, there was an effort to implement a business 
consultation system for a classification task using these shells. 
A paper for the European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning (EWCBR-
93) on that gives also a qualitative assessment of the three 
shells mentioned above for the respective task. Again, this paper 
(this time written in English) can be mailed as a Postscript 
file.
