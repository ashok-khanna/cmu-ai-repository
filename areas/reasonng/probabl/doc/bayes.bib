7) Intros (or otherwise) to Bayesian reasoning:

        _Scientific Reasoning: The Bayesian Approach_
        C. Howson, P. Urbach, Open Court, 1989.

        _Theory of Probability_
        H. Jeffrys, Clarendon Press, 1961

        _Theory of Probability_ (2 volumes)
        B. De Finnitti, John Wiley and Sons, year unknown.


I also received a mondo-list of references that came from a search of
the 1992 on-line version of the Current Index to Statistics (CIS). The
search was done on the authors Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, and on the
keywords "graphical model" and "expert system".  Its too large to include
here but if anyone wants it, I'll mail it to them.  Warning: the CIS
uses abbreviations for the journals that may be hard to decipher.
