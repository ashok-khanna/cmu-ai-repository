Summary:      Graphical Belief Function Models and Graphical
              Probabilistic Models 

Version:      1.2 (6-MAR-92)

Description: 

   BELIEF is a Common Lisp implementation of the Dempster and Kong fusion
   and propagation algorithm for Graphical Belief Function Models and the
   Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter algorithm for Graphical Probabilistic
   Models. It includes code for manipulating graphical belief models such
   as Bayes Nets and Relevance Diagrams (a subset of Influence Diagrams)
   using both belief functions and probabilities as basic representations
   of uncertainty. It uses the Shenoy and Shafer version of the
   algorithm, so one of its unique features is that it supports both
   probability distributions and belief functions.  It also has limited
   support for second order models (probability distributions on
   parameters).

   Version 1.2 corresponds to CLtL2 and Version 1.1 to CLtL1.
