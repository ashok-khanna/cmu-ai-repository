Summary:      RHET Knowledge Representation System

Version:      21.30 (31-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains the knowledge tools distribution as maintained
   by the University of Rochester Computer Science Dept. RHETORICAL is
   a planning and knowledge tool. 

   This is a Knowledge Representation system based on concepts proved
   with HORNE, and follow James Allen's grand design for KR following his
   publications (in particular, see his book with Pelavin and Kautz).  It
   includes 2 major modes for representing knowledge (as Horn Clauses or
   as frames), which are interchangable; a type subsystem for typed and
   type restricted objects (including variables); E-unification;
   negation; forward and backward chaining; complete proofs (prove,
   disprove, find the KB inconsistent, or claim a goal is neither
   provable nor disprovable); contextual reasoning; truth maintenance;
   intelligent backtracking; full LISP compatibility (can call or be
   called by lisp); upward compatible with HORNE; Allen & Koomen's TEMPOS
   time interval reasoning subsystem; frames have KL-1 type features,
   plus arbitrary predicate restrictions on slots within a frame as well
   as default values for slots; separate subsystem providing
   user-interface facilities and ZMACS interface on the lispms.

   RHET is currently being rewritten into a new system called Shocker.
