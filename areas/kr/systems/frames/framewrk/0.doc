Name:         FrameWork

Summary:      Generic Frame System

Version:      2.1 (18-MAR-93)

Description: 

   FrameWork is a Common Lisp portable frame-based knowledge
   representation language. It combines some of the better features of a
   variety of other frame languages. It includes a variety of tools for
   building, examining, and using knowledge-based systems.  It is
   intended primarily to be a solid example of how such a system could be
   built. FrameWork is easily extended.

   Features include generic demons (active values) & procedural
   attachment, object-oriented programming with attribute and behavior
   inheritance in an associative network (methods and message passing),
   cached values, default values, listener, object database maintenance
   utilities.
