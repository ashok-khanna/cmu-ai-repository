Summary:      Frame-based knowledge representation system.

Version:      1.5 (22-APR-91)

Description: 

   PARMENIDES (PropagAting, Rulekit-Motivated ENgine for Instance
   DEScriptions) is a frame-based knowledge representation system.  It is
   influenced by SRL, Framekit, CommonLoops, and the Spice lisp structure
   implementation.  The slot and facet access functions have comparable
   speed to the Slisp slot access functions.  It has some of the Framekit
   and SRL functionality, such as facets, demons, and user-defined
   relations.  However, like Loops, it makes a distinction between
   classes and instances.  This means that instances can only be an
   instance of one class, while classes may be subclasses of (have an
   is-a relation with) more than one class.  Instances may not have any
   slots that their classes don't have.  Classes describe a way to make
   instances, and instances only participate in the frame network through
   their classes.  Parmenides is implemented in Common Lisp.  Other
   features of Parmenides include multiple language messages and
   user-defined relations.

   Parmenides is used by FRulekit, a CommonLisp frame-based RETE
   production system.
