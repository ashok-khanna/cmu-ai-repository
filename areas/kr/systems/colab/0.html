This directory contains the COmpilation LABoratory (COLAB). 

COLAB is a hybrid knowledge representation system emphasizing the
horizontal and vertical compilation of knowledge bases. It has been
designed as a COmpilation LABoratory aiming at a synergetic
collaboration of different knowledge representation and reasoning
formalisms.  It is comprised of subsystems dealing with different
kinds of knowledge and that can also be used as stand-alone systems.
The COLAB representation architecture splits into two main parts, an
affirmative part, sometimes also called `assertional', and a taxonomic
part.

The affirmative part provides efficient reasoning with different kinds
of relational or functional knowledge using tailored inference
engines.  For affirmative knowledge represented as constraint nets
COLAB supplies constraint propagation techniques (CONTAX). Relational
knowledge in the form of Horn rules is processed by forward (FORWARD)
and backward (RELFUN) chaining.  The backward component is also suited
for expressing (non-deterministic) functional dependencies.  Taxonomic
knowledge is represented by intensional concept definitions which are
automatically arranged in a subsumption hierarchy (TAXON).  Dynamic
cooperation of the subsystems is organized through access primitives
providing an interface to the respective reasoning services.

COLAB is a piece of research software developed at DFKI and the
University of Kaiserslautern.

COLAB involves 4 subsystems:

 +  RELFUN is a logic-programming language with call-by-value
    (eager), non-deterministic, non-ground functions, and
    higher-order operations [Boley92b].

    SHORT DESCRIPTION: Operational (interpreter in pure LISP), procedural
    (SLV-resolution), fixpoint, and model-theoretic semantics [Boley92c].
    Interpreter for full RELFUN; WAM emulator for fixed-arity subset.
    Layered compiler system, from source-to-source transformers to
    declarative classifier, to WAM-code generator [Boley90a].  Translator
    to relational subset of RELFUN, henceforth to PROLOG.  Accepting
    freely interchangeable LISP-style and PROLOG-style syntaxes.  Tracer
    for valued conjunctions; interface to LISP; on-line help.  Prelude
    with useful relations/functions; library of declarative hypergraph
    operations [Boley92a]; components for mechanical-engineering system
    using declarative geometry [BoleyHanschke+91b]. Tight (WAM-level)
    coupling with FORWARD.

 +  TAXON is a terminological knowledge representation system extended by
    concrete domains [BaaderHanschke91b,Hanschke92b].

    SHORT DESCRIPTION: Comprises a T-box and an A-box formalism for
    representing terminological and assertional knowledge.  The T-box
    provides expressive concept forming operators, in particular for
    specifying role/attribute interaction. The TAXON A-box can
    instantiate concepts, roles, etc. All reasoning services (e.g.,
    classification, realization) are implemented by terminating, sound
    and complete algorithms. A concrete domain of rational numbers with
    comparison operators is tightly coupled with the abstract
    terminological formalism.  Can compute the domain hierarchy for
    CONTAX.

 +  CONTAX is a constraint system for weighted constraints over
    hierarchically structured finite domains.

    SHORT DESCRIPTION: The CONTAX system supports primitive
    (extensional), compound (conjunctive), disjunctive and predicative
    constraints.  Constraint instances are connected by variables that
    range over specific domains which can be plain or hierarchically
    structured.  Hierarchical domains can be defined in CONTAX itself or
    by using the classifier of TAXON. Intervals regarded as subdomains of
    integers are also supported. All constraints are given a weight (from
    a discrete set ranging from 'hard' to 'soft') that is used by CONTAX
    for relaxation of overspecified problems.  Besides being integrated
    in COLAB, there also exists a stand-alone version of CONTAX with a
    programmer interface to LISP [MeyerSteinle92] that enables any
    LISP-based application to use CONTAX as its own constraint-reasoning
    formalism. The CONTAX system has already been used to formalize the
    tool selection problem in a CIM application [Meyer92a,Meyer92b].

 +  FORWARD is a logic programming language with bottom-up and top-down
    evaluation of Horn clauses [HarmHinkelmann+92].

    SHORT DESCRIPTION: User-specifiable division of Horn clauses for
    bottom-up, top-down and bidirectional reasoning.  Semi-naive
    bottom-up evaluation with top-down provable premises.  Generalized
    Magic-Set transformation for goal-directed bottom-up reasoning,
    supporting conjunctive queries and considering top-down premises. An
    interpreter version is available, there is also an abstract machine,
    which will be available in the near future.  Simulation of forward
    chaining in a backward chaining system by rule transformation.
    Compilation into a WAM with special forward code area and additional
    so-called retain stack for derived facts.  Upside-down
    meta-interpreter in RELFUN for forward chaining, partial evaluation
    of the meta-interpreter.  Tight coupling with the RELFUN system on
    interpreter-level and WAM-level. A tight integration of the
    semi-naive strategy with the TAXON system is currently under
    development.

Other subsystems used in COLAB include 
  -  GAMA (General Abstract Machine Assembler)
  -  NyWAM (WAM emulator in Common Lisp)
