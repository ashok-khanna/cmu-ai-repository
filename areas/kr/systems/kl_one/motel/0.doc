Summary:      Modal KL-ONE

Version:      10-AUG-93

Description: 
              
   MOTEL is a logic-based knowledge representation language of the KL-ONE
   family.  It contains as a kernel the ALC language which is a decidable
   sublanguage of first-order predicate logic.

   Whereas ALC is a single-agent knowledge representation language, i.e.
   ALC is only able to represent general world knowledge or the knowledge
   of one agent about the world, MOTEL is a multi-agent knowledge
   representation system. The MOTEL language allows modal contexts and
   modal concept forming operators which allow to represent and reason
   about the believes and wishes of multiple agents. Furthermore it is
   possible to represent defaults and stereotypes.

   Beside the basic reasoning facilities for consistency checking,
   classification, and realization, MOTEL provides an abductive inference
   mechanism.  Furthermore it is able to give explanations for its
   inferences.
