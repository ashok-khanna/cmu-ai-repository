A BRIEF DESCRIPTION  OF MOTEL 
-----------------------------

MOTEL  is a  logic-based  knowledge  representation  languages of  the
KL-ONE family.   It contains as a kernel  the ALC  language which is a
decidable sublanguage of first-order predicate logic.

Whereas ALC is a  single-agent knowledge representation language, i.e.
ALC is only able to represent general world knowledge or the knowledge
of one  agent  about the  world,  MOTEL  is a   multi-agent  knowledge
representation  system. The MOTEL  language  allows modal contexts and
modal concept forming  operators which allow  to represent  and reason
about the  believes and wishes of  multiple  agents. Furthermore it is
possible to represent defaults and stereotypes.

Beside   the  basic   resoning facilities   for  consistency checking,
classification, and realization, MOTEL provides an abductive inference
mechanism.   Furthermore it  is able  to   give  explanations for  its
inferences.

Keywords:        Knowledge representation, Modal Logic, Stereotypes, 
                 Default Reasoning, Abduction.
