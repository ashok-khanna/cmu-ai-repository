Summary:      Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System

Version:      3.0 (4-OCT-94)

Description: 

   PEBLS (Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System) is a nearest-neighbor
   learning system designed for applications where the instances have
   symbolic feature values.  PEBLS has been applied to the prediction of
   protein secondary structure and to the identification of DNA promoter
   sequences. 

   PEBLS incorporates a number of features intended to support
   flexible experimentation in symbolic domains.  We have provided
   support for k-nearest neighbor learning, and the ability to choose
   among different techniques for weighting both exemplars and individual
   features.  A number of post-processing techniques specific to the
   domain of protein secondary structure have also been provided.
