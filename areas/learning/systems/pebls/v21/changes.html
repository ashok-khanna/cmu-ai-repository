PEBLS 2.1 corrects a number of bugs reported in the original 
PEBLS  2.0.   PEBLS 2.1 also provides support for continuous
data whereby the system discretizes feature values into
a number of even intervals specified by the user.

If you have any problems running PEBLS 2.1, please let
us know.


				Thank You.

1.	Corrected Feature value indices so that they are 1..N consistent
	with the documentation.  (Previously assumed 0..N-1)

2.	Corrected a bug which caused user-specified feature weights to
	be ignored.  (Assigns USER_DEFINED to CONFIG.feature_weighting
	whenever a feature specific weighting assignment is encountered
 	in the configuration file -- rather than leaving it as OFF.)

1.	CONFIG.instances, CONFIG.test_instances, CONFIG.training_instances
	initialized to "0" rather than "UNKNOWN" (-1) to prevent crashes
	when entering the procedure "subunit_to_instances" for the 
	first time.





2.	In the procedure "subunit_to_instances" the line:
		if (instances > INSTANCES_MAX) error(INSTANCES_ERR, NULL);
	changed to:
		if (instances > INSTANCES_MAX -1) error(INSTANCES_ERR, NULL);




3.	Corrected bounds error in "initialize_output"
	The line: 
	    for (t=0; t<TRIALS_MAX+1; t++)
	changed to:
	    for (t=0; t<TRIALS_MAX; t++)

	Support for continuous valued features.
