Summary:      Knowledge Acquisition and Machine Learning System

Version:      3.0b

Description: 

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  
   MOBAL includes a graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   Since the very first releases, MOBAL has been a kind of toolbox
   offering different tools (including the Rule Discovery Tool RDT) to
   support the modeling of domains.  Now we have coupled MOBAL with some
   other well known ILP systems. The new release contains interfaces to
   and the code of following learning systems:

      - FOIL 5 (J. Ross Quinlan),
      - GOLEM  (S. Muggleton and C. Feng),
      - mFOIL  (S. Dzeroski and I. Bratko),
      - CILGG  (J.-U. Kietz), and
      - INCY   (E. Sommer).
