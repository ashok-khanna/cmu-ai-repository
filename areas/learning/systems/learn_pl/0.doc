Summary:      Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog

Version:      9-FEB-94

Description:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 
   
   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe (see address
   below).  Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated 3.5 inch floppy
   (double, high and extra-high density), which should be included with
   your request. You can also get them by sending an email message to
   Thomas Hoppe.
   
   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems
   to Thomas Hoppe. Send suggestions and complaints about the ftp
   library to Werner Emde.  
   
   The directory ftp.gmd.de:/MachineLearning/ contains additional
   machine learning publications, data, and software, primarily related
   to the European ESPRIT projects Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT) and
   Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the European Network of Excellence
   in Machine Learning (MLnet) and the Inductive Logic Programming
   Pan-European Scientific Network (ILPnet). It includes the source code
   of Stephen Muggleton's and Cao Feng's GOLEM learning system (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/software/golem) and a BibTeX file with
   around 325 entries of articles related to ILP (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/bib). For more information, send mail to
   Marcus Luebbe <ml-archive@gmd.de>.

Requires:     Prolog

Ports:        All of the algorithms are written in Edinburgh Prolog syntax.
