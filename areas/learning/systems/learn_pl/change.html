                - Bug in data set cobweb_3.pl removed 
                - Output of cobweb.pl prettyfied
	        - Prolog dialect dependency removed
	        - Modified for avoiding rounding errors
	        - Parameter 'acuity' can now be modified explicitly
              IDT             
                - Zero-division bug removed 
	        - Several Prolog dependencies removed
	        - Additional examples prepared
              AQ1
                - Prolog dialect dependency removed
              All algorithms give now at consultation time a brief 
              description of how to call them, which can also be obtained 
              by proofing the goal 'help'.
   5 Mar  93: INVERS.PRO: The program has be changed for compatibility
              with C-PROLOG
   5 Mar  92: COBWEB: A bug in the computation of the prediction score
              of nodes has been removed. Furthermore, some changes were
	      made in order to improve the readability (e.g., comments
	      were added) and the compatibility with other PROLOG dialects.
	      Furthermore, several small example data sets have been added.
  25 Sept 91: Basic algorithms for explanation based generalisation 
              and partial evaluation based on Kedar-Cabelli
              & McCarty's idea. Different kinds of simple PROLOG
              meta-interpreters added (directory: ebg)
  25 Sept 91: Ivan Bratko's algorithm for learning attributional
              descriptions added (directory: attdsc)
  25 Sept 91: The directories are no longer archived and compressed.
