Summary:      Raymond Mooney's Machine Learning Collection

Description:

   This directory contains a copy of the machine learning programs and
   publications made available by the machine learning group under
   Raymond Mooney at UT-Austin.
   
   There are four subdirectories:
   
      course/   information and homeworks from a graduate course
                in machine learning taught by Dr. Mooney. Homeworks
                include "miniatures" of various machine learning
                systems written in Common Lisp.
   
      code/     Common Lisp code corresponding to the assignments
                for the course in the course directory.
   
      progs/    More "research-level" versions of inductive
                classification algorithms and software for automated
                experiments that generation learning curves that
                compare several systems. 
   
      papers/   Publications produced by the machine learning
                research group.
