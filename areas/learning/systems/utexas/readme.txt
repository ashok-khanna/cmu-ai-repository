This directory contains various programs and text files relating to Machine
Learning.  The subdirectories contain the following:

(1) The subdirectory "ml-course" contains information and homeworks for
a graduate course in Machine Learning taught by myself at the University of
Texas at Austin.  These homeworks use various "miniatures" of various machine
learning systems written in Common Lisp.

(2) The subdirectory "ml-code" has the Common Lisp code corresponding to the
assignments for the course outlined in "ml-course". Most of the programs are
inductive learning systems that use the same data format.  Some data files are
also included in the directory.  This software is continually evolving and all
of the systems are no longer necessarily compatible with each other and/or the
assignments in "ml-course." 

(3) The subdirectory "ml-progs" contains more "research-level" versions of
inductive classification algorithms and software for automated experiments that
generate learning curves that compare several systems.  The only documentation
currently provided is the (sometimes sparse) comments that appear in the files.

(4) The sub directory "papers" contains publications produced by our research
group. This includes papers presented at past conferences as well as current
work submitted for publication.
