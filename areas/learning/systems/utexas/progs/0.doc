Summary:      More "Research-Level" Implementations of Learning Algorithms

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a copy of more "research-level" versions of
   the inductive classification algorithms and software for automated
   experiments that generate learning curves that compare several systems.

   Programs include:
     1. AQ
     2. Bayes independent classification system.
     3. COBWEB
     4. DEDUCE
     5. Extentron
     6. FOIL (First Order Inductive Learning) in Lisp and Prolog
     7. ID3
     8. K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm 
     9. Perceptron
    10. Backprop
    11. A dual propositional version of FOIL for learning CNF.
    12. A propositional version of FOIL for learning DNF.
    13. Functions for running statistical t-test on results of experiments.
