Summary:      NEITHER Theory Refinement System

Version:      

Description: 

   NEITHER, which stands for "New EITHER", is an extension of the EITHER
   theory refinement system. Theory refinement systems are used to modify
   a set of rules which are incomplete or incorrect. Given a set of
   examples, the rules are refined until the rule base is consistent with
   the examples. One example of the use of theory refinement is the
   knowledge acquisition phase of expert system construction.
   Specifically, it may be relatively simple to develop a set of rules to
   cover most of a problem but difficult to generate a complete solution.
   Often, additional examples can be generated easily and given with the
   partially correct theory to a system like NEITHER. The result is an
   improved set of rules.
