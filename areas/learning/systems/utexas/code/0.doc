Summary:      Lisp Code for Assignments in Mooney's Machine Learning Course

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a copy of the Common Lisp code
   corresponding to the assignments for the graduate course in machine
   learning taught by Dr. Mooney.

   The programs include:

     1. AQ algorithms for learning from examples. Uses either beam
        search with bounded stars or the version space algorithm to
        compute stars.

    2. BACKPROP.

    3. COBWEB.  Incremental conceptual clustering algorithm (with
       soybean data). 

    4. DEDUCE. Prolog-like theorem prover or deductive retrieval
       system. Uses generators to retrieve one answer at a time and
       also generates proofs. Supports only backward chaining, with
       optional depth bound on the number of rules.

    5. EGGS. Explanation-Based Generalizer. EGGS can generalize the
       proofs returned by DEDUCE and generate macro-rules from the
       general proofs. These macro-rules are stored and preferentially
       used in future deductions to increase performance.

   6. EXPLORER. In the spirit of AM, but more limited. Explores a
      space of concepts, guided by "interestingness" measures and
      makes conjectures about the concepts it explores. 

   7. ID3 algorithm for learning from examples. Produces decision trees
      discriminating positive and negative instances.

   8. PERCEPTRON.  Simple system for learning from examples
      using the perceptron learning procedure to adjust a set of
      weights on a single linear threshold unit until all of the
      training examples are correctly classified. 

   9. VERSION-SPACE algorithm for incremental learning from examples.
