For ID3 you can refer to:

Quinlan, J.R., 'Discovering Rules by Induction from Large Collections of
Examples', in Expert Systems in the Micro-electronic Age (ed. Michie, D.),
Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 1979.

Quinlan, J.R., 'Semi-Autonomous Acquisition of Pattern-Based Knowledge', in
Introductory Readings in Expert Systems (Ed. Michie, D.), New York, Gordon
and Breach Science Publishers, 1982.

The AQ11 algorithm is described and used in the following interesting
article:

Michalski, R.S.; Chilausky, R.L., 'Knowledge acquisition by encoding expert
rules versus computer induction from examples', Int. J. Man-Machine Studies
(1980) 12, pp.63-87.

I've some other articles in the field of biomedical engineering refering to
ID3 (for detecting gait events in Functional Electrical Stimulation systems).
