Summary:      Crossword

Version:      1.0

Description: 

   Crossword allows you to create blank crossword puzzle frames and then
   have the computer fill them with words from a chosen dictionary.  You
   can watch the computer while it works, even interrupting it and
   stepping one letter at a time to better understand what it's doing.

   The program is intended to provide a testing ground for different
   search algorithms.  It acts as a visual tool to identify the strengths
   and weaknesses of a particular method.  With a little work and proper
   understanding of the code, one can add new search algorithms to the
   program.
