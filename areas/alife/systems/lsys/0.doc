Name:         Lsys

Summary:      Grow lifelike plants using simple rules.

Version:      (21-MAR-91)

Description: 

   Lsys is a program to generate complex models using string production
   systems called L-Systems, as described in Prusinkiewicz and
   Lindenmayer's book. These L-Systems can be used to "grow"
   natural-looking plants out of very simple rules. Lsys produces output
   in PostScript and in a generic text format. Adding new output formats
   is straightforward.  Some of the L-systems described in Lindenmayer's
   book have been included.

Requires:     C++ or G++

Ports:        DECstation 3100 and Sun4. Porting to other Unix systems
              should be easy.
