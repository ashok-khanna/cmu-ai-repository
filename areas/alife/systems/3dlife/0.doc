Description: 

   This system allows visual examination of 3-dimensional cellular
   automata. The automata are displayed using cubes or wireframe
   graphics. The system allows a variety of rules.  The simulated
   universe measures 128x128x64 and wraps around at the edges.

Requires:     IBM PC 386/486 with extended VGA card, 4Mb+ RAM. Runs in
