Summary:      Evolution of digital organisms

Version:      4.0 (16-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.

   This system results in the production of synthetic organisms based on
   a computer metaphor of organic life in which CPU time is the
   ``energy'' resource and memory is the ``material'' resource.  Memory
   is organized into informational patterns that exploit CPU time for
   self-replication.  Mutation generates new forms, and evolution
   proceeds by natural selection as different genotypes compete for CPU
   time and memory space. Diverse ecological communities have emerged.
