Summary:      Model of agent interactions

Version:      1.0 (23-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Echo is a model of complex adaptive systems proposed by John Holland,
   in which virtually all of the physical details of real systems have
   been abstracted away. Instead, it concentrates on a small set of
   primitive agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. The goal of
   Echo is to study how simple interactions among simple agents lead to
   emergent high-level complex phenomena such as the flow of resources in
   a system or cooperation and competition in networks of agents (e.g.,
   communities, trading networks, or arms races).
