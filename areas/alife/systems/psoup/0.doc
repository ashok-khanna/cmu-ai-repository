Description: 

   Primordial Soup is an artificial life program similar in concept to
   Thomas Ray's Tierra system. Organisms are computer software loops that
   live in a shared memory space and self-reproduce. The organisms mutate
   and evolve, behaving in accordance with the principles of Darwinian
   evolution.  Since the memory space is shared, multiple organisms can
   execute the same program or program fragments, and can overwrite each
   other in part or in whole.
