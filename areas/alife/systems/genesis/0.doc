Summary:      GEneral NEural SImulation System

Version:      GENESIS 1.4.1 (August 1993); RALLPACKS 1.1 (July 1992)

Description: 

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  XODUS is a graphical front end for
   GENESIS. 

   The distribution includes full source code and documentation for both
   GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen demonstration and tutorial
   simulations.  Documentation for these simulations is included, along
   with three papers that describe the general organization of the
   simulator.

   Also included is a set of "Rallpacks" benchmarks for speed
   and accuracy of the simulation. The three sets of benchmarks model a
   linear passive cable with many compartments, a highly branched cable, and
   a linear axon containing Hodgkin-Huxley channels.  The simulator results
   may be compared to the exact analytic solutions (for the first two cases)
   and to the results given by GENESIS and by NEURON, another popular neural
   simulator.  (The results for these two simulators show nearly identical
   speed and accuracy.)

   The GENESIS Users Group, BABEL, provides some informal support to
   GENESIS users. BABEL members have access to an email list, a repository
   of contributions by GENESIS users and developers, new simulations,
   libraries of cells and channels, additional simulator components, new
   documentation and tutorials, and bug reports and fixes. Membership
   requires a one-time $200 registration fee made payable to the California
   Institute of Technology and sent to Jim Bower, Computational Neural
   Systems Program, 216-76, Caltech, Pasadena, CA, 91125.  Please provide
   name, institution, mailing address, phone number, an email address for
   the mailing list, and an account name for use on the BABEL computer.

Requires:     C
              X-windows (versions X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5)
              UNIX (Sun version 4.0 and up, DEC Ultrix 3.1, 4.0 and up)

Ports:        The current version of GENESIS has also been used with
              Silicon Graphics (Irix 4.0.1 and up) and the HP 700
              series (HPUX).
