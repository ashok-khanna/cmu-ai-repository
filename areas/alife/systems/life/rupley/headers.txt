[From the author...]
[[There appears to be no "life", the Conway population simulation, in
comp.sources.{games|misc|unix}.  An X version was posted recently to
comp.sources.x.  If only for historical interest, perhaps there should
be one that works on standard terminals.  This version is adapted from
code written by Leor Zolman, the creator of BDS C. It compiles and runs
under SysV or BSD, using curses or termcap.
