SUBJECT: Revised Alife Syllabus

The Alife Workshop is now up and running at Iowa  State  University.
Word-of-mouth  attendance  was so good at the first "Introduction to
Alife" meeting---twelve faculty  and  five  students  from  computer
science,  electrical  engineering,  economics,  math,  math biology,
philosophy, physics, psychology, and statistics---that we  have  now
moved  to  a  larger  room  and  are  adverstising the workshop more
broadly.

Below is a LaTeX-formatted and annotated Alife Syllabus, extensively
revised from the last  version  I  submitted  to  the  alsyll  list.
Twenty-two readings have been selected for moderated  discussion  at
future   Alife  Workshop  meetings.   Comments  or  suggestions  for
additional readings would be most appreciated.

   \footnote{This syllabus is based in part on alife syllabi
prepared by Emanuel Gruengard of Bar-Ilan University, John Koza of
Stanford University, and Martin Zwick of Portland State University,
and on the FAQ in comp.ai.genetic prepared by Joerg Heitkoetter of
the University of Dortmund.}

     Artificial life (Alife) is the ``bottom up'' study of basic
phenomena commonly associated with living agents, such as
self-replication, metabolism, morphogenesis, evolution, adaptation,
self-organization, competition, parasitism, and mutual cooperation.
Alife complements the traditional biological and social sciences
concerned with the analytical and experimental study of living
organisms by attempting to synthesize life-like behavior within
computers and other artificial media.  In addition to permitting new
forms of controlled experimentation and testing of life processes,
the alife approach has yielded robust ``natural'' computer
algorithms for determining approximate solutions for difficult
optimization problems characterized by high-dimensional search
domains, nonlinearities, and/or multiple local optima.

Three new journals that focus on these topics are: {\it Adaptive
Behavior\/}, {\it Artificial Life\/}, and {\it Evolutionary
Computation\/}.  Other journals of interest include: {\it Artificial
Intelligence\/}, {\it BioSystems\/}, {\it Complex Systems\/}, {\it
IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks\/}, {\it IEEE Transactions on
Systems, Man, and Cybernetics\/}, {\it IEEE Transactions on Robotics
and Automation\/}, the {\it Journal of Evolutionary Economics\/},
the {\it Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization\/}, {\it
Machine Learning\/}, {\it Neural Computation\/}, {\it Neural
Networks\/}, {\it Robotica\/}, and {\it Theoretical Population
Biology\/}.

     Suggested readings on both alife and natural computation are given
below. \vspace*{4mm}
