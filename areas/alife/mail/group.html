Artificial Life Electronic Discussion List:
-------------------------------------------

There is an electronic discussion-list on Artificial Life via email. 
To *join* this online discussion, or to communicate directly
with the list maintainers, send email to:

                   alife-request@cognet.ucla.edu
                   
                  
Contributions to the discussion itself (but *not* requests to
join the list or to be removed from it, etc.) should be sent to:
  
  		      alife@cognet.ucla.edu
  		      
The list maintainers are Liane Gabora and Rob Collins of the UCLA
Computer Science Dept. 

Note that the previous addresses for "alife" and "alife-request" at 
"iuvax.cs.indiana.edu" are no longer valid, so people should convert to 
the "cognet.ucla.edu" versions. Due to an aliasing bug, submissions sent 
to Indiana were being bounced. So, if you've submitted anything to the 
list recently,you might want to resubmit it to "alife@cognet.ucla.edu."
