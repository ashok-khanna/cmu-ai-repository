Summary:      Robot Arm Simulator

Version:      22-JUL-92

Description: 

   RSIM is a SGI-based graphical robot simulator from the University
   of Melbourne, with very nice graphics. It does discrete time
   simulation of an arbitrary linked robot arm, with full kinematics and
   dynamics. There is a discrete-time controller and a standard C interface
   so that users can create and test different controller algorithms.

   The robot simulator currently only works on SGI machines, and in a
   no-graphics mode on other machines. When the IPRS GUI standard is
   established, the authors will be converting this to run under IPRS,
   which will make it machine independent.
   
Requires:     C

Ports:        SGI machines; will run without graphics on other machines.
