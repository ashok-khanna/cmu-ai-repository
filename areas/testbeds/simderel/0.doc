Summary:      Robot Simulator

Version:      2.0.1 (17-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
   (the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
   X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
   multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot. It is a fast
   general-purpose display method which places separate objects in space
   depending on the homogeneous matrices it receives from SIMMEL. CONNEL
   is the controller, which must be designed by the user. In the
   distributed version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.
   No neural networks are included.  The programs use Unix sockets for
   communication, so you must have sockets, but you can run the programs
   on different machines.  Since data communication is high-level (all
   data is encoded before transmission), cross architecture portability
   is high.  In fact, CONNEL can simultaneously control a real robot and
   the simulated one.  When nothing is happening, Simderella will sleep
   and not use any processor time.

Requires:     C

Ports:        The software has been compiled using gcc on SunOS
              running under X11R4/5 on Sun3, Sun4, Sun Sparc 1, 2, and
              10, DEC Alpha, HP700, 386/486 (Linux), and Silicon
              Graphics architectures.
