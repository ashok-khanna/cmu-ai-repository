The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
interface to the X window system. The simulator is written in Nisp,
a macro-package for Common Lisp. 

RPL is the reactive plan language interpreter.
