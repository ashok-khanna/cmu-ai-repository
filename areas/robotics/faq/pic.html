Notes:

1.  Program memory is EPROM unless otherwise noted.
2.  Data memory is number of usable bytes, not including special function
    registers.
3.  Digikey prices are quantity 10 prices for 4 MHz DIP packaged OTP parts
    with RC oscillator option (where applicable), except that the 16C84 uses
    EEPROM program memory, and the slowest speed 17C42 is rated at 16 MHz.
    Prices are from Digikey catalog number 943 for May/June 1994.
    Other distributors often have lower prices, but typically also have
    high minimum order requirements.  Digikey also usually has plenty of
    parts in stock.  Windowed EPROM parts cost substantially more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




2.3)
Notes for programmers:

All PIC instructions are a single word.  The equivalent of the immediate
address mode of other processors is the literal mode, used by instructions
ending in "LW", such as MOVLW, ADDLW, SUBLW, ANDLW, IORLW, XORLW, and RETLW.
The byte of data used by these instructions is directly encoded in the
instruction itself.

All PIC instructions take a single instruction cycle (four oscillator cycles)
to execute, unless a conditional test is TRUE or the program counter is changed
as a result of an instruction, in this case the execution takes two instruction
cycles.  For example:

	movlw	37
	goto	next
next:	movwf	porta

The goto instruction takes two cycles (1 to get the value of label "next" and 1
to load that value into the program counter) This is useful as a two-cycle NOP,
and is often written as "goto .+1" to avoid the need for a label.

The W register is equivalent to the accumulator on other processors.  Almost
all data movement, arithmetic, and logic operations use W.

Instructions that operate on W and a register (i.e., instructions ending in
"WF", like ADDWF and MOVWF) allow the result to be placed in either W or the
register (but not both).  This is specified by a ",W" or ",F" after the
operand.  The default is ",F", which will place the result in the register.
This can cause a lot of confusion if you're not careful, so I recommend
always specifying the destination explicitly.  An example of a confusing
instruction:

	incf	foo,w	; w := foo+1  note that foo is unchanged!

If you want the result in both W and the register, you can use either:

	incf	foo,w
	mowwf	foo

or:

	incf	foo,f
	movf	foo,w

The stack is not accessible to the programmer in any way other than the
call and return instructions.  There is no way to push or pull data, or even
to examine the stack pointer.  On the 16C5x family the stack has only two
levels, so it is frequently necessary to write code in a different style than
would be used on a typical processor; you can only call subroutines from your
main code, or from a subroutine called from main, but no deeper. If you try
to make a 3rd CALL, the 2nd return address is over-written so that the return
from the 3rd CALL is OK but the return from the 2nd CALL ends up where the
1st CALL should return to.

The 16CXX parts which implement an 8 level stack do so in a circular fashion,
so that the 9th CALL over-writes the return address for the 1st CALL.

The 16C5x family doesn't have a normal return instruction; instead it has
RETLW, which stands for RETurn Literal Word.  RETLW loads an eight bit
constant into W (just as a MOVLW instruction would), then returns from the
subroutine.  This can be useful, but is agravating if you want to return a
computed value.  On the newer PIC families there is a normal RETURN
instruction.

With the exception of the 17Cxx family, there is no way for software to read
an arbitrary location of program memory.  In order to implement lookup tables,
it is necessary to combine the use of the ADDWF and RETLW instructions.  For
example, the following code implements a lookup table of the first four odd
prime numbers:

primes:	addwf	pcl
	retlw	3
	retlw	5
	retlw	7
	retlw	11

To use the table, load the appropriate index (in this case, 0 to 3) into W,
and "call primes".  The addwf instruction adds the contents of W to the PC,
which has already been incremented to point to the "retlw 3".  The table will
return with the value in W.  The total time taken is 6 instruction cycles, or
24 oscillator cycles.

Note that while on most processors the use of an out-of-range index will
result in the use of incorrect data, but the program execution will continue
normally, on the PIC a bad index value will cause the execution of arbitrary
instructions!

 i.e. the computed address must be in the top 1/2 of page.

Normally the index would range from 0 to the size of the table minus one,
but it is possible to use other ranges by putting the retlw instructions
somewhere other than immediately following the "addwf pcl".  It is also
possible to implement tables using a "subwf pcl", or perhaps other 
instructions with pcl as the destination.

The subtract instructions (SUBWF and SUBLW) work differently than most people
expect.  SUBWF subracts W *from* the contents of the register, and SUBLW
subtracts W *from* the literal.  (SUBLW is not available on the 16C5x family.)

If you want to subtract a literal from W, it is easiest to use the ADDLW
instruction with the two's complement of the literal.  For example:

	addlw	0feh	; w := w - 2

Some assemblers allow this to be written as:

	addlw	-2

There is no instruction to take the two's complement of W (like the NEG
instruction on Motorola processors), but because of the way the subract
instructions work you can use:

	sublw	0

On the 16C5x family, the CALL instruction can only address the first 256 words
of a bank of program memory.  It is common practice to use "call extenders",
which are simply GOTO instructions in the first 256 words with a target in
the last 256 words.

On the 16C57 and 16C58, if you plan to use indirect addressing (via the FSR
and IND registers), it is vitally important that your reset code clear FSR
before using any other RAM locations.  Otherwise you may start up in an
arbitrary bank, and as soon as you change FSR all your carefully set up
variables will effectively disappear.
