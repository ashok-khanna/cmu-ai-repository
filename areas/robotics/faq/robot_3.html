[6] What University Programs are there?

	Any good four-year school undoubtedly offers robotics courses
within engineering programs. Departments of mechanical and electrical
engineering and computer science are all good candidates for
coursework in Robotics. However, a number of schools have established
track records with a focus on robotics and those are listed here.

Peterson's publishes a series of guides to higher education programs.
Their Graduate Programs in Engineering & Applied Sciences, 1994, lists
graduate programs in robotics in the U.S.  The following are those
listed which offer PhD programs in robotics:

Carnegie Mellon University
	PhD in Robotics
	The Robotics Institute

Catholic University of America
        PhD in Design and Robotics
        Department of Mechanical Engineering

Cornell University
        PhD in Robotics
        PhD in Artificial Intelligence
        Field of Computer Science

Ohio University
        PhD in Intelligent Systems
        Department of Integrated Engineering

University of California, San Diego
        PhD in intelligent systems, robotics, and control
        Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Note that this list is both too short and somewhat inaccurate because
many universities offers robotics research within the scope of other
engineering and science programs.

	The McGill Centre for Intelligent Machines, CIM, was founded
in 1985 to provide researchers in robotics, computer vision, speech
recognition, and systems and control with a context in which to pursue
their common goal: the understanding and creation of systems which
exhibit intelligent behaviour.  The three main research foci are
perception, robotics and control theory.  The Centre now includes
faculty members and graduate students from five departments:
Electrical, Mechanical, Biomedical, and Mining and Metallurgical
Engineering, and the School of Computer Science.
	The center itself does not have a degree program, rather
students enroll in one of the associated departments and gain access
by being supervised a faculty member who is also a CIM member.  There
are research programs directly related to computer vision, robot
mechanical systems, walking machines, mobile robotics, etc.

University of Oxford
Robotics Research Group
  The Robotics Group currently comprises about seventy academics,
  postdoctoral research staff, overseas visitors, and graduate
  students.  A broad range of topics in advanced robotics is studied
  in collaboration with industry and government establishments
  throughout Europe.
	Robot Design and Control
  A number of projects are concerned with the design and control of
  compliant robot arms.
	Parallel Architectures
  Real-time sensor-based control of systems such as robot vehicles is
  a topic of increasing interest.  For low bandwidth sensors such
  sonar, the emphasis is on Transputer architectures.  For high
  bandwidth sensors such as vision, hybrid SIMD/MIMD architectures are
  being developed.  A rapidly growing effort is concerned with the
  design, implementation, and application of neural networks.  Digital
  and hybrid digital/analog chips have been designed and are being
  fabricated.  Algorithms and TTL circuits have been constructed for
  text-to-speech synthesis.
	Vision and Active Vision
  The theory and applications of vision accounts for approximately
  one-third of the laboratory's effort.  Current projects include edge
  detection and texture segmentation and the computation of visual
  motion by a parallel algorithm that estimates the optic flow field.
	Sensors and Sensor Integration 
  Includes laser rangefinder development in addition to analog and
  digital sonar sensors, as well as infrared rangers, have been
  developed for the AGV project (below).
	Autonomous Guided Vehicles 
  Work on a research prototype of a fielded industrial AGV cuts across
  many of the separate themes of the laboratory's work.  The goal of
  the initial project is to equip the AGV with sonar, infrared, laser
  ranging, trinocular stereo, and model-based vision sensors to enable
  it to avoid unexpected obstacles and to locate pallets.

[7] What is the State of the Robot Industry?

In general, there was a significant slump in the mid to late 1980's in
industrial robotics. However in the early 1990's sales and number have
rebounded to surpass early 1980 numbers and dollars.

>From Motion Control Magazine April 1994: Robotics Industries
Association said recently Robot orders jumped 40% through June, 1993
as the industry posted its best opening half-year ever....  Net new
orders received by U.S. based robotics companies totalled 3,640 robots
valued at $306.2 million, the highest unit and dollar figures ever.

>From the New York Times, Wednesday September 7th pC1
(paraphrased) In the late 1980's a steep decline in robot orders drove
most US companies out of the business. In the first half of 1994 4,335
robots with a total value of $383.5 million. Fanuc is the leader with
about $360M in sales this year. Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) is second with
sales estimated at $120M. The next several are Japanese: Motoman,
Panasonic, Sony and Nachi.

The only major US producer to have survived is Adept Technology with
about $50M in sales in a $700M market.

Interpreted from a graph in the article:
Net new orders in US:
	Year	# of robots	$US
	1984	5800		$480M
	1985	6200		$380M
	1986	5400		$320M
	1987	3800		$300M
	1988	4000		$325M
	1989	4500		$510M
	1990	5000		$510M
	1991	4000		$410M
	1992	5250		$500M
	1993	6800		$630M
	1994	4335 (6 mos)	$383M (6 mos)

>From Industry Flash Vol1, No. 4, Dec 5, 1994:
	DEMAND FOR U.S. INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS SURGING
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - U.S.-based robotics companies are
enjoying the best of times.  The Robotics Industries
Association (RIA) says surging demand recently led American
robotic companies to their best nine-month totals ever.
Through September, new orders totaled 6,218 robots valued at
$548 million, a 12 percent increase in units and 13 percent
increase in revenue over the previous nine-month period last
year.  The greatest demand, says the trade group, is coming
from U.S. manufacturers which are finally learning what the
Japanese have known for years: robots can play a significant
role in improving productivity, quality, flexibility and
time-to-market.  But, even though demand is surging and the
U.S. is the world's second largest robotics user with some
53,000 systems, the Japanese have more than seven times as
many robots in use, RIA says.

  Company formed as a spin off of the Institute of Robotics, ETH
  (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology). "mecos Robotics"
  specialises in modular and adaptive robot manipulators and
  robot vehicles (mobile robots). All "mecos Robotics" systems
  uses the same type of controller, a VME based computer. This
  system comes with high level development tools, and for
  research institutions the systems have the advantage of being
  open. The overall goals of all "mecos Robotics" systems are
  flexility and modularity.

  The mobile robot program from "mecos Robotics" follows this
  principle. The physical size and the mechanical configuration
  can be altered. The standard configuration has three wheels
  with air tyres and independant suspension. One wheel is used
  for steering and propulsion (imagine a kids tricycle).  The
  overall size is 0.7 m (W) * 1.0 m (L) * 0.5 m (H). The price
  depends on configuration and starts around the 70.000,- Swiss

The Robotic Solar Mower is a 12.5 lb. automated solar-powered "lawn 
groomer." It uses a wire boundary system to keep it inside the 
mowing area. It runs continuously when the sun shines. Its operation 
is "virtually noise free." It continues on its constant mowing course, 
taking between several hours and several days to complete a 
grooming cycle (depending on size of yard, obstacles, etc.). Instead of 
cutting 1/3 of the grass blades (as in a conventional mower), it only 
trims the tips. It can handle a yard up to 13,500 sq. feet and has a 
slope tolerance of 15-20 degress. A pilot program is currently 
offering the mower in the US for $2,000.

  manipulators and robot vehicles (mobile robots). All mecos
  Robotics systems use a VME based computer as controller.  The
  system comes with high level development tools, and are open
  systems. The manipulator's mechanical configuration can be
  changed at will (number and type of joints, length of links,
  etc.)  Manipulators use linear aluminum extrusions with
  integral motions for joints. The controller accounts for
  configuration changes. With this principle of modularity and
  flexibilty hybrid force / position controllers have been
  realised on "mecos Robotics" arms. Price depending on
  configuration (50.000,- Swiss Franks and upwards). NTSC or PAL

  Robotics group:
  	Intelligent Systems Division covers robotics and related areas.
  It consists of following sections; Intelligent Machine Behavior,
  Autonomous Systems, Computer Vision, Interactive Interface Systems, and
  Communicating Intelligence.
  The robotics group in the division foucuses on intelligent robots
  and system integration. Its current research topics include, but not

  The robotics group at ETL has continuously been at the frontier of
  intelligent robotics research.
  
  PostDoc positions:
  	ETL accepts postdoctoral research fellows from all over the
  world. Mainly two support programs are available: STA fellowship and
  AIST fellowship. They require a doctoral degree, age no greater
  than 35, fluency in Japanese or English, etc. Typical research
  period is one year (2 yrs max.). The fellowship includes a basic
  allowance (270,000yen/month) plus family allowance (50,000yen/month),
  housing cost, and a round trip air ticket (1 person).
  The fellowships are highly competetive and have different application
  procedures depending on an applicant's nationality.
  Those who are interested should contact their local governmental
  agency for international research cooperation (such as NSF in USA).
  A more convenient way might be to catch a member of ETL staff at some
  conference and inquire about the fellowships.

  Graduate Summer Institute Program:
	ETL is a member of the graduate summer institute program. The
  robotics group hosts a couple of guest student researchers every summer.
  The Graduate Summer Institute program is based on Japan-USA contract on
  research cooperation in science and technology.
  It is open for graduate students in the USA who are majoring in
  science and technology fields.
  The aim of the program is to provide opportunities for the students to
  get acquainted with Japanese culture, science and techonology, and to
  promote future collaboration in research in science and techonology.
  Here is some data from last year's example.
  Period: 2 months (Late June -- Late August).
  Program (subj. to change): Japanese classes. Research at host
  institutes. Lectures, Meetings, Going to Kabuki, Kyoto tour,
  Official Receptions. 
  Support: Return air ticket, domestic transportation, accomodation,
  japanese classes, tours.

National Laboratories

The US National Laboratories are large complexes with a number of
robotics efforts. One current focus is the enormous and costly cleanup
of the weapons complexes throughout the country. Remediation, removal
and cleanup of hazardous materials will require hundreds of billions
of $$$ and many years. Robotics will be a key in much of this.

[8.4] Small Inexpensive Robots
	One of the most common discussions on the net are related to
finding, building and working on small and low cost robots. There are
a few small robots on the market and a number of construction kits
that robots can be built from such as Lego, FischerTechnik and
Capsula. None of these require large investments. These systems are at
most several hundred $US and can run on a desktop. There are also a
number of kit robots that include printed-circuit boards and
components.

[Tom Thorton]
The HexWalker(tm) walking robot kit is based on the Insectoid built by
Gary Malolepsy of The Robotics Society of Southern California (RSSC),
and chronicled in the February, March and April 1994 issues of Robot
Builder (the newsletter of RSSC). The Insectoid robot was given
passing mention by Scott Edwards in the June 1994 issue of Nuts and
Volts (How Far Can a Stamp Take You?).

RSSC Club Officers had discussed kitting the walking robot up for
members for several months, but had taken no action. Finally, I built
one for myself. It generated so much attention at meetings that I
decided to kit it out. The HexWalker(tm) robot kit is the result.

As supplied in the kit the Hexwalker(tm) robot detects the world by
means of two feelers. Normal movement for HexWalker(tm) is to walk
forward using the opposing triangle gait. When the robot detects an
obstacle (when a feeler switch closes) it pauses, backs up several
steps, turns left or right, and resumes forward walking. HexWalker(tm)
turns left when the right feeler switch closes, or right when the left
feeler switch closes.

HexWalker(tm) is large enough to work on easily. It measures 8 1/2 inches 
(22cm) long (plus feelers), 6 1/2 inches (16cm) wide, and 2 1/2 inches 
(6cm) tall. It is strong, able to support its own weight (12 ounces) plus 
about an 8 ounce payload.

Modifying the basic robot is encouraged. Ideas for
modification/improvement include: Substitute LED photodetectors for
the feeler/snapswitch sensors. Add a second Stamp to HexWalker(tm)
that performs sensor monitoring functions. Add additional sensors
to HexWalker(tm).
  backup sensor to prevent walking into objects when walking backwards.
  down sensor to detect "cliffs" and prevent walking off edges.
  sonar for long range sensing."

HexWalker(tm) sells for US $125.00.
California residents add 7.75% sales tax.
Shipping throughout North America is US $3.00.
Shipping to all others is US $15.00.
The kit without Basic Stamp (if you have your own controller) is 
   US $100.00 plus s&h.
The construction manual alone is US $10.00 plus US $1.00 s&h.

_____________________________________________________________________________
[9] What is a Robot Architecture?

A robot 'architecture' primarily refers to the software and hardware
framework for controlling the robot. A VME board running C code to
turn motors doesn't really constitute an architecture by itself. The
development of code modules and the communication between them begins
to define the architecture.

Robotic systems are complex and tend to be difficult to develop. They
integrate multiple sensors with effectors, have many degrees of
freedom and must reconcile hard real-time systems with systems which
cannot meet real-time deadlines [Jones93]. System developers have
typically relied upon robotic architectures to guide the construction
of robotic devices and for providing computational services (e.g.,
communications, processing, etc.) to subsystems and components. These
architectures, however, have tended thus far to be task and domain
specific and have lacked suitability to a broad range of applications.
For example, an architecture well suited for direct teleoperation
tends not to be amenable for supervisory control or for autonomous
use.

One recent trend in robotic architectures has been a focus on
behavior-based or reactive systems. Behavior based refers to the fact
that these systems exhibit various behaviors, some of which are
emergent [Man92]. These systems are characterized by tight coupling
between sensors and actuators, minimal computation, and a
task-achieving "behavior" problem decomposition.

The other leading architectural trend is typified by a mixture of
asynchronous and synchronous control and data flow. Asychronous
processes are characterized as loosely coupled and event-driven
without strict execution deadlines. Synchronous processes, in
contrast, are tightly coupled, utilize a common clock and demand hard
real-time execution.
