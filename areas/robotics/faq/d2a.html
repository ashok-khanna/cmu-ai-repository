This article is a collection of information sources on Digital to Analog
Converters and Analog to Digital Converters (and related hardware).

NOTE : THIS IS A DRAFT - PLEASE SEND ANY COMMENTS TO rgetz@esd.nsc.com

Some of the below sections are blank - I thought I would ask for comments
before I finished the whole thing. The only sections that are **really**
semi-complete are 1) About this FAQ, 2) A/Ds, and 9) Definition of Terms
The rest I have sort of an outline - I would appreciate your comments.

I never included any manufacture info yet - All I had was National 
Semiconductor Stuff - & I did not think it was appropraite to post only
one manufacture (lest this be called advertising:)

If you would prefer not ever to see this again - I would appreciate comments
like that as well - if you think this is not appropriaet for this group,
that is OK too.

      We live in an analog world where the information we see, hear, 
      process and exchange with each other, and with our mechanical and 
      electronic systems, is always an analog quantity -- pressure, 
      temperature, voltage, current, air and water flow are always 
      analog entities. They can be digitized for more efficient sorting, 
      storage and transmittal, but the interface -- the input and output 
      -- is almost always analog. Thus the essence of analog electronics 
      lies in sensing continuously varying information, shaping and 
      converting it for the efficiency of digital processing and 
      transmission, and reshaping the digital data to an analog signal 
      at the other end.

                                    - National Semiconductor Corporation 
                                      1993 Annual Report

      It is too true - analog is everywhere. - And as microcontrollers 
      and other electronics pervade into everything we use (as 
      consumers) A/Ds, DACs will become more and more important.

      This document should provide a reference base to know what 
      questions to ask when looking at a A/D or DAC device. It is not 
      intended to be a end all or be all guide to purchasing you A/D or 
      DAC.

1)  ABOUT THIS FAQ

1.1)  Who put this FAQ together?

   I work for National Semiconductor in the Geographic Business Unit 
   responsible for New Business Development, so if you want to 
   call this advertising, and don't want me to continue to post this in 
   the future, please email me. I think that I have kept most of the 
   hype out - please let me know if you think otherwise. However - I intend 
   on this document having other manufactures in it as well - if you know 
   of anybody that should be listed in here - please let me know.

   However - I am doing this on my spare time (what little I have),
   and in no way get compensated for this by my employer.

   If sections of this FAQ appear in others (the Microcontroller Primer 
   that Russ Hersch maintains) it is because I wrote those sections, and 
   gave them to him - and then decided that they deserved their own FAQ. 
   Here it is. It is up to Russ to decide if he still wants to include 
   those sections in his or just point to this document.

1.2)  How can I contribute to this list?

   I please ask that if you have any suggestions or additions, or you
   would like to correct any of the information contained herein, please
   send me a note.

        My Email address is:  rgetz@esd.nsc.com
        My Smail address is:

              94086 

   I certainly hope that those of you who know of interesting items for
   this list will share with everyone by contributing to this list.

   If you are a manufacturer and have an anonymous ftp site available
   that supports A/Ds or DACs, please let me know by Email so that I can
   add it to this FAQ.


1.3)  What newsgroups will this FAQ be posted to?

   This FAQ will be posted to the following newsgroups (eventually):
         comp.realtime
         comp.robotics
         sci.electronics
         comp.answers (eventually)
         sci.answers (eventually)
         news.answers (eventually)

   Any other sugestions?

   The first four newsgroups often contain discussions, announcements,
   or information on things that you may find interesting if you are 
   reading this.  Check them out from time to time. By posting to the 
   *.answers newsgroups, the FAQ will automatically be archived. (If I
   get it approved - that is) 

   The schedule for posting will be once a month.  I can't promise that
   it will be on time, but I hope to post it on the 5th of each month.

   You might also want to check out the following newsgroups, since they
   occasionally have items of interest for analog users.

1.4)  May I post this FAQ to my local BBS?

   I am putting no restrictions on the use of this FAQ except - It must
   be distributed in its entirety with the copyright notice, and no
   financial gain may be realized from it.  After all, I have spent, and
   continue to spend, a lot of time on this, and the only thing that I
   intend to gain from it is more information on the A/Ds and DACs, and 
   getting to know my fellow analog groupies better.

   For this reason I have appended a copyright statement to the end of
   this FAQ.  I feel pretty silly doing this, but I just want to protect
   myself.  The copyright does not limit the use of this list for
   noncommercial purposes.  I hereby give my permission to one and all
   to pass this list around and post it wherever you want - as long as
   it is not for financial gain. (Unless it is for my financial gain :)

       Thank you.


1.5)  How about FAQs on other electronics?

   If anyone wishes to start a FAQ on something else about electronics, 
   please feel free to copy the format of this FAQ (I did). With a common 
   format, we will all benefit when trying to find information on a 
   particular device.  If anyone has any comments on the format 
   itself, I'm open for suggestions.

--------------------------------- End About this FAQ --------------------


2) A/D (Analog to Digital Converters)

2.1) What is a A/D?

    Converts an external analog signal (typically relative to voltage) 
    and converts it to a digital representation.  Systems that have this 
    feature are used everywhere - for instrumentation, environmental data 
    logging, any application that lives in an analog world.

    You can either get a stand-alone A/D converter, or one this is 
    integrated into your favorite Microcontroller. (see the 
    Microcontroller primer and FAQ referenced above) Some of the features 
    you will see described below are not available on your favorite 
    microcontroller - which is why you have a separate one.


2.2) Types of A/D converters

     Successive Approximation A/D converters:
       This the most common type of A/D and is used in the majority of 
       applications. In this technique, the converter figures out each 
       bit at a time (most significant first) and finds if the next step 
       is higher or lower. This way has some benefits - it takes exactly 
       the same amount of time for any conversion - it is very common - 
       (and therefore very cheap).  However it also has some 
       disadvantages - it is slow - for every bit it takes at least one 
       clock cycle - the best an 8-bit A/D can do is at least 8 clock 
       cycles (and a couple for housekeeping).  Because it takes so long 
       - it is a power hog as compared to the other types of A/Ds.

       Some SARs require an external clock, others have this built into 
       them. - Check your datasheet.

     Single Slope A/D converters
       This is the type of converter that you can build yourself (if you 
       are willing to provide a couple other components that all ready 
       may be in your system).  Your single slope A/D converter would 
       include Analog Mux / comparator / timer (8-bit timer = 8 bit A/D 
       / 16-bit timer = 16 bit A/D) with input capture and a constant 
       current source (or Voltage source).

       To do this by hand, the first Step is to clear the timer to 0000 
       and then start it.  It is a simple matter to charge an external 
       capacitor with the constant current source (linearly because of 
       the current source or exponential with Vcc) when the voltage on 
       the cap exceeds the sampling voltage, the comparator toggles, 
       stops the timer - and voila - you have the voltage in uSecs - 
       with 16-bit accuracy.  The only drawback is you can't really 
       expect 16 bits (14 yes) - the conversion time varies quite a bit, 
       and it is SLOW, but it draw **very** little current.

       There are also monolithic ICs that have all the above built into 
       them. They work exactly the same way as described above.

    Dual Slope A/D converters
       I am still working on this description.

    Delta-Sigma A/Ds converters 
      This type of converter is found on higher end systems. These are 
      the hardest to understand of the A/Ds because it just makes a best 
      guess (a little National Semiconductor humor here :-). Actually 
      Delta-Sigmas are very easy to understand if you break it down into 
      two main parts: 1) the modulator which does the A/D conversion and 
      2) the filter, which turns the output of the modulator into a 
      format suitable for your system (microcontroller or DSP).

      The modulator is very simple - it just compares the input voltage 
      to the average of the last 100 (or so) modulator outputs and 
      decides if the input is higher or lower than the average. This 
      happens millions of times a second, resulting in a high speed 
      single-bit datastream of 1s and 0s who's *average* is equal to the 
      input voltage. Because the output is only a one or a zero, there are 
      very few sources of errors. This is the main reason that delta-
      sigma A/Ds are **very** accurate.

      The filter comes after the modulator ... and this filter is 
      essentially a big DSP block.  It must take the very high speed 
      stream of ones and zeros and turn it into a slower speed stream of 
      6-bit (or greater) words to be used by the microcontroller.  This 
      process is called decimation and the filter is often called a 
      "comb filter".  Another digital filter follows this stage and 
      rejects unwanted frequencies.  This filter performs a similar 
      function to the anti-aliasing filter required in many traditional 
      A/D applications, but it does it at an unprecedented level of 
      performance and at low cost.  This is the other major benefit of 
      delta-sigma A/Ds.

    Flash A/D converters
      This is the basic architecture for the fastest category of A/Ds. 
      The flash converter involves looking at each level that is 
      possible and instantaneously saying what level the voltage is at. 
      This is done by setting up comparators as threshold detectors with 
      each detector being set up for a voltage exactly 1 LSB higher than 
      the detector below it.  The benefit of this architecture is that 
      with a single clock cycle, you can tell exactly what the input 
      voltage is - that is why it is so fast. The disadvantage is that 
      to achieve 8-bit accuracy you need 256 comparators and to achieve 
      10-bit accuracy you need 1024 comparators. To make these 
      comparators operate at higher speeds, they have to draw LOTS of 
      current, and beyond the 10-bit number comparators required becomes 
      totally unmanageable. (12 bits = 4096 comparators / 16 bits = 
      65,536 comparators)

    Dual-Flash A/D converters
      This is basically a FLASH A/D, that is ran through twice (hence the 
      name dual). The first time the Flash is run (on a ten bit system) - 
      it determines the upper 5 MSB. The flash then adjust itself to 
      determine the lower 5 LSB. Two Clock cycles = 10 bits of resolution, 
      but since only 5 bits are determined at a time, you only need 32 
      comparators ( as compared to 1024 comparators for a 10-bit FLASH). 
      This consumes less power, less silicon ( = less costly),but it 
      slightly slower than a "true" flash device.

    Voltage to Frequency converters:
      The output of this device is a pulse train at a frequency precisely 
      proportional to the applied voltage input. In this way - all you have 
      to do is measure the frequency to determine the voltage. This can be 
      done with a 8-bit microcontroller that has a 16-bit timer to get 
      A/D conversion resolution of 16-bits.

    Serial:

    Parallel:

2.3) Additional Features

    Bipolar or Unipolar Inputs:
      A unipolar input is an input that will only accept and measure either 
      positive and negative voltages (input voltage can not swing past 0). 
      A bipolar input is an input that will except and measure both 
      positive and negative voltages. This usually means on a 12 bit system 
      you only have 11 bits of resolution (11 bits + sign = 12 bits). And 
      volia the 13-bit A/D converter was born.

    Differential Input:
      Usually inputs are referenced with respect to some Vref (usually high 
      - some other input pin or Vcc) and ground. On an 8-bit system, if 
      Vref = 5V and the input measured was 4.000V the output would be 
      (256steps/5V * 4.000V) = 204d (11001100b). With a differential input 
      the difference between two inputs is given. On the same system, a 
      differential measurement is taken between two inputs, the first at 
      4.0000V, the second at 3.5000V, the output would be (256step/5volts * 
      (4.0000V - 3.5000V) ) = 25d (0001001b). (The opposite of differential 
      is single-ended)

    Internal/External Clocks:
      All A/D converters need some type of clock (with the exception of 
      FLASH). This clock can either be external or internal. Internal saves 
      you some external components, external allows you to determine how 
      fast things run (and how much power is consumed)

    LCD/LED Drive:
      Some A/D chips are designed specifically for Digital Volt Meters 
      (DVM). The device does the conversion, and the BCD to Seven Segment 
      decoding - all on the same chip.

    Low voltage:
      Most A/Ds are require 5 or 15 volts as Vcc. Now some manufactures are 
      providing A/Ds that can operate on less (3.3 and lower) voltage. If 
      you need 3 Volt operation - now you can get it. (but it will cost
      you)

    Multiplexer:
      This is what gives the A/D the ability to sample 8-channels with only 
      one A/D conversion block inside. It is simply a bank of switches that 
      only let one input through to the A/D block at one time. On a 
      8-channel system - you must convert one channel at a time - switching 
      each of the 8 channels into the A/D block, one at a time.

    Self Calibrating:
      These devices will go through a self-adjusting cycle that adjust for 
      any zero, full scale, or linearity errors. Some self-calibrating A/Ds 
      also have the ability to go through an Auto-Zero cycle that corrects 
      the zero error during every conversion. This is usually needed for 
      systems that will vary in temperature drastically.

    Track and Hold:
      If a A/D has a track an hold, it does not require an external Sample 
      and Hold. (it does not have a track and hold - it is up to the 
      system designer to decide where or not the system requires one or 
      not). The functionality is the same of a sample and hold. (see 
      section 6.1)

    Voltage Reference:
      Every accurate A/D system **must** have a rock solid voltage 
      reference. The digital output of an A/D is dependent on two inputs - 
      the input being measured and the voltage reference. (Garbage in - 
      Garbage out). Lots of system problems on a A/D can be lead back to 
      either a noisy Vref, one that varies with temperature, one the 
      spikes, etc.

3)  DAS (Data Acquisition System)

3.1) What is a DAS

    A Data Acquisition System is an integrated Analog to Digital converter, 
    internal voltage reference, multiplexer, RAM and (usually volatile) 
    program memory. This program memory is used to store a small program 
    that tell the DAS how to operate. Most DASs have the ability to operate 
    in a variety of modes - Watchdog, setting interrupts, setting which 
    channels are converted and how (differential or single-ended), Auto A/D 
    conversions, providing status, and power-up information.

    A DAS is a great for the system that typically monitors some analog 
    signal. You can set it up in watchdog mode, and let it go - your 
    microcontroller (or microprocessor) can do it's thing until the DAS 
    interrupts it (i.e. one of the Analog signals went out of the bounds 
    you set up in watchdog mode)

3.2) Types of DAS

    Most DASes have the same types as an A/D (see section 2.2) most 
    being SARs, but have differing modes of operation:

    Serial:

    Parallel:

    DMA:

3.3) Additional Features

    Most DASes have the same features as an A/D (see section 2.3) but there 
    are differences between DASes. Some DASes have differing modes of 
    operation:

    Power Failure Detection - During normal operation, a power flag is 
    reset to zero after the fist read-cycle and will be "updated" to a "1" 
    only if a power interruption occurs. This is very handy because while 
    the DAS may still be operating in the mode you want - the limits may 
    have changed (brown out or power spike).

    WatchDog -

    Write One Limit

    One A/D conversion

    Read One Limit

    Test

    Write All Limits

    Auto A/D Conversion

    Read All Limits

    Some DASes actually have programs (event sequencers) with difference 
    instructions:

    LOOP

    PAUSE

    Channel Select:

    SYNC:

    TIMER:

    RESOLUTION SELECTION:

    WATCHDOG ENABLE:

4) DAC (Digital to Analog Converters)

4.1) What is a DAC

    This feature takes a Digital number and converts it to a analog output. 
    The number 50 would be changed to the analog output of (50/256 * 
    5Volts) = .9765625V on a 8-bit / 5 Volt system.

4.2) Types of DACs

    Multipling DAC:
      In a sence, every DAC is a multiplying DAC since the output voltage 
      (of current) is equal to the reference voltage times a constant 
      determined by the digital input code divided by 2^n (n is the number 
      of bits of resolution). In a two quadrant muliplying DAC the 
      referance voltage or the ditigal input code can change the output 
      polarity. If both can chnage the output voltage polarity, a four 
      quadrant muliplication exists.

9) Definition of Terms

    The following definitions are used to describe A/Ds, and DACs. Most of 
    these definitions were founf in the 1993 Data Acquisition Databook 
    printed by National Semiconductor. If you have any others that you 
    think should be in here, please email me.

    Acquisition Time:
      The timer required to acquire a new analog input voltage once a 
      sample command has been given. A signal is "acquired" when it has 
      settled within a specified errorband around its final value of output 
      voltage. The maximum value of the acquisition time occurs when the 
      hold capacitor must change to a full scale voltage change. Note that 
      the acquisition time is not just the time required for the input to 
      settle, but also includes the time required for all internal nodes to 
      settle so that the output assumes the proper value when switched to 
      the hold mode.

    Aperture Jutter:
      The uncertainty in the aperture time. Aperture jutter results from 
      the noise which is superimposed on the hold command which affects 
      it's timing.

    Aperture Time:
      The delay required between "Hold" command and an input analog 
      transition, so that the transition does not effect the held output.

    Conversion Time:
      The time required for a complete measurement by an analog-to-digital 
      converter.

    DC Common-Mode Error:
      This specification applies to A/Ds with differential inputs. It is 
      the change in the output code that occurs when the analog voltages on 
      the two inputs are changed by and equal amount. It is expressed in 
      LSBs.

    Differential Nonlinerarity:
      Differential nonlinerarity is a measure of the worst case deviation 
      from the 1 LSB input voltage span that is associated with each output 
      code. Differential Nonlinerarity may be expressed in fractional bits 
      or as a percentage of full scale. A Differential Nonlinerarity 
      greater than 1 LSB will lead to missing codes in an ADC. In a DAC 
      Differential Nonlinerarity greater than 1 LSB will lead to a non-
      monotonic transfer function.

    Droop Rate:
      The rate at which the output voltage is changing in hold mode as a 
      result to leakage from the hold capacitor.

    Dynamic sampling error:
      The error introduced into the held output due to a changing analog 
      input at the time the hold command is given. Error is expressed in mV 
      with a given hold capacitor value and input slew rate. Note that this 
      error term occurs even for long sample times.

    Dynamic Specifications:
      The specifications of an A/D pertaining to an AC input signal. These 
      included S/N (Signal to Noise) ration, SINAD(Signal-to-Noise + 
      Distortion Ratio), ENOB (Effective Number of Bits), THD (Total 
      Harmonic Distortion), IMD (Intermodulation Distortion), FPBW (Full 
      Power Bandwidth), and SSBW (Small Signal Band Width).

    Effective Number of Bits (ENOB):
      The ENOB of an A/D is determined from measurement of its SINAD from 
      the following equation: ENOB= (SINAD - 1.76) / 6.02. This 
      specification combines the effects of many of the other dynamic 
      specifications; errors resulting from dynamic differential and 
      integral nonlinearity, missing codes, THD, and aperture jutter shown 
      up in ENOB.

    Feedthrough Attenuation Ratio:
      The fraction of the input signal that appears at the output while the 
      sample and hold is in hold mode.

    FIFO (First In - First Out):
      Usually describes the size of the buffer on a serial or parallel 
     transmission - the device can make the conversion, put the value in 
     the FIFO, and wait until the controller or processor is read before 
     sending information.

    Full Power Bandwidth (FPBW)
      The frequency at which the S/N ration has dropped 3 dB (relative to 
      its low frequency level) for an input signal that is at or near-full 
      scale. This corresponds to a drop in ENOB by 1/2 bit relative to its 
      low frequency level.

    Gain Error (Full Scale Error)
      The difference (usually expressed in LSBs) between in a A/D the input 
      voltage that should ideally produce a full scale output code and the 
      actual input voltage that produces that code; and in a DAC the output 
      voltage (or current) and the ideal output voltage ( or current) that 
      should exist with a full scale input code.

    Gain Temperature Coefficient (Full Scale Temperature Coefficient):
      Change in gain error divided by change in temperature. Usually 
      expressed in parts per million per degree Celsius (ppm/C).

    Hold Capacitor Leakage Current:
      The current which flows into or out of the hold capacitor while the 
      S/H is in hold mode.

    Hold Settling Time:
      The time required for the output to settle within a specified error 
      band after the "hold" logic command has been given.

    Hold Step:
      The voltage step at the output of the S/H when switching from sample 
      to hold mode with a steady (DC) analog input voltage.

    Integral Nonlinearity (Linearity Error):
      Worst Case deviation of an ADC or DAC transfer function from the line 
      between the endpoints (zero and full scale). Can be expressed as a 
      percentage of full scale or in fractions of an LSB.

    Intermodulation Distortion (IMD):
      Two frequency components in a signal will interact through the 
      nonlinerarities in an A/D to produce signal at additional 
      frequencies. IMD is commonly defined as the ratio of the rms sum of 
      the distortion product amplitudes to the rms sum of the input 
      frequency amplitudes.

    LSB (Least-Significant Bit):
      In a binary coded systems this is the bit that carries the smallest 
      value or weight. Its value is the full scale voltage (or current) 
      divided by 2^n, where n is the resolution of the converter.

    Missing Codes:
      When an incremental increase or decrease in input voltage causes the 
      converter to increment or decrement its numeric output by more than 
      one LSB the converter is said to exhibit "missing codes". If there 
      are missing codes, there are digital codes which cannot be reached by 
      input voltage value.

    Monotonicity:
      A monotonic function has a slope whose sign does not change. A 
      monotonic DAC has an output that changes in the same direction (or 
      remains constant) for each increase in the input code. The converse 
      is true for decreasing codes.

    MSB (Most Significant Bit):
      In a binary coded system this is the bit that has the largest value 
      or weight. Its value is one half of full scale.

    Offset Error (Zero Error):
      This is the difference between the ideal voltage (1/2 LSB) and the 
      actual input voltage that is needed to make the transition from zero 
      to 1 LSB. All the digital codes in the transfer curve are offset by 
      the same value. Offset Error is usually expressed in LSBs.

    Output Logic Levels:
      Defines the voltage and current output characteristics of the device 
      can be any combination of TTL, CMOS, TRI-STATE, or Open Collector.

    Peak Harmonic:
      The amplitude, relative to the fundamental, of the largest harmonic 
      resulting from the A/D conversion of a AC signal.

    Power Supply Sensitivity (Power supply rejection):
      The sensitivity of a converter to changes in the dc power supply 
      voltages.

    Quantizing Error:
      The error inherent in all A/D conversions. Since even an "ideal" 
      converter has finite resolution, any analog voltage that falls 
      between two adjacent output codes will result in an output code that 
      is inaccurate by up to 1/2 LSB.

    Ratiometric Operation:
      Many A/D applications require a stable and accurate reference voltage 
      against which the input voltage is compared. This approach results in 
      an absolute conversion. Some Applications, however, use transducers 
      or other signal sources whose output voltages are proportional to 
      some external references. In these ratiometric applications, the 
      references for the signal source should be connected to the reference 
      of the converter. Thus, any variations in the source reference 
      voltage will also change the converter reference voltage and produce 
      an accurate conversion.
 
    Resolution:
      The smallest analog increment corresponding to a 1 LSB converter code 
      change. For converters, resolution is normally expressed in bits, 
      where the number of digital codes is equal to 2^n. As an example a 
      12-bit converter maps the analog signal into 12^12 = 4096 digital 
      codes.

    Sample-to-Hold Transient:
      The transient that appears at the output due to a sample-to-hold 
      transition.

    Settling Time:
      The time from a change in input code until a DAC's output signal 
      remains within +/- 1/2 LSB (or some other specified tolerance) of the 
      final value.

    Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N)
      The ratio of the signal amplitude to the background noise level. The 
      background noise is determined by integrating the noise spectral 
      density over the bandwidth of interest.

    SINAD (Signal-to-Noise + Distortion Ratio)
      Similar to the S/N ratio, the SINAD includes harmonic distortion 
      components as part of the same noise.

    Serial I/O
      UART - A UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) is a 
          serial port adapter for asynchronous serial communications.

      USART - A USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver 
          Transmitter) is a serial port adapter for either asynchronous or 
          synchronous serial communications.  Communications using 
          synchronous mode are typically much faster (as much as 16 times) 
          than with asynchronous mode.

      Synchronous serial port - A synchronous serial port doesn't require 
          start/stop bits and can - operate at much higher clock rates than 
          an asynchronous serial port. A few common types of synchronous 
          serial communication protocols are:
            SPI (Motorola) - An SPI (serial peripheral interface) is a 
               synchronous serial port.
            I2C bus - Inter-Integrated Circuit bus (Philips) - The I2C bus 
               is a simple 2 wire serial interface developed by Philips. It 
               was developed for 8 bit applications and is widely used in 
               consumer electronics, automotive and industrial 
               applications.
             MICROWIRE & MICROWIRE/PLUS (National Semiconductor) - 
               MICROWIRE is a serial synchronous bi-directional 
               communications interface. MICROWIRE/PLUS has some 
               enhancements that are not found in MICROWIRE.

    Small Signal Bandwidth (SSBW)
      The frequency at which the S/N ratio has dropped by 3dB (relative to 
      its low frequency level) for an input signal that is much smaller 
      than the full scale input (20dB or 40dB below full-scale, for 
      example).

    Static Specifications:
      The specifications of a A/D pertaining to a DC signal input. These 
      include gain error, offset error, and differential and integral 
      linearity errors.

    Supply:
      Denotes the required power supply. Can be any combination of +/-5, 
      and +/- 12 Volts. 

    Throughput Time:
      The time is takes from addressing the analog input channels till 
      valid data is read on the output. In the case of some systems (such 
      as National's LM12454/8 DAS family) this includes the sequencer 
      instruction, selecting the proper multiplexer input channels and 
      waiting for them to settle, the conversion time of the A/D, storing
      the results in the FIFO, sending a data request, and one clock cycle 
      for the read to occur.

    Throughput rate:
      The inverse of the throughput time.

    Total Harmonic Distortion (THD):
      Due to inherent nonlinearities even in an ideal A/D transfer 
      function, A/D's will produce harmonics of the input frequency. THD is 
      defined as the ratio of the rms sum of the harmonic distortion 
      product amplitudes to the input signal amplitude.

    Total Unadjusted Error (TUE):
      The maximum deviation of the voltage corresponding to the center of a 
      digital code's associated input voltage span from the ideal case. 
      Total unadjusted error includes offset error, gain error, and 
      differential nonlinearity errors.

    Watchdog Mode:
      This mode of operation is used to monitor an analog input's amplitude 
      to two preset (and programmable) limits. An interrupt signal can be 
      generated if the input signal is above or below either of the two 
      limits. As the preset limits are fed into the successive 
      approximation A/D internal D/A, and then compared to the input 
      signal, the watchdog mode can provide a quick and accurate assessment 
      of a possible alarm condition.
