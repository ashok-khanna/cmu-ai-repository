Summary:      Archives for the comp.robotics newsgroup

Version:      May 1990 to present

Description:

   This directory contains archives for the comp.robotics newsgroup.  The new
   articles are archived once a week, in a gzipped tar file of the form
   YY_MM_DD.tgz, where YY, MM, and DD are replaced with the year, month,
   and day, respectively. Most archiving began with 94_09_14.tgz, which
   includes articles since 23-JUL-94.

   The archives from May 1990 through August 1994 were obtained by
   reorganizing the contents of the wilma.cs.brown.edu archive. 
       
Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.robotics/

              comp.robotics is also archived independently on
