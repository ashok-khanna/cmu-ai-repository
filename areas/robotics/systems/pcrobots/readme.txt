To unpack the archive use the PKUNZIP program - type 'pkunzip -d pcrob13'
as several subdirectories are used.

To contact the author via email use one of these addresses:
 psmithb@cix.compulink.co.uk  (preferred mail address)
 paul@wolf.demon.co.uk

Alternatively, you can talk to him in the 'crobots' conference on
CIX in the UK. Type 'join crobots' at the CIX 'Main:' prompt, and
look in the 'pcrobots' topic. This topic will usually be read
several times a day.
To join CIX, call 081 390 1244 (up to 2400 baud) or 081 390 1255
(up to V32bis/V42bis) with your modem and register online
(2.40ukp/hour off-peak)

On Compuserve, the best area to discuss this is probably
IBMNEW/Gen_Fun_and_games. However, due to financial reasons, the
author probably won't be able to log onto CI$ more than once or
twice a week, so urgent messages should be sent to him at the CIX
address (mail to '>INTERNET:psmithb@cix.compulink.co.uk').

On USENET, the best area is probably rec.games.corewar, as this
seems to be where programming type games are discussed. This
newsgroup will usually be read every day or two (as will mail to
paul@wolf.demon.co.uk).

PASCAL
=======
I'm not a Pascal programmer, so there may be errors/omissions in the
Pascal libraries - I'll be welcome to make any modifications as
necessary. It's hard for me to test these files as I only have access
to TP 5.0 which is a bit out of date...

BASIC
======
The .BAS and .BI files are for compiled QuickBasic. As I (again)
don't have this compiler I've relied on someone else for these files.
(The author in this case is pclements@cix.compulink.co.uk).

C(++)
=====
These libraries are all mine, so I'm the one to blame if there's
any mistakes here...
