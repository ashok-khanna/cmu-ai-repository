Sorry, I cannot assume the task of mailing out hardcopies of code or
papers.  My volunteer time assisting people with their queries on my
codes and papers must be limited to electronic mail correspondence.

			00README
This is a link to 00index.

			00index
This file.

			0lower.dir
This directory contains links to other frequently accessed files and
directories whose names contain capital letters, causing problems for
some systems.  /pub/ingber/0lower.dir/00index_lower (linked to
0index_l) is an index file for this directory.

			ASA-x.y-shar.Z
This is a link to ASA-shar.Z.  x & y are current version numbers.

			ASA-x.y.tar.Z
This is a link to ASA.tar.Z.

			ASA-x.y.tar.gz
This is a link to ASA.tar.gz.

			ASA-x.y.zip
This is a link to ASA.zip.

			ASA-shar
This is an uncompress'd copy of ASA-shar.Z.  If you do not have sh or
unshar, you still can delete the first-column X's and separate the
files at the END_OF_FILE locations.

			ASA-shar.Z
This is a compress'd shar'd file of the current ASA code.

			ASA.tar.Z
This is a compress'd tar'd file of the current ASA code.

			ASA.tar.gz
This is a gzip'd tar'd file of the current ASA code.

			ASA.zip
This is a zip'd file of the current ASA code.  All files have been
processed through unix2dos.

			LIMBO.DIR
This is a "blind" directory which cannot be viewed using `ls' or
`dir'.  To retrieve a file from this directory, after `cd LIMBO.DIR'
(and `binary'), you must know its precise name; then `get file'.

			MISC.DIR
This directory holds some miscellaneous papers and files.
/pub/ingber/MISC.DIR/00index_misc is an index file for this directory.

			UTILS.DIR
In this directory are files and instructions for retrieval of
utilities, such as gzip and unshar, for DOS, MAC, UNIX, and VMS
systems.  /pub/ingber/UTILS.DIR/00index_utils is an index file for this
directory.  gzip will expand .gz and .Z files.

			asa_new
This file contains a list of major changes in ASA since the last
announcement to the ASA_list.  This can be used as a quick guide to
determine if you should download the latest ASA code in the archive
before the next announcement.

			asa_papers
This is an addendum to the NOTES file in the ASA code, listing some
(p)reprints that have used ASA or its precursor VFSR.
