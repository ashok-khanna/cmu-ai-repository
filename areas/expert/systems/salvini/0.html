<H2>PROTEST: Prolog Expert System Building Tool</H2>

This is a cut-down version of the expert system building tool produced
by Steven Salvini as part of his M.Sc. dissertation in 1986. 

PROTEST is a tool for building prototype expert systems.  It accepts a
knowledge base written in IF-THEN rules whose conditions and conclusions
consist of object/attribute/value triples:

    rule1:
        if
                pain/duration/constant
            and
                pain/localisation/accurate
            and
                pain/'initiated by'/'gentle touch'
            and
                pain/character/'sudden onset'
            and
                pain/character/'intense & throbbing'
            and
                gingivae/swelling/present
            and
                gingivae/erythema/present
            and
                miscellaneous/'local lymphadenopathy'/present
            and
                pain/'initiated by'/'clenching, biting or chewing'
            and
                tooth/mobility/present
        then
            diagnosis/group/abscess
        with
            certainty(0.9).

Conclusions may contain certainty factors.

Inference can be either backward chaining or mixed. The former is
normal backward chaining, giving a single firm conclusion if one has
been deduced or else as a list of possible conclusions in order of
their certainties.

Mixed mode is a "mixed" inference strategy which first prompts you to
enter your initial findings and then tries to deduce one or more of
the goals. If a firm conclusion is not reached, it then tries to solve
the problem by backward-chaining.

After PROTEST has given a conclusion, you can ask to see its chain of
reasoning.

A sample knowledge base, for dental diagnosis, is included.
