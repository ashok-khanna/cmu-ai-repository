Summary:      Free and portable expert system teaching system.

Version:      2.03 (1-APR-91), 2.50

Description: 

   MIKE (Micro Interpreter for Knowledge Engineering) is a full-featured,
   free, and portable software environment designed for teaching purposes
   at the UK's Open University.  It includes forward and backward
   chaining rules with user-definable conflict resolution strategies, and
   a frame representation language with inheritance and 'demons' (code
   triggered by frame access or change), plus user-settable inheritance
   strategies.  Automatic 'how' explanations (proof histories) are
   provided for rule execution, as are user-specified 'why' explanations.
   Coarse-grained and fine-grained rule tracing facilities are provided,
   along with a novel 'rule graph' display which concisely shows the
   history of rule execution.  MIKE, which forms the kernel of an Open
   University course on Knowledge Engineering, is written in a
   conservative and portable subset of Edinburgh-syntax Prolog, and is
   distributed as non-copy-protected source code. 

   MIKE version 1 was described in the October/November 1990 issue of
   BYTE. MIKE v1.50, which was formerly available from a range of ftp
   servers, has been superseded by two newer versions: MIKEv2.03, a full
   Prolog source code version, incorporating a RETE algorithm for fast
   forward chaining, a truth maintenance system, uncertainty handling,
   and hypothetical worlds, and MIKEv2.50, a turnkey DOS version with
   menu-driven interface and frame- and rule-browsing tools, fully
   compatible with MIKEv2.03, but without source code.
