Name:         CLIPS

Summary:      C Language Integrated Production System

Description:

   CLIPS 6.0 (C Language Integrated Production System) is an OPS-like
   forward chaining production system written in ANSI C by NASA. The
   CLIPS inference engine includes truth maintenance, dynamic rule
   addition, and customizable conflict resolution strategies.  CLIPS,
   including the runtime version, is easily embeddable in other
   applications.  CLIPS includes an object-oriented language called COOL
   (CLIPS Object-Oriented Language) which is directly integrated with the
   inference engine.  
   
   Joseph Giarratano and Gary Riley's book, "Expert Systems Principles
   and Practice", comes with an MS-DOS CLIPS 6.0 interpreter.

Requires:     ANSI C

Ports:        CLIPS runs on many platforms including IBM PC
              compatibles (including Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 386
              versions), Macintosh, VAX 11/780, Sun 3/260, and HP9000/500.
              Porting to any system with an ANSI C compiler should be easy.

Copying:      CLIPS is available from COSMIC at a nominal fee for
              unlimited copies with no royalties. (CLIPS is available
              free to NASA, USAF, and their contractors for use on
              NASA and USAF projects.) Folks who obtain CLIPS from
              COSMIC can do anything they wish with it, including
              redistribute it.  Folks who obtain CLIPS directly from
              NASA are restricted to using it for US government
              purposes only.
