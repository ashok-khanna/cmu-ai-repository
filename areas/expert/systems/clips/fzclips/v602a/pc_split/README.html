This directory contains the PC version of FuzzyCLIPS 6.02 in two
pieces rather than the one file fzclips.exe. This is for those users
who cannot cope with a file size larger than 1.4 MB.

The files are:

     fzexec.exe
     fzsource.exe


They should be downloaded in binary mode and executed to unpack the
necessary files.

eg.  mkdir \fzcl602A
     fzexec /path

(the /path is necessary to retain the directory structures)
