Version:      5.1 (23-FEB-93); 6.0 (28-MAY-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains the CLIPS 5.1 and 6.0 Reference Manual and User
   Guide in Macintosh RTF and PostScript formats. The PostScript
   version was dumped in Word for Windows, so we've also included
   a version that has been "fixed" with fixwfwps.

   Also included is a version of the CLIPS 6.0 Reference Manual (three
   volumes) and User's Guide converted and tested by Jan Willems
   <janw@cs.ruu.nl>. See 6docs.tgz.
