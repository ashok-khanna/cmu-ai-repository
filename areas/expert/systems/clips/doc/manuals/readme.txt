Hi CLIPS users

I am delighted to add one more piece of information to the CLIPS family.
CLIPS mannuals are available in .rtf or .doc or ascii format. I thought
I can contribute in making life easier for Unix Clips users.

Here are the manuals, which I have successfully (I hope !!) converted 
to .ps from already existing .rtf. 

                     CLIPS_RefI.ps.Z
                     CLIPS_RefII.ps.Z
                     CLIPS_RefIII.ps.Z
                     UserguideI.ps.Z
                     UserguideII.ps.Z

These files are on "as exists" basis and neither I nor my Institute take
any responsibility for them.


Enjoy discovering CLIPS !!!

Cheers

Rajesh Ransing
