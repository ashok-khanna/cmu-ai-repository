Summary:      DYNAamic CLIPS Utilities

Version:      3.1 (7-SEP-94); 3.0 (22-APR-94); 2.0 (14-MAR-94)

Description: 

   DYNACLIPS (DYNAamic CLIPS Utilities), is a set of blackboard, dynamic
   knowledge exchange, and agent tools for CLIPS 5.1 and 6.0.  It is
   implemented as a set of libraries that can be linked with CLIPS 5.1
   and 6.0.  Versions 3.0 and 3.1 will work with both
   CLIPS 5.1 and CLIPS 6.0. Source code is not available. Agents
   use the blackboard to communicate with other intelligent agents in the
   framework.  Each intelligent agent can send and receive facts, rules,
   and commands.  Rules and facts are inserted and deleted dynamicly
   while the agents are running.  Knowledge can be transferred on a
   temporary or permanent basis.

   Versions 1.0 and 2.0 have been superseded by later versions and are
   no longer supported. (Version 1.0 was used with CLIPS 5.1 and version 2.0
   with CLIPS 6.0. Versions 3.0 and later work with both CLIPS 5.1 and 6.0.)

Requires:     CLIPS 5.1 (UNIX), CLIPS 6.0 (UNIX).
