Name:         FRulekit

Summary:      Frame-based RETE production system.

Version:      25-AUG-93

Description: 

   FRulekit is a frame-based RETE production system written in Common
   Lisp. It uses the Parmenides frame-based knowledge representation
   system as the working memory elements (i.e., the rules match against
   and modify Parmenides frames). 

   In addition to the standard OPS5 conflict resolution strategies, it
   allows users to write their own conflict resolution strategies, and
   incorporates an agenda system for controlling the order of rules.

Requires:     Parmenides, Common Lisp

Ports:        

Origin:       
              
Copying:      Frulekit and Parmenides are available at no charge for people
              and institutions who wish to use it on a non-profit basis.  If
              you plan to use it in a commercial application, arrangements
              should be made with the author.
