Dear Researcher,



It is my pleasure to make available to the community the suite of rule
benchmark programs and data generators my group has assembled.

You are welcome to collect and use them with citation and at your own
risk.  If you have bug patches we will be happy to update our files
for the community's benefit.  If you have a bug report we might try to
fix it for you.

If you do use them we would like you to register, just so we know who
you are by sending an email note to "ops5suite@cs.utexas.edu".  Patches
and additions should also be sent to that address.



To collect the suite anonymous ftp to

cs.utexas.edu

and connect to 

pub/ops5-benchmark-suite
n

Following is a the current listing of the directory.

cs31> ls
README            waltz.clp.tar     waltzdb.tar.Z
arp.tar.Z         waltz.clp.tar.Z   weaver.clp.tar.Z
manners.tar.Z     waltz.tar.Z       weaver.tar.Z
cs32>


This directory includes the OPS5 programs and data generators described
in 

@inproceedings{brantetal91,
Author="D.A. Brant and T. Grose and B. Lofaso and D.P. Miranker",
year ="1991",
title="{Effects of Database Size on Rule System Performance:Five Case Studies}",
booktitle="Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on
Very Large Data Bases (VLDB)"
}



There are also clips versions of a couple of the programs.

We are willing to add additional rule programs and generators to the
suite.  If you have one you think should be added, not necessarily in
OPS5, let us know.  The manners program can easily be made to work on
the data used in the Wisconsin DB benchmark suite.  I would personally
be interested if someone replaces our data generator with a Wisconsin
generator.


Sincerely,

Daniel Miranker
