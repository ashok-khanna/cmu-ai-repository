Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a genealogy of AI thesis-advising
   relationships. Although intended to complement citation analysis
   and free-text information retrieval as tools for understanding the AI
   community and their connections to other disciplines, it should also
   be useful to prospective graduate students. 2,600 MS and PhD theses
   have been tabulated so far. If you'd like to contribute additional
   listings, including year, title, abstract, school, advisor, committee
   members, and subsequent employment, write to Rik Belew for the
   questionnaire (see below for contact info).
