*Reading for Dreamers - Virtual Reality and CyberSpace 'Reference' List*
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I've seen the postings regarding 'Yo People!'.  I've been interested in the
ideas behind VR for *quite* a while, and have found various references to, and
discussions of the ideas behind it in some of the material below.  The list
is by no means exhaustive, and has some items that should be reasonably
easy to find. Some of the items may be available in the UK only.
 
 
        1/ Magazine and Newspaper Articles
 
 
        [a]  'Interfaces for Advanced Computing'; James D Foley,
              Scientific American, October 1987, (Advanced Computing issue).
 
              The first thing I saw specifically about VR, apart from
              cyberspace and cyberpunk SF stories.  This issue of Scientific
              American is worth seeking out, as it covers other new computer
              technology issues.
 
        [b]  'Between Man And Machine'; Ernest R Tello,
             BYTE magazine, September 1988.
 
             Similar in scope to [a].
 
        [c]  'The Road to the Global Village'; Karen Wright,
             Scientfic American, March 1990.
 
             Longish piece, puts VR in the context of emerging global
             communications technology.
 
        [d]  'Cyberspace:The Final Frontier'; Mark Heley,
             i-d magazine, January/February 1990. (UK publication)
 
             NB - i-d is a 'style' magazine, and this namechecks stuff
             like VPL, MONDO 2000, and cyberpunk, etc.
 
        [e]  'From Here To Reality'; Jim McClellan,
             The Face magazine, November 1989. (UK publication)
 
             Similar in scope to [d].
 
        [f]  'Participative Fiction'; Charles Platt,
             Interzone, March-April 1990. (UK publication)
 
             Suggests VR ideas may replace conventional (written) fiction.
             Interzone is a UK based SF magazine, available in America and
             other countries.
 
        [g]  'Virtually a perfect world'; Bob Swain,
             The Guardian, Thursday June 14th 1990. (UK newspaper)
 
        [h]  'Active video: it's out of this world'; Sam Kiley,
             The Sunday Times, Sunday June 17th 1990. (UK newspaper)
 
        [i]  'Realm of near reality'; Jack Schofield,
             The Guardian, Thursday July 26th 1990. (UK newspaper)
 
        [j]  'Virtual Reality'; Frank Hayes,
             UNIX WORLD, August 1990.
 
        [k]  'Virtual Reality'; Marc De Groot,
             Unix Review, Vol 8 number 8, September 1990.
 
        [l]  BYTE magazine, July 1990, full of articles on
             'Computing Without Keyboards', including datagloves.
 
             A *must read* issue of BYTE, mentioned in sci.virtual-worlds
             some time ago.
 
        [a], [b], [c], and [l], IMHO, make good background references.
 
 
 
        2/ Books
 
 
        [a]  'THE MEDIA LAB'; Stewart Brand,
             1987/1988, Penguin, ISBN 0-14-009701-5 (paper).
 
             The above is an absolute *MUST* read. Covers VR, multimedia,
             AI, highly parallel processing, graphics, communication etc.
             *LOTS* of ideas and *very readable*.
 
 
        [b]  'MIND CHILDREN'; Hans Moravec,
             1988, Harvard University Press, ISBN 0-674-57616-0 (paper)
             and ISBN 0-674-57618-7 (cloth).
 
             The above is a good read. Visualizes VR ideas in the book; covers
             the projected evolution of computer/cybernetic systems into a
             replacement for humankind. *Provocative* to some humanists or
             those concerned with 'mind/body split' philosophical ideas.
             I believe this book attracted some attention.
 
 
 
        3/ Books discussing technology/concepts Virtual Realities (may) need
 
        These don't specifically mention VR, but may be important to the
        potential requirements of VR, IMHO.
 
 
        [a]  'The Connection Machine'; W Daniel Hillis,
             1985, 1987, MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-08157-1 (cloth). Paperback
             available.
 
             Dicusses one model of *highly* parallel processing, the basis
             for the famous (?) 'Connection Machine', created at MIT.
             The book is actually Hillis' Phd thesis, but very readable.
 
 
        [b]  'Artifical Life'; [The Proceedings of An Interdisciplinary
              Workshop on The Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems.
              Held September 1987, in Los Alamos New Mexico.];
              Christopher G Langton ed; 'Vol VI Santa Fe Institute Studies
              in Sciences of Complexity'; Addison Wesley 1989,
              ISBN 0-201-09346-4.  ISBN 0-201-09356-1 (pbk).
 
              Not sure about this one.  Discusses all manner of biologically
              inspired methods for modelling 'living' systems.  Includes
              simulation, graphics, animal behaviour, artificial intelligence.
              Cuts across all kinds of subjects.  I suspect that the stuff on
              generating graphics for instance (eg modelling plant growth)
              may be of some interest to those who want 'plants' and 'animals'
              or whatever in their VR.  [Who wants VRs to have straight
              grid-lines or neon cubes all over the place ?  :-) ]
              The book is *huge*, and also has papers by Moravec, and Drexler
              (of nano-technology fame.)
