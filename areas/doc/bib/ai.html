expert system medical
%X Rojer Jones, planning manager in Metropolital Life's corporate
systems planning division, said that it is very difficult to
encode expert thinking and in many cases the bank prefers
training human experts to developing expert systems.  He said that
experts might lie, be wrong or the business might change.  He
emphasized that some experts are so possessive of their knowledge
that they would covertly sabotage the expert system development
process.  In the case of one project, it cost more to transcribe
the 30 pages of medical information to provide to the expert system
than to have an underwriter evaluate the information.  Insurance
companies are using larger pools of data to determine actuarial
tables so that expert systems based on segregated pools (e. g. with
men separated from women) would be obsolete.  He claims that
the systems that were successful (Prospector, Dendral) mapped a very broad
knowledge base of simple facts.

Beau Sheil of Xerox Artificial Intellgience Systems - AI works best

Xerox has received an order for 1000 of its 1185 work stations and is
flooded with requests at similar volume.
Alan Kay of Apple said "we need to do problem finding," not problem
solving.  He also griped about logic programming and parallel
processing.  He made a comment that if the Intel 80286 is a weak
architecture, what is it when you have 16 of them?  [probably a
veiled reference to Intel's Cosmic Cube.]
Larry Levesque of Carnegie Group said that AI products and
