To those who requested the qualia bibliography --
 
Hi.  Enclosed is the bibliography on qualia, consciousness, and first-person
issues in general in the philosophy of mind.  It's certainly very incomplete;
it basically consists of tracing references recursively, and the odd random
journal search.  Most listing are from the 1980's, there's an odd reference
from the 70's and before if it was important, or if I happened to have the
paper on hand.  This is still only a fraction of the literature from the 80's,
though.  Any pointers to things I've missed would be appreciated.  I'm
still slowly compiling this, but I thought I'd send it off now to those who
requested it rather than wait for a never-to-be-achieved perfection.
 
Criteria for inclusion was essentially that the papers bear on the big
first-person issues -- i.e. the "Mind-Body problem", consciousness, qualia
and so on.  Of course such issues form only a small minority of recent
literature in the philosophy of mind, most of which is concerned with such
third-person issues as propositional attitudes, mental content and folk
psychology.  Sometimes the third-person/first-person boundary is blurry, I've
tried to be reasonably strict.  I have another bibliography, about as big
but by implication far less complete, which deals with third-person issues,
if you're interested.
 
I've grouped the papers under what I hope are reasonably well-defined headings,
with salient names mentioned: including Subjectivity (Nagel); Knowledge
Argument (Jackson); Functionalism and Qualia (Shoemaker/Block); Qualia,
General; Programs and Consciousness (Searle); Machines and Consciousness,
General; Subjective Experience; Consciousness; and a few others.  There are
some annotations, giving a one-line summary -- ignore these if you like, they
may not be helpful for anyone but me, and have only been included occasionally,
anyway.  Any feedback is welcome.
