Graeme Hirst (gh@cs.rochester.edu) told me that
 
   There is some controversy (and bad feelings) about who actually
   invented the idea.  I think Jim Hendler thinks it was his.
   He's now at U Maryland, hendler@cs.umd.edu.
 
 
Jim Hendler (hendler@mimsy.umd.edu), one of the developers of the NLMenu
system at Texas Instruments, sent a message suggesting
 
   I contact Brian Phillips, another of the developers, but I have been
   unable to locate him. He apparently works for Tektronix.
 
 
Jim Tyhurst (jimt@context.mentor.com) mentions a paper that discusses some
of the problems associated with the NLMenu system:
 
  Tyhurst, James J., and Kerry L. Glover. 1988. A menu-based interface for
  expert system rules. In Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Expert Systems
  Conference and Exposition (April 12-14, 1988). Detroit: Engineering
  Society of Detroit.  pp. 203-210.
 
 
Thomas Grossi (grossi@capsogeti.fr) told me that
 
    he has developed a front end quite similar to Tennant's.
    The front end is part of Esprit-I project "Esteam" and produces
    Functional Descriptions for a dialogue module (Functional Descriptions
    are a frame-based linguistic representation used in unification
    grammars).

Thank you to all those who sent me messages.
I would welcome further information from people about menu-based NLU.
If I receive more replies, I will summarize to the net again.
