A week ago I asked about "constraint-based languages", and since then a
number of people have replied. My thanks to you all - your notes have
been a considerable help, and have led me to a lot of good work.
 
A summary follows...

    See the next to last (January edition I think) of AI Expert. They have
    at least one article on constraint languages in it. No doubt there will
    be many more to follow.

    Take a look at ICCP'87.  Prof. Baldwin and I have a paper there (p.
    389) on a parallel constraint-based language.  There is a more
    extensive TR (number 208, "The Design of the Consul Programming
    Language") you might like to order by sending a message to Ms. Peggy
    Meeker (meeker@cs.rochester.edu).
 
    For more details, the person to contact is certainly Prof. Doug
    Baldwin (baldwin@cs.rochester.edu), who is conducting research on
    general-purpose constraint languages.
 
    Good luck with your research!

    Last fall, I ran into a nice book entitled "Constraint Programming
    Languages, Their Specification and Generation" by Wm Leler which is
    published by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.  It "provides an
    introduction to the subject of constraint satisfaction, a survey of
    existing systems, and introduces a new technique that makes
    constraint-satisfaction systems significantly easier to create and
    expand" in a very readable fashion.
 
    The latter half of the book focuses on the author's general-purpose
    specification language called Bertrand that allows a user to describe a
    constraint-satisfaction system using rules.  The software described is
    available for a "nominal charge" from the author.

    Constraint Logic Programming is currently getting alot of attention
    at logic programming conferences.
 
    You might try:
 
    Jaffar, Joxan and Lassez, Jean-Louis, "Constraint Logic Programming", Proc
    of the 14th ACM Conference on Principles of Programming Languages, Munich,
    January 1987.
 
    Jaffar, Joxan and Michaylov, Spiro, "Methodology and Implementation of
    a CLP System", Proc of the 4th International Conference on Logic Programming
   ,
    Melbourne Australia, May 1987, pp 196-218, MIT Press.
 
    Heintze, N.C., Michaylov, S., and Stuckey, P.J., "CLP(R) and Some Electrical
    Engineering Problems", Proc of the 4th International Conference on
    Logic Programming, Melbourne Australia, May 1987, pp 675-703, MIT Press.
 
    (I suspect that a number of people will send you the same citations)
 
    Jaffar's work is very interesting since it provides a semantic
    framework (if that makes any sense) for a whole family of constraint
    based languages.
 
    The bibliographies will point you to other work into constraints and logic
    programming.
 
    I hope this helps.

    A book has been published recently called (I think) "cobstraint-
    based languages." The author is William Leler or Leder (sorry, I
    don't have it here at work with me so I can't give you a more
    accurate reference).

    Here is a reference to a book that I haven't had an opportunity to look
    into yet since it is still being processed as a new acquistion by our
    library:
 
      W. Leler (1988).
      Constraint programming languages -- their specification and generation.
      Addison-Wesley series in computer science.
      Reading (MA), [etc.].
 
    I would be interested in hearing about further references you have or may
    receive, and in particular in relation to UIMS.

I've also heard that at least some Prologs understand how to do arithmetic,
and that there's a commercial product called TK!Solver which does interesting
things. I haven't seen these myself yet.
 
Constraint languages seem to be very much still in their infancy. Lots of
room for some good work (hint hint!)  - I hope we'll be able to contribute
some too. Thanks again -
