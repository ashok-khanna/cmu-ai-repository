Greetings.

The following is a bibliography I began putting together for my
dissertation regarding the use of adaptive systems (NN, GA, GP) for
approaching interesting problems in molecular biology. Quite a few people
have asked me for this bib. so I thought I would post it here with a cross
posting in comp.ai.genetic.  I am a mechanical engineering graduate student
working with micro/molecular biologists on the problem of DNA sequencing
and have found that mol. bio. is an area rich with interesting problems
that could benefit from techniques available from the AI community.  There
is some poetic justice in using genetic programming to enhance genetic
engineering.  

What follows is an incomplete bibliography of papers that I have found
discussing adaptive systems and a few of the problems of interest to
biologists.  I have concentrated on NN and GP and ignored some very
interesting work using different grammars, immune nets, case-based
reasoning, expert systems, etc.  My interest is in DNA / protein sequencing
and this bib. may be a little heavy in that area.  If I have missed a
seminal paper or someone's work, I apologize.  This is just what I have put
together and found useful.  I have not attempted to standardize
bibliography style but tended to present them as I found them, please
forgive errors of style and spelling.  Please feel free to pass this around
and cross post as you like.

Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Biology; edited by Lawrence Hunter. 
AAAI Press (1993) ISBN 0-262-58115-9. --- An excellent book covering many
areas of AI which includes a chapter on Molecular Biology for Computer
Scientists (2nd in value only to the Cartoon Guide to Genetics!).  Some
papers in this reference are:

Searls, D.;  The Computational Linguistics of Biological Sequences.  pg.
47.

Interpretation of the NMR Spectra of Proteins.  pg. 396.

--- A final chapter by Joshua Lederberg  titled:  The Anti-Expert System -
Thirteen Hypothesis an AI Program Should Have Seen Through. --- is an
excellent discussion of how we know if our system is working correctly and
completely, something the AI community (myself included) ignores all too
frequently.
