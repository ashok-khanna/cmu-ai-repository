proposes to collaborate with Baecker, Buxton and Booth on using a DataGlove to manipulate entities in a knowledge base for software development. the user would, for example, do allocation operations by
grasping and moving of virtual objects.

Garb, Yaakov
"Virtual Reality"
Whole Earth Review, Winter 1987, p. 118-120
"[The] increasing ability to represent (and in some significant substitute) portions of our world with virtual reality of compact, easily manipulable visual symbols -- through texts, maps, tables, charts, and diagrams -- is a large part of what modernity is all part.  Places and things far away in space and time can be accumulated, presented synoptically to the eye, compared, reworked, amended, archived, re-presented, and distributed -- symbolically and at our discretion."

This idea becomes particularly powerful as the "Eye-of-God" concept of Daniel Mocsny.

"The first fully functional teldildonics system will be a communication device, not a fucking machine.
. . Twenty years from now, when portable teledidlers will be ubiquitous, most people will use them to have sexual experiences with other people at a distance, in combinations and configurations undreamed of by precybernetic voluptuaries."

Wilson, Craig, and "the Pixel cat"
Anticipatory meta-planning for cyberspace
Usenet, Nov. 1989
the Pixel cat, Nov 2 89 quotes Craig S. Wilson @com2serv.CS2.MN.ORG:
'the people we will be able to call the 'Pioneers' will be the ones who, although working to accomplish their companys' goals, also keep longer term goals in mind.  And they will have the stubs and openings for the implementation of the longer term goals when the time is right.'
See? If we start working on it right now, with  long-term goals in mind,  we can have all the design work done when we actually have hyperchips that use monomolecular swirches and fiberoptics.  Or whatever."
