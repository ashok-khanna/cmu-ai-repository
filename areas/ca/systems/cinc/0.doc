Description: 
 
   Cinc is an implementation of the Creatures processing model for the
   NeXT. Creatures attempts to retain many of the attractive features of
   cellular automata while allowing dynamic systems to be studied more
   easily. This is done by describing the active elements of a system,
   rather than the space in which they live.
