This is the readme file for the CDM interpreter. This program executes
programs written in a specialized language called SLANG. It is intended
for programming and executing asynchronous cellular automata.

It is being distributed
in the following files:

    cdm-exe.sit.hqx   Executable, some test code
    cdm-src.sit.hqx   Source Code

These are Stuffit 1.5.1 archives that have also been Binhex'ed.
If you are using FTP, they can be transferred as ascii files.
To unpack them you will need Stuffit 1.5.1 or later.

The program is not well documented within these archives; in fact,
there pretty much isn't any documentation in the archives. We're working
on it. We're also working on a better readme file.

To use the program, you're going to need to read one of the papers that
have been written about it. The papers were written by Prof. Hans
Sieburg at UC San Diego. [Apologies for not having bibliographic
references here... we're rushing out the distribution because people who
have already read the papers want the software. If you need pointers to
the papers, send one of us email. -- SK]

We should have more documentation available soon; in the meantime,
contact one of us if you want more information.
