This batch of files comprises probably most of the source code of PARRY,
the paranoid mental hospital patient created by Professor Ken Colby, et
al., in the early 1970s at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab of the
Stanford University Computer Science Department.

The code here compiles and runs using the MLISP language (meta-lisp) on the
WAITS operating system running on a DEC PDP-10.  Don't expect to be able to
run it yourself, because you probably don't have the original environment.
The code is definitely non-portable.  Parts of it are written in PDP-10
assembly code (e.g., *.fai and *.lap files).  Other parts are written in
MLISP (e.g., pmem* files).  There may be other parts that require other
language translators.

You'll have to poke around to figure out how the code is organized.  There
is no guarantee that parts of the Parry source are not missing from here.
