Description: 

   UMass GBB is a free blackboard system written in Common Lisp.  Work on
   the UMass GBB project (and funding) ended over 2 years ago.  Although
   the UMass research system remains available, it should not be confused
   with the commercial system. The commercial system is substantially
   improved and extended. Many researchers using it have opted for the
   commercial release, which is available from
