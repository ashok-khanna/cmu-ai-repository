This newsgroup is the place to start for Constraint Logic Programming,
and Concurrent Constraint Programming. See the FAQ for this group for
more information. A newsgroup called comp.ai.constraints ahs been
proposed: the proposer has agreed with some suggestions that the group
ought to be called comp.constraints.  (Does the newsgroup exist yet?)

comp.ai and sci.op-research are good newsgroups for the Constraint
Satisfaction Problem and linear/non-linear consrained modelling,
respectively.

There are three mailing lists that I am aware of for CLP:

clp-request@cis.ohio-state.edu
clp-request.All_Areas@xerox.com
ccl-request@dfki.uni-sb.de		(not quite clp)

The book which is always cited:

author = "Pascal {Van Hentenryck}",
title = "Constraint Satisfaction in Logic Programming",
year = 1989,
publisher = "MIT Press",
address = "Cambridge, MA",
isbn = "0-262-08181-4",


There are also some ftp sites:

location:	ftp.daimi.aau.dk	
directory:	pub/CLP
contents:	loads of different papers 

		archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
		pub/clp/{bib,papers}
		a bibtex bibliography for CLP, also some papers

		duck.dfki.uni-sb.de
		pub/ccl
		stuff on the EC ESPRIT project called CCL

		ftp.ecrc.de
		<different directories>
		technical reports etc from the ECRC

		parcftp.xerox.com
		<different directories>
		CCP stuff by Saraswat and others

		wilma.cs.brown.edu
		pub/ppcp93
		Proceedings of 'Principles and Practice of Constraint
		Programming 1993'
