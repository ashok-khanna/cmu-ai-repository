Summary:      Vision Newsgroup Archives

Description:

   This directory contains archives of many of the computer vision
   related newsgroups. The new articles in each newsgroup are archived
   once a week, in a gzipped tar file of the form YY_MM_DD.tgz, where
   YY, MM, and DD are replaced with the year, month, and day,
   respectively. Most newsgroups begin with 94_09_14.tgz, which
   includes articles since 23-JUL-94, but some may include articles
   before that.
