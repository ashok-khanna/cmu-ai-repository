OBVIUS (Object-Based Vision and Image Understanding System) is an
image-processing system based on Common Lisp and CLOS (Common Lisp
Object System).  The system provides a flexible interactive user
interface for working with images, image-sequences, and other
pictorially displayable objects.  By using Lisp as its primary
language, the system is able to take advantage of the interpretive
lisp environment (the ``listener''), object-oriented programming, and
the extensibility provided by incremental compilation.

The top-level of OBVIUS is implemented in Common Lisp, thus providing
an interpreted, object-oriented programming environment.  The
low-level floating point operations are implemented in C for
efficiency.  A graphical user interface, based on menus and dialog
boxes is also provided, in addition to the Lisp interpreter
(listener).  In the typical mode of interaction, the user types an
expression to the lisp listener (or enters a command in a dialog box)
and it returns a result.  A picture of that result will then be
automatically displayed in a window.  Each window contains a circular
stack of pictures.  The user can cycle through this stack using mouse
clicks with certain shift (``bucky'') key combinations.  Commonly used
operations such as histogram and zoom are also provided via mouse
clicks.

The system provides a library of low-level image processing
routines, including
   -  arithmetic operations (add, multiply, lookup-table point
      operations, etc) 
   -  image statistics (mean, variance, kurtosis, maximum,
      histograms etc) 
   -  convolutions, Fourier transforms, Hilbert transforms
   -  geometric operations (crop, slice, rotate, flip-x, etc)
   -  comparisons (greater-than, etc)
   -  synthetic image generation
   -  matrix operations
OBVIUS also provides postscript output of pictures.  Writing new 
operations in OBVIUS is relatively simple, and it is straightforward
to add new viewable and picture types.

OBVIUS uses a homebrew interface to X11 (i.e., it does not use
clx or clue). However, they eventually hope to port Obvius to a 
CLX/CLUE platform.

Version:      3.0.3 (30-MAY-94)

Requires:     Common Lisp, X11

Ports:        Runs in Lucid 4.0 on Sun and SGI workstations. For the
              Sun implementation, it also requires the LispView
              interface to OpenWindows/X, which is available free of
              charge on the X11 distribution tape (copy included in
              this distribution).
