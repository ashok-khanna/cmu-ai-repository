Obvius 3.0 is now ready for release, via anonymous ftp at
white.stanford.edu.  This new version runs on both SUN and SGI
workstations under Lucid 4.1.  For the SGI implementation, you need to
get a beta release of Lucid 4.1 from Lucid.  The SGI implementation
uses a lisp interface to gl (written by Patrick Teo,
teo@white.stanford.edu) that you may find useful for other
applications as well.  This new tarfile also includes a number of
tutorials on various topics in image processing and vision that we
have developed over the last year for teaching.

Sorry for the long delay.  We were expecting to get this done by the
end of March, but with teaching etc...
