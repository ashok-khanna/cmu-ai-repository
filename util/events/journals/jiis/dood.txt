		 ADVANCES IN DEDUCTIVE OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASES
		 -----------------------------------------------

			  A Special Issue of the
		   JOURNAL of INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS:
	    Integrating Artificial Intelligence & Database Technologies


The Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is planning a special issue on
deductive object-oriented databases (DOOD) to be published in the Fall of 94.
The main focus of the issue will be on the integration of the two programming
paradigms, declarative and object-oriented. However, papers dealing with each
of these paradigms separately are also welcome.

The topics include but are not limited to:

	- Data models for object-oriented databases (OODB)
	- Declarative languages for querying and manipulating OODB
	- Query optimization in DOOD
	- Database dynamics (logics for updates, actions)
	- Constraint management
	- Application of DOOD to knowledge representation,
	  scientific databases, visual programming, robotics, etc.


The special issue will consist of four or five original, high-quality
papers selected from the pool of submitted manuscripts.  There is a limit
of 25 pages per submission, including bibliography (each page having
maximum 44 lines of text with maximum 60 characters per line).


*************The deadline for submission is August 27, 1993**************


Submit four copies of the full paper to:

ABOUT THE JOURNAL:

JIIS is a new journal, launched in Summer 1992. Its mission is to
present research and development focused on the integration of
Artificial Intelligence and Database Management technologies to
provide models, architectures, tools and techniques for the next 
generation of systems--Intelligent Information Systems.  

JIIS is an archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing 
the following types of high-quality, state-of-the-art papers: 
*research papers *invited papers *workshop and conference reports 
*survey and tutorial articles *book reviews.  In addition to papers 
IIS also presents: *meeting announcements *reviews *open problems 
and proposed solutions.

     THE SCOPE OF THE JOURNAL INCLUDES:

* Formal Aspects (Petri Nets, hypergraphs, activity models, 
  object-oriented models).

* Methodologies for analysis, specification, design and implementation.

* Technological Support (multimedia, hypermedia, hypertext, 
  object-orientation).

* User Models and User Interfaces (user profiles, requirements,
  task analysis, usability testing and evaluation methods, direct
  manipulation and graphical user interfaces, screen design
  and knowledge visualization).

* Information/Knowledge/Data Representation and Integration (knowledge
  models, semantic models, reasoning and query processing techniques,
  data and knowledge interchange and interoperability).

* Domain Modeling and Information Engineering (domain analysis, 
  domain design, multiple view points of information systems, information
  engineering).

* Expert Database Systems (semantic and rule-based query processing, 
  constraint management/integrity/security, active databases, cooperative
  query processing).

* Logic and Databases (deductive databases, close world model, fixed point
  model, nonmonotonic reasoning, symbolic reasoning).

* Information Storage and retrieval (full text search, automatic indexing,
  lexicology, intelligent dictionaries/directories).

* Machine Learning and Discovery (knowledge discovery in databases, genetic
  algorithms, concept learning, system adaptation and evolution).

* Reasoning under Uncertainty (noisy, incomplete, vague, uncertain, and
  contradictory data/knowledge).

* Distributed Information Systems (interoperability and cooperation in
  heterogeneous systems, intelligent agents).

* Cooperative and Collaborative Environments
