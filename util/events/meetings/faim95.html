ANNOUNCEMENT & CALL FOR PAPERS

5th International Conference FAIM '95
Flexible Automation & Intelligent Manufacturing

June 28-30, 1995
Stuttgart Germany

CONFERENCE OBJECTIVES

Emerging technologies are revealing unprecedented opportunities
for bringing new and improved products into being which will
command a more competitive position in the marketplace. These
technologies are acting to expand realizable design and manufacturing
optlons.

Issues related to product and process design, process monitoring,
information management, and flexible manufacturingsystems (FMS)
must be addressed to secure a strong international competitive
position. Manufacturing success depends on the quality of the product
being produced for the competitive market. These quality products
can only be produced at the right cost if timely product data to and
from the shop floor are available for decision making. To achieve
effective flexible automation, industry must develop a realistic system/
network approach including human knowledge and experiences,
computer potential to support manufacturing and office work
(Computer integrated manufacturing / business (CIM,CIB)).

Major initiatives at national and international levels have taken
place during the last decade to introduce the concept of information
integration from the enterprise level, through design, and to the
process (individual device) level. In order to stay competitive, the
world market demand requires a new generation of manufacturing
systems: Intelligent Manufacturing. This conference provides a forum
to address problems currently being encountered by industry, R&D
institutions and major international universities for developing
systems based on synergetic combination of technology, people and
organisations.

CONFERENCE THEMES

The conference will include keynote, invited. and contributed
papers in research and applications in the following areas:

CALL FOR PAPERS

Papers are invited on the topics listed and others within the
general theme of the conference. Abstracts of no more than 500
words should be submiffed to the conference secretary by September
9, 1994. Abstracts should clearly state the purpose, results, and
conclusions of the work to be described in the final paper. Authors of
accepted abstracts will be notified by October 7, 1994. The category
designation from the list of topics and final acceptance will be based
upon review of the full length paper, which must be received by
December 19, 1994.

All papers will be refereed, and at least one author must be a paid
registrant by March 20, 1995 in order to have the paper appear in the
bound proceedings. The proceedings will be published in book form
for distribution to conference attendees.

The language of the conference will be English.
