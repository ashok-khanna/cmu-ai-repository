			   CALL FOR PAPERS

                             SOUTHCON 94

                           March 29-31, 1994
                            Orlando, Florida


Southcon is a technical conference and exhibition, sponsored by IEEE covering 
a wide breadth of electronics technology and applications. The goal of the 
technical conference is to provide attendees with new, state-of-the art 
information, as well as identify future trends in the electronics industry 
which can be immediately applied to their engineering decisions. The technical 
sessions emphasize current or near-term applications, advances and trends which
engineers should consider for present practice in product design and
manufacture. In addition to the technical sessions and exhibitions the
conference will also consist of a number of plenary sessions and tutorial
conducted by well known experts in the field. Southcon is usually attended 
by 800-900 people, most of which are scientists from the academia and industry 
primarily located in the IEEE Region 3 area.

One of the areas of interest to Southcon is NEURAL NETWORKS THEORY, 
NEURAL NETWORKS APPLICATIONS and NEURAL NETWORKS IMPLEMENTATIONS.
If you are interested in submitting a paper to Southcon related with
one of the aforementioned topics, please send a 250 word abstract to the
following address by OCTOBER 18, 1993:

Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
University of Central Florida
Orlando, FL 32816

To expedite matters you may want to submit your abstract by FAX
[(407) 823-5835], or via e-mail [mng@engr.ucf.edu]. The deadline
for FAX or e-mail submissions is also OCTOBER 18, 1993

Your abstract should include a cover page with the following information

1. Title of the Paper.

2. Topic of Interest (e.g., Neural Network Theory, Neural Network 
Applications, Neural Network Implementation).

3. Author's (Authors') Name (Names), Affiliation and Complete Address.

4. Principal Author's phone number, FAX number (optional), 
and e-mail address (optional).

Final acceptance of papers will be announced by the Program Committee
some time in late November. Detailed instructions for manuscript preparation
will be sent to all the participants at that time. The final manuscripts of 
all the accepted papers are due by JANUARY 14, 1994. Registration for
the conference is FREE for all paper presenters.

If you need more information about the conference please contact
Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos at (407) 823-5338 or Dr. Issa Batarseh at
(407) 823-0185.
