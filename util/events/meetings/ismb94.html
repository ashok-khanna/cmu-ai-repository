The Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular 
Biology will take place at Stanford University in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, August 14-17, 1994.  The ISMB conference, held for the first time 
last summer in Bethesda, MD, attracted an overflow crowd, yielded an 
excellent offering of papers, invited speakers, posters and tutorials, 
provided an exciting opportunity for researchers to meet and exchange 
ideas, and was an important forum for the developing field.  We will 
continue the tradition of pre-published, rigorously refereed proceedings, 
and opportunities for fruitful personal interchange.

The conference will bring together scientists who are applying the 
technologies of advanced data modeling, artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, probabilistic reasoning, massively parallel computing, robotics, 
and related computational methods to problems in molecular biology.  We 
invite participation from both developers and users of any novel system, 
provided it supports a biological task that is cognitively challenging, 
involves a synthesis of information from multiple sources at multiple 
levels, or in some other way exhibits the abstraction and emergent 
properties of an "intelligent system."  The four-day conference will 
feature introductory tutorials (August 14), presentations of original 
refereed papers and invited talks (August 15-17).

Paper submissions should be single-spaced, 12 point type, 12 pages 
maximum including title, abstract, figures, tables, and bibliography with 
titles.  The first page should include the full postal address, electronic 
mailing address, telephone and FAX number of each author.  Also, please 
list five to ten keywords describing the methods and concepts discussed 
in the paper.  State whether you wish the paper to be considered for oral 
presentation only, poster presentation only or for either presentation 
format.  Submit 6 copies to the address below.  For more information, 
please contact ismb@camis.stanford.edu.

Proposals for introductory tutorials must be well documented, including 
the purpose and intended audience of the tutorial as well as previous 
experience of the author in presenting such material.  Those considering 
submitting tutorial proposals are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page 
outline, before the deadline, to enable early feed-back regarding topic 
and content suitability.  The conference will pay an honorarium and 
support, in part, the travel expenses of tutorial speakers.

Limited funds are available to support travel to ISMB-94 for those students, 
post-docs, minorities and women who would otherwise be unable to attend..

PURPOSE

The Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology (ISMB) will take place at Stanford University, Palo Alto,
California on August 14-17, 1994. The ISMB conference is intended to bring
together scientists who are applying the technologies of advanced data
modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, parallel
computing, and other computational methods to problems in molecular
biology. The scope extends to any computational or robotic system
supporting a biological task that is cognitively challenging, involves a
synthesis of information from multiple sources at multiple levels, or in
some other way exhibits the abstraction and emergent properties of an
"intelligent system." 

Last year's conference in Bethesda, MD attracted an overflow crowd, yielded
a diverse offering of papers, invited speakers, posters and tutorials,
provided an exciting opportunity for researchers to meet and exchange
ideas, and was an important forum for the developing field. We are
continuing the tradition of pre-published, rigorously refereed proceedings,
and opportunities for fruitful personal interchange. 

The four-day conference will feature introductory and advanced
tutorials (on August 14), and presentations of original refereed papers
and invited talks (on August 15-17).  A preliminary program including 
original papers will be distributed in early May.  Tutorials are 
described below.

The conference will be held at:

Fairchild Auditorium
Stanford University Medical Center
Stanford, California

Stanford is in the San Francisco Bay area, approximately 25 minutes south
of San Francisco International Airport and approximately 25 minutes north
of San Jose International Airport. 

Limited funds are available to support travel to ISMB-94 for students and
post-docs, as well as for women and minority scientists.  Applications are
available by contacting ismb@camis.stanford.edu or using the mailing
address given below.

AM Tutorials (August 14, 1994, 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)

Introductory AM Tutorials:

         T1. INFORMATION SCIENCE FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGISTS.              
                Dr. Douglas Brutlag (Stanford University)
                will provide an introduction to and overview of
                the methods of information science particularly
                relevant to molecular biology. These include
                multiple representations, machine learning, search
                and constraint methods, sequence analysis techniques,
                and pattern matching, with specific examples.

         T2. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY FOR COMPUTER SCIENTISTS.
                Dr. Gary Stormo (University of Colorado, Boulder)
                will provide an introduction to and overview of
                the basic concepts of modern molecular biology
                particularly relevant to computational methods.
                These include the fundamentals of DNA, RNA and
                protein sequences, their structures and functions,
                concepts of homology and phylogenetic relationships,
                and basic cell biology and metabolism. In addition,
                information will be provided about experimental methods,   
                databases, and the genome project.

     Advanced AM Tutorials:

         T3. MINIMAL LENGTH ENCODING IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY.                 
             
                Dr. Aleksandar Milosavljevic (Argonne National
                Laboratory) will introduce the minimal length
                encoding (MLE) method to computational biologists
                who are designing sequence analysis algorithms, to
                computer scientists who are in interested in learning
                more about macromolecular sequence analysis, and to
                biologists who are more advanced users of sequence
                analysis programs. The emphasis will be on the use of
                the MLE method as a tool for comparative analysis.


         T4. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES IN COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR             
                BIOLOGY. Dr. Pierre Baldi (California Institute of         
                Technology) will provide an introduction to the basic
                machine learning methods often used in sequence analysis:
                including hidden markov models,  neural networks,
                the Bayesian framework and maximum likelihood estimation, 
                model fitting and model classes, learning and optimization 
                algorithms, and applications.  (This tutorial is the first
                of a two-part sequence with T9.  The cost for T4
                and T9 is $70.)

PM Tutorials (August 14, 1994, 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM)

    Introductory PM Tutorials:

        T5.  COMPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN        
                MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. Drs. Russ Altman (Stanford University)
                and Peter Karp (SRI) will provide a breadth first survey
                of important application areas within ISMB, and discuss
                outstanding accomplishments and challenges. Topics will    
                include biological databases, sequence analysis, protein  
                and nucleic acid structure prediction, signal to symbol    
                transformations, molecular evolution, metabolic pathways,  
                and machine learning. (T1 or T2 or equivalent recommended)

        T6.  NEURAL NETWORKS
                Dr. David Bisant (Stanford University)
                will teach the basics of neural network models.
                The session will also highlight the application
                of neural networks to sequence analysis and other
                problems in molecular biology. The tutorial will start
                with the most basic concepts and proceed from there.

    Advanced PM Tutorials:

        T7.  CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY.              
                Drs. Christopher Rawlings and Dominic Clark
                (Imperial Cancer Research Fund) will show how
                a wide variety of biological problems, especially those
                with very large hypothesis spaces, can be formulated
                as constraint satisfaction problems. They will discuss
                solution methods for constraint satisfaction
                problems using ideas (such as search, optimization and
                network consistency) from classical artificial
                intelligence as well as more recent developments
                from related disciplines.

        T8. GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND GENETIC PROGRAMMING.                    
            
                Dr. John Koza (Stanford University)
                will introduce the genetic algorithm, an
                increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear
                multidimensional optimization problems, that was
                originally inspired by a biological metaphor. This
                tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and
                the actual implementation and characteristics of the
                algorithm. Genetic programming (an extension for
                problems in which the size and shape of the solution
                is a major part of the problem) will also be addressed.

        T9. HOW TO USE HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS, STOCHASTIC                    
                CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMARS AND OTHER RELATED MODELS
                Dr. David Haussler (U.C. Santa Cruz)
                will provide a solid foundation in the use of hidden
                Markov and related statistical models, including theory
                and key algorithms, the time series model, stochastic
                graph grammars, segment models, practical issues and
                limitations, and detailed examples of biological   
                applications.  (This tutorial is the second of a two-part 
                sequence with T4.  The cost for T4 and T9 is $70.)

HOUSING AND MEAL PLANS

Accommodations are available for the conference at the Governor's Corner
student housing facility on Stanford's Campus (corner of Santa Teresa St.
and Campus Drive West). The housing facility and dining room are a 10 to 15
minute walk from the main conference venue, Fairchild Auditorium. A special
combined room and board rate has been negotiated with the conference
