Overview
--------

The Machine Learning (ML) in Design workshop is part of the Artificial 
Intelligence in Design '94 conference.   This workshop is intended 
to provide a forum for provocative discussion related to the 
application and evolution of machine learning techniques in design.   

To improve a product's quality or reduce the design cycle time 
designers require the right information, at the right time.   
Developments in computing technology present designers with ever 
increasing amounts of information and improved access.  Therefore, 
the effective and efficient re-use of past design procedures and 
product knowledge is becoming more critical in contemporary design.     

Designers not only use information of specific experiences but also, 
by learning and understanding salient issues, they can abstract or 
generalise knowledge from those experiences.  For example, they learn 
how to carry out design, what key decisions need to be made and when, 
what factors are crucial to decisions and what are the implications 
of those decisions, about the product itself, it's life expectancy 
and environment, it's manufacturability, the current state of 
technology, trends in the market place, and a lot more besides.  
Designers use their learned knowledge to create new designs (which 
may be novel or innovative) in an attempt to produce not only feasible 
but competitive products.  Consequently, there is a growing realisation 
that for future computer-based design systems to be more effective they 
must continually evolve their state of knowledge to reflect new 
experiences and that they must use that knowledge in all aspects of 
design problem solving.

By supporting the learning process it can be argued that computer based 
systems can become more effective tools which are better equipped to 
aid designers make well-informed decisions.  Machine Learning, whose 
utility has been explored typically in chemistry, game-playing, image 
recognition, and many other fields, provides a basis to capitalise on 
the utility of inherent and explicit past design knowledge.   However 
the application of machine learning in design is relatively immature 
and as such presents exciting and challenging issues to Machine 
Learning and Intelligent CAD researchers alike.

=======================================================================

Purpose of the workshop
-----------------------

The purpose of the workshop is to explore the issues and requirements 
of learning in design with a view of critically evaluating the current 
and required support from machine learning techniques.  The objective 
is not only to identify key areas for future research but also to 
stimulate synergy in the Machine Learning in Design research community.

=======================================================================

Workshop Format and Topics
--------------------------

The workshop will run for half a day prior to the main AI in Design 
conference.  Its format will depend upon submitted position papers but 
is likely to consist of a number of small working groups tackling 
identified issues and presenting their deliberations to the workshop 
participants for discussion.  Topics may address issues such as:   How 
can machine learning techniques be adapted or extended to support learning 
in design?  What are the limitations of ML in Design ?  Why does design 
present distinct challenges to ML research ? etc.

=======================================================================

Guidelines for Position Papers
-----------------------------

Position papers (in ascii or postscript form) of around three to four 
pages should be submitted by email to alex@cad.strath.ac.uk (Alex Duffy) 
no later than the 2nd June 1994.

All accepted position papers will be distributed to the participants.  

=======================================================================

Number of Participants
----------------------

To stimulate lively debate and constructive discussions numbers will 
be restricted to around 20-30 participants.  Admission, as determined 
by a selected panel, will be based upon the expediency of the submitted 
position papers and limited to attendees of the AI in Design conference.

 WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC BASIS FOR SHARING OF KNOWLEDGE AND DATA IN DESIGN
                ****************************************
                       to be held prior to the 
  THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN DESIGN

                          15-18 August 1994
=======================================================================

Summary
--------

Design processes in general involve multiple participants from several
disciplines and with different goals. As a consequence, a large number
of different views on the required design product can be
distinguished. Apart from syntactical differences due to the
particular representational schemes employed for describing the design
product, each of these views will bring along its own interpretation
of the design object at hand.
   The problem of combining different representations, in terms of
syntax and computational semantics, has already been extensively
investigated in the domain of software engineering. Typical examples
of established software engineering techniques for this purpose are
parsing, filtering, and compiling. Less emphasis has been put on
coping with different meanings or possible interpretations of the
information (data and knowledge) represented. This distinction can be
summarised as that between the computational aspects of information
and the description of the concepts that this information refers to,
respectively.
   Within AI, there seems to be a growing awareness of the importance of
dealing with differences in the conceptual bases underlying the
representation of information. For instance, several research groups
are currently working on the development of so-called sharable
ontologies: taxonomies of concepts, the `meaning' of which the users
of the information have agreed upon. Most people seem to agree that
communication about a problem requires some form of understanding of
each others conceptualisation of that problem. However, there seems to
be less agreement concerning the means for establishing this
understanding.
=======================================================================

Goals and Scope of the Workshop
-------------------------------

In the workshop, we would like to inventory existing ontologies and
conceptual models for design in the context of sharability. Typical
questions would be: what are important sources for a shared conceptual
basis (e.g. design standards, social conventions, and legacy systems),
and: how do we guarantee that conceptualisations can be shared between
different design agents. The goal of the workshop is to improve the
semantic basis required for the development of software systems that
allow for communication and sharing among engineering knowledge and
data bases used by different members of a design team. Expected
outcomes include an inventory of existing approaches to and
recommendations for obtaining such a semantic basis.
=======================================================================

Workshop Format 
---------------

The workshop will run over half a day prior to the main AI in Design
conference. Accepted papers will be distributed prior to the workshop
with a set of discussion topics. A selection will be made among the
accepted papers, the authors of which will be asked to present a
(very) concise summary of their views, concentrating on the discussion
topics. These presentations are intended as ``stepping stones'' for
extensive discussion, rather than at given a detailed account of the
specific approach taken.
=======================================================================

Guidelines for Submissions
--------------------------

Research-summary or position papers (in ascii or postscript, 8
pages max.) should be submitted by email to Mert Alberts,
alberts@cs.utwente.nl, no later than the 2nd June 1994. Submitted
papers must clearly state the suggested approach to the problem of
interfacing different conceptual models of a design product, and focus
around one of the following topics:

- conceptual models of design
- ontologies for design knowledge
- combining different ontologies
- multiple views on design products
- sharable representations of design objects and design knowledge
=======================================================================

Number of Participants
----------------------

There will be 20-25 participants.  Admission, as determined 
by a selected panel, will be based upon the expediency of the submitted 
position papers and limited to attendees of the AI in Design conference.  

Each participant will be charged a fee of SFr 75 to cover costs of 
workshop notes, administration and refreshments.

                             14:00--18:00 hs

                        Lausanne, Switzerland             

                   Held in conjunction with  AID'94
               (Artificial Intelligence in Design '94)
  

Description of Workshop
-----------------------

   'Shape' -- models of geometry -- plays an important role in the
development of design ideas. This workshop will provide a forum 
for researchers in artificial intelligence in design to discuss
reasoning with shape in design and the representations and
computations that support such reasoning.

The workshop organisers especially invite attention to the following
issues:

 * designers' understanding of shape information
 * the role of shape information in different models of design
      (examples of design models include search, constraints,
       prototypes, optimisation, and genetic processes)
 * models of shapes
 * representations of shapes
      (emerging representational schemes such as connectionist and 
       diagrammatic representations as well as traditional symbolic 
       representations, including mathematical ones, are of interest)
 * reasoning with shapes
 * transformations between alternative representations of shapes
 * computing with shapes
 * design applications involving shape

Format of the Workshop
----------------------

    The workshop will have a round-table format. Up to four 
20-minute presentations based on extended abstracts submitted by
participants will be given. Its duration will be 4 hours with 
a half hour break at the midpoint.  The presentations are intended to
act as catalysts for discussion which can and should go beyond 
the presentations themselves.

Attendance
----------

Attendance at the workshop will be restricted to persons whose
extended abstracts are accepted by the advisory
committee. To help ensure a focussed and collegial atmosphere, the 
number of attendees will be limited to 20-30 people.
Participants must register for both the workshop and the
general conference. The workshop fee will be SFr 75. This is to 
cover administration,  workshop notes and coffee break.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should be
directed to either of the coordinators.


Submissions Requirements
------------------------

Submit an extended abstract of 2-5 pages. Authors whose abstracts are
selected by the advisory committee for presentation will be requested
to prepare 20-minute presentations of their work.

Send submissions in plain ascii or Latex source format to

Workshop Call:
*************

The Nature and Role of Theories of Design in AI in Design Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workshop to be held as part of the Third International Conference on
Artificial Intelligence in Design Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,
Lausanne, Switzerland 15-18 August 1994


Background and Motivation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The work reported in the AI in Design literature has so far shown little
concern for the nature, development, or role of theories of design in AI in
Design research.  A notable exception to this is a paper by John Dixon,
[Dixon 1987], in which he presents the view that theories of design should
look like theories in the physical sciences.  An implication of such a view
is, that theories of design should be `hard' and testable, like those of
physics, chemistry, etc.  A further implication is that such theories can be
used to make precise predictions that can be tested by a single well
designed and executed experiment--as Newton's laws of motion can be, for
example.  Though Dixon presents clear arguments for his position, there
seems to be little evidence (yet, at least) that we are seeing the
development of this kind of theory of design in AI in Design research, nor
is there any reporting of the outcome of decisive experiments that attempt
to test any theories of design of this kind.

A different view on the nature of design theory in AI in Design research is
taken by those people who class the design process as a behavioural
phenomenon, not as a physical one.  In so doing, they advocate that theories
of design should look more like those of the behavioural sciences.  These
are typically `soft' theories which do not support precise value
predictions, but rather, attempt to identify the essential components of
behavioural phenomena, the relationships between them, and important
qualitative general properties.  The development and testing of these kinds
of theories typically involves large numbers of experiments in which
statistical variation and uncontrolled variables have a significant effect,
thus making the interpretation of the results from one experiment difficult
and potentially hazardous.  However, while the AI in Design literature does
contain some reporting of behaviour studies of human designers, it does not
report on any work that can be understood as forming part of an on going
attempt to develop and test this kind of theory of design.

Why then is there apparently so little concern for the nature, development,
and role of theories of design in the work reported in AI in Design?  Is it
because the field has no strong need for theories of design?  Is it because
what theory it does need it gets from elsewhere?  Or, is it still too early
to expect it to be able to effectively support this kind of work?  The
answer to all these questions would seem to be no, which leaves the issue of
the nature and role of theories of design in AI in Design research in need
of some urgent consideration and discussion.

Aims and Objectives of the Workshop:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main aims of this workshop are to survey and review the current status
of theories of design in AI in Design research and work devoted specifically
to experimental testing of design theories.  The objective is to try to
bring together what work there is on this subject and to establish a basis
for further fruitful interaction and discussion of the issues involved by
the people involved.


Format:
~~~~~~

The workshop will be organised around a number of short presentations and
discussions of contributions selected from those submitted.  With the
selection being based on an attempt to have all the major issues and aspects
raised in the contributions represented.


Guidelines for Submissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People wishing to attend the workshop should submit a clear and concise
position paper (up to five pages) which: describes work aimed at developing
a theory of design in the context of AI in Design; or constructively
comments on some existing and published theoretical developments; or
describes work aimed at experimentally testing any theory of design or some
significant part or aspect of one (not necessarily from AI in Design); or
presents an argument for what kind of theory (or theories) of design is
(are) needed in AI in Design, and why; or presents an argument for why no
theoretical work is required in AI in Design, and why; or any other kind of
contribution which the author(s) feel makes a constructive contribution to
the subject of the workshop.

Submitted contributions will be reviewed by the organising committe and
selected on the basis of clarity, conciseness, and relevance.  They should
be sent as ascii of Latex source by email to:
