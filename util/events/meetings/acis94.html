Call for Papers

ACIS'94

5th Australian Conference on Information Systems

Department of Information Systems
Monash University

September 27-29, Melbourne, Australia

The annual ACIS conference is the meeting point for Australian
information systems researchers.  Its purposes are to facilitate
communications between information systems researchers in Australia and
in other countries;  to provide an avenue whereby researchers can report
to their peers;  to provide exemplars of research and the reporting of
research;  and to assist people embarking on academic careers to commence
establishing a track record in research publication.

The Conference Programme will include plenary sessions featuring invited
speakers and panel sessions.  A significant proportion of the programme
is, however, reserved for the presentation of contributed papers.  It is
ACIS policy that papers will be considered on their merits, irrespective
of topic, perspective, theoretical stance or research design.

Information Systems researchers are invited to register immediately with
the Programme Committee their intention to contribute a paper to the
conference, and to request a copy of the Instructions for Authors.

All papers will be submitted to a blind refereeing process.  Advice will
be given to both successful and unsuccessful authors.  Accepted papers
will be published in the Conference Proceedings.
