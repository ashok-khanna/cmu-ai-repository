             1. General Conference Information
         ******************************************

The 1994  IEEE World  Congress on Computational Intelligence
consists of three IEEE International Conferences:  The Third
IEEE  International   Conference  on   Fuzzy  Systems,  IEEE
International Conference  on Neural  Networks, and  The IEEE
Conference on  Evolutionary Computation.  Over 1600 refereed
and invited papers will be presented in these Conferences as
well  as   to  a   special  five   day  Symposium   entitled
"Computational  Intelligence:   Imitating   Life."      This
Symposium will  be held Monday, June 27 through Friday, July
1, 10:20AM  to 12:20PM.  The Congress Inaugural will be held
Tuesday, June 28, 6:30PM to 7:15PM.



                  Special Plenary Symposium
         COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  IMITATING LIFE
                   June 27 - July 1, 1994

For the  first time  in one meeting, the main threads of the
topics in computational intelligence are woven into a single
cohesive fabric.    The  Symposium  addresses  the  exciting
emerging technologies  and issues  relating to biologically,
psychologically and  linguistically  motivated  models  that
exhibit  various   facets  of   computational  intelligence.
Machine  learning   from   data,   neuro-fuzzy   information
processing, approximate reasoning, vision/qualitory modeling
and evolutionary  computation, are examples of computational
intelligence approaches  addressed  by  Symposium  speakers.
The  Symposium   provides  a   unique   forum   for   cross-
fertilization between  the areas  of neural  networks, fuzzy
logic, and evolutionary computation.

The Symposium  consists of three public lectures, 10 plenary
talks and  30 mini-symposia  presentations; covering  neural
networks  (21),   fuzzy   logic   (13),   and   evolutionary
computation (9).   Contributions  include research  that has
implications for  further progress  in the  field, state-of-
the-art  reviews,   followed  by  discussions  of  important
applications in  fields such  as robotics and control, image
processing, vision,  and biology.  The presentations will be
highly focused but still tutorial.

Symposium   speakers    represent   the   top   internationl
researchers and practioners of this cutting edge technology.
"Computational  Intelligence:   Imitating  Life"   companion
volume to  this Symposium  will  be  complimentary  to  each
registered participant of the Congress.

         ******************************************

#1 Evolution Strategies:  A Thorough Introduction

  Professor Thomas Beack
  Computer Science Department, LS XI
  University of Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany
  
     In addition  to  Genetic  Algorithms  and  Evolutionary
  Programming, the  Evolution Strategy (Evolutionsstrategie)
  by  Rechenberg   and    Schwefel  forms  the  third  major
  representative of  Evolutionary  Algorithms.    Since  its
  development in  the 1960's  at the Technical University of
  Berlin (Germany)  for  solving  experimental  optimization
  problems, the  computer algorithm  has  been  successfully
  applied to numerous hard continuous parameter optimization
  problems (an  application field where Evolution Strategies
  reveal their  strengths in comparison to the more familiar
  Genetic Algorithms).
     The  tutorial   presents  a  thorough  introduction  to
  Evolution  Strategies,   with  special   emphasis  on  the
  following  topics:   history  of   evolution   strategies,
  detailed presentation  and explanation  of the  algorithm,
  genetic operators and parameter settings,  self-adaptation
  of strategy  parameters, theory  of evolution  strategies,
  selected application  examples  of  evolution  strategies,
  evolution strategies  for neural networks and fuzzy logic,
  guidelines for  practitioners, and  comparison to  genetic
  algorithms and evolutionary programming.


#2     Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications

  Dr. Lawrence "David" Davis Tica Associates
  Cambridge, MA
  
     Genetic algorithms  are techniques for optimization and
  machine learning that have been applied to a wide range of
  real-world  problems.     This  tutorial  consists  of  an
  overview of genetic algorithms, a discussion of techniques
  for applying  them, a  survey of  areas in which they have
  been applied,  and  several    application  case  studies.
  Particularly stressed  in the tutorial will be traditional
  and  nontraditional   genetic  algorithms   for  numerical
  function optimization;  the  use  of  order-based  genetic
  algorithms for  combinatorial optimization; and techniques
  for hybridizing genetic algorithms with other optimization
  algorithms.



#3    An Introduction to Evolutionary Computation

  Dr. David B. Fogel
  Natural Selection, Inc.
  La Jolla, CA

  The impact  of evolutionary  thinking on biology cannot be
  underestimated.   Indeed, many  biologists  have  remarked
  that the  study of  life cannot be conducted reasonably in
  the absence of an evolutionary paradigm.  But evolutionary
  thought extends  beyond an  ordering principle of biology.
  Evolution is a process that can be simulated on a computer
  and used  for solving  difficult engineering  problems and
  gaining  insight  into  natural  evolved  systems.    This
  tutorial, aimed  at researchers  in  neural  networks  and
  fuzzy systems,  and beginners in the field of evolutionary
  computation,  will   introduce  methods   of  evolutionary
  computation. These  include genetic  algorithms, evolution
  strategies  and   evolutionary  programming,  as  well  as
  related  techniques.     The   fundamental   philosophical
  foundations  of   the  methods   will  be   discussed  and
  applications  will  be  described,  including  synergistic
  efforts  of   combining  evolutionary   optimization  with
  connectionist and fuzzy systems.



#4              Genetic Programming

  Dr. John R. Koza
  Consulting Professor
  Computer Science Department,
  Stanford University, Palo Alto CA
     Genetic programming  extends the  genetic algorithm  to
  the domain  of computer  programs and  genetically  breeds
  populations  of   computer  programs  to  solve  problems.
  Genetic  programming   can  solve   problems   of   system
  identification,  optimal   control,  pattern  recognition,
  equation  solving,   game   playing,   optimization,   and
  planning.  Starting with hundreds or thousands of randomly
  created programs, the population is progressively improved
  by applying  Darwinian fitness  proportionate reproduction
  and crossover (sexual recombination).
     Many   problem    environments    have    regularities,
  symmetries, and  homogeneities that  can be  exploited  in
  solving the  problem.   The recently developed facility of
  automatic function  definition enables genetic programming
  to  dynamically   decompose  a   problem  into     simpler
  subproblems, solve  the subproblems, and assemble original
  problem.   Experimental evidence  suggests that  automatic
  function definition  reduces the computation effort needed
  to solve  a  problem  and  produces  a  simpler  and  more
  understandable overall solution.



#5  Genetics-Based Machine Learning in Rule-Based  and
    Neural Systems

  Professor Robert E. Smith
  Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics
  The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL

  This tutorial covers the application of genetic algorithms
  (GAs) in machine learning.  Machine learning is introduced
  in  the   framework  of   control,  with  an  emphasis  on
  reinforcement  learning,   where  the  system  must  learn
  through a  exploration.   A brief  overview of GAs is also
  provided.   Given this  background, the tutorial discusses
  rule-based, neural, and fuzzy techniques that utilize GAs.
  A rule-based  technique, the  learning  classifier  system
  (LCS), is  shown to be analogous to a neural network.  The
  integration of fuzzy logic into the LCS is also discussed.
  Research  issues   related  to   GA-based   learning   are
  overviewed.   The application potential for genetics-based
  machine learning is discussed.



#6    Genetic Algorithms:
      Theoretical Foundations and Experimental Evaluation

  Professor Darrell Whitley
  Computer Science Department
  Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO
  
  The principle of hyperplane sampling will be examined,  as
  well as  exact theoretical  models of  a canonical genetic
  algorithm.   Other topics  include:   deception, remapping
  hyperspace, stochastic  hill  climbing  versus  hyperplane
  sampling and  the case  against gray      coding  for test
  functions.   Holland's schema theorem and the K-arm bandit
  analogy will be reviewed and critiqued.  Alternative forms
  of the  genetic algorithm  such as Genitor, CHC, Evolution
  Strategies  and   parallel  genetic   algorithms  will  be
  reviewed.   The practical  implications  of  the  existing
  theory will  be explored  with respect to implementing and
  applying genetic algorithms to complex problems.  Examples
  are given  where simple  theoretical  insights  result  in
  improved search on problems of more than 500 variables.



#7              An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic

  Professor James Bezdek
  Department of Computer Science
  University of West Florida, Pensacola, FL

  This tutorial  begins by  developing the  basis for  fuzzy
  models.  The  first  hour  starts  with  a  discussion  of
  uncertainty  in  models  and  its  importance  for  system
  design. Membership  functions and fuzzy set operations are
  defined. We  pose and  answer some  basic questions  about
  fuzzy models - e.g., where do they come from? how are they
  evaluated? how  do they  compare with  probability models?
  The second  hour presents two applications vignettes.  The
  first  considers  stabilization  of  the  simple  inverted
  pendulum.  We compare the  classical (linear feedback) and
  fuzzy control  approaches, and  discuss design issues such
  as tuning  and stability.   The second application area is
  segmentation of  image data.   Several approaches based on
  fuzzy and neural models are presented and compared.



#8          Fuzzy Sets in Constraint Satisfaction

  Dr. Didier Dubois
  Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse
  Universite Paul Sabatier,  Toulouse Cedex - France

  Constraint-directed search  is a very general and powerful
  methodology for  problem solving,  which  is  particularly
  adapted to  finite domains  involving  high  combinatorial
  complexity.   The aim  of this  tutorial is  to show  that
  fuzzy set theory and constraint satisfaction can be easily
  and usefully put together.  The tutorial will describe the
  approach pioneered  by Bellman  and Zadeh for the modeling
  of fuzzy constraints, and point out the difference between
  a fuzzy     constraint and an objective function,  address
  how to  imbed flexible  constraint satisfaction in Zadeh's
  calculus of  fuzzy relations,  whose aim  is to  propagate
  preference in  constraint networks,  and review  in detail
  the applications  of fuzzy  constraint satisfaction in the
  field of  production  research,  and  especially  job-shop
  scheduling. The  fuzzy methodology  will  be  compared  to
  knowledge-based job-shop  scheduling techniques  that come
  from Artificial Intelligence.




#9    Fuzzy Logic Applications to Artificial Intelligence
      and Intelligent Control Systems

  Dr. Enrique H. Ruspini
  Artificial Intelligence Center
  SRI International, Menlo Park, CA

  We present  first fuzzy  logic as  a methodology concerned
  with  the   representation  and   analysis  of  vague  and
  uncertain aspects  of reality.   Using  a unified model of
  approximate-reasoning methods,  we discuss  the nature  of
  fuzzy-logic  methods   and   compare   them   with   other
  uncertainty-modeling  techniques   such  as  probabilistic
  reasoning.
     Using this  model, we  also show  that fuzzy logic is a
  sound  deductive  technique  relying  on  the  notions  of
  utility and  preference. Based on such a characterization,
  we  present   an  emerging   set  of  procedures  for  the
  development and  analysis of  fuzzy models.  Problems such
  as the  derivation  of  possibility  distributions,  their
  interpretation, the representation of vague knowledge, the
  integration of  multiple conflicting  objectives, and  the
  explanation of planning and control choices are handled in
  this framework  by means  of sound  procedures  rooted  on
  logical concepts and principles.
     We illustrate  the nature  of these techniques by means
  of examples  of their  application to  the development  of
  intelligent devices  and        systems. In particular, we
  focus on  the architecture  and operation  of  the  motion
  controller for SRI's Autonomous Mobile Robot, Flakey.



#10               Fuzzy Logic in Computer Vision

  Professor James M. Keller
  Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
  University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO

     Computer vision is the study of theories and algorithms
  for automating  the process  of  visual  perception.  This
  involves tasks  such  as  noise  removal,  smoothing,  and
  sharpening of  contrast; segmentation of images to isolate
  objects and regions and description and recognition of the
  segmented  regions;  and  finally  interpretation  of  the
  scene.   The purpose  of  this  tutorial  is  to  give  an
  overview of  the fuzzy  set theoretic approach to computer
  vision.   The applications of fuzzy set theory in computer
  vision in  the areas  of  image  modeling,  preprocessing,
  segmentation,    boundary     detection,     object/region
  recognition, and reasoning will be discussed.
     Techniques presented  are demonstrated  on real imaging
  problems.



#11                   Fuzzy Neurocomputations

  Professor Witold Pedrycz
  Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng.
  University of Manitoba, Winnipeg
  Fuzzy  neurocomputations  as  realizing  the  paradigm  of
  distributed  computations   integrate  essential  learning
  capabilities  of  neural  networks  with  the  schemes  of
  explicit  knowledge   representation  stemming   from  the
  mechanisms of  fuzzy sets.  This tutorial will address the
  issues  of  constructing,  testing,  and  utilizing  fuzzy
  neural networks.  The cornerstone of fuzzy neural networks
  is  that   their   processing   elements   (neurons)   are
  constructed with  the aid  of logical operations available
  in the  theory of  fuzzy sets.  Each neuron, as completing
  logical operations  on the  input stimuli, conveys its own
  clearly visible semantics. The two classes of neurons will
  be studied.   The  first category  of the neurons embraces
  aggregation  units,   while   the   other   one   includes
  referential operations.    The  studies  of  the  learning
  algorithms applied  to the  network will  include both the
  modified gradient-like  optimization methods  as  well  as
  schemes of  genetic optimization.   Those  latter  can  be
  stratified as  they pertain  equally well to the structure
  of the network, types of the neurons, and the character of
  the individual  connections.   Various applications of the
  networks will  be also  outlined including the utilization
  of the networks in designing fuzzy controllers.



#12                        Fuzzy Data Analysis

  Professor Dr. Dr.h.c.Hans-Jurgen Zimmermann
  Professor of Operations Research
  RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany

  This   tutorial   begins   with   definitions   of   basic
  terminology.  Following   this,we  discuss   methods   and
  techniques for  fuzzy data  analysis. Tools  discussedwill
  include algorithms  and software  for fuzzy    clustering,
  decision models  that use fuzzy inferencing techniques and
  approaches based  on combinationsof  neural  networks  and
  fuzzy models. The tutorial will illustrate thesetechniques
  by discussing  applications that  include quality control,
  imagesegmentation,  fault  diagnosis    and  petrochemical
  design.



#13 Applications of Neural Networks to Virtual Reality

  Professor Thomas P. Caudell
  Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering
  University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM

  The objective  of this  tutorial is to first introduce the
  topic of  virtual reality  and then  to show  where neural
  networks are  contributing to  this technology.    Virtual
  Reality  (VR)   is  a   form  of  advanced  human-computer
  interface technology  that embodies  a sense of immersion,
  interactivity, navigation,  and  exploration  of  computer
  generated virtual  worlds.   A relative of VR is Augmented
  Reality (AR),  where the user remains immersed in the real
  world with only small amounts of data being presented.  VR
  typically involves  opaque head-mounted displays that show
  only computer  generated graphics.   AR  uses  see-through
  head-mounted displays that show mostly the real world with
  small amounts  of computer  generated graphics overlaid on
  real  world   objects.     There  are  many  technological
  challenges left  to solve  before VR and AR are practical.
  Neural  networks   offer  solutions   to  some   of  these
  challenges,   This  tutorial  will  introduce  VR  and  AR
  technologies and  applications, introduce  the classes  of
  neural  networks  to  be  discussed,  and  illustrate  the
  application  of   neural  networks   to  this  field  with
  examples.



#14   Hybrid Systems: Neural, Symbolic, and Fuzzy

  Professor Lawrence O. Hall and Professor Abraham Kandel
  Computer Science and Engineering Department
  University of South Florida, Tampa, FL

  Neural  networks  and  expert  systems  are  complementary
  approaches  to   knowledge  representation   and  decision
  making.   This tutorial   concentrates  on hybrid  systems
  which incorporate  neural networks  to tune  expert system
  knowledge or will work in concert with an expert system to
  solve a  problem.   The basic  concepts underlying  hybrid
  systems are  clearly outlined.   The tutorial examines the
  question of  how to  incorporate knowledge  into a  neural
  network and  whether symbolic information can be extracted
  from a  trained neural network.  The tutorial examines the
  use of  fuzzy logic  in the  neural network  expert system
  mix.   This includes hybrid neuro fuzzy systems.  Examples
  will be given that show hybrid systems, properly designed,
  provide systems  more powerful  than any of the components
  used in a stand-alone fashion.



#15    Basics of Building Market Timing Systems:
         Making Money  with Neural Networks

  Casimir C. Klimasauskas
  NeuralWare, Inc.
  Pittsburgh, PA

  This tutorial will cover the basic principles for building
  successful financial  market  timing  systems.    Are  the
  markets predictable?  This is the foundation on which this
  talk is built.   Identifying which   markets and when they
  are predictable  is the  first step  toward  developing  a
  successful  system.     In   general,  the   objective  of
  developing a  neural network  trading system  is  to  make
  money.   Building a  system which  meets the objectives is
  the next  step and  primary focus  of this  tutorial.  The
  technological  measures   on  which  most  neural  network
  technology  is   built  often   fail  to  maximize  system
  objectives.     Various  approaches  to  addressing  these
  issues will  be discussed.  This includes what to predict,
  how  to   modify  standard  neural  paradigms  to  enhance
  ultimate  performance,   selection  of   train,  test  and
  verification sets, and data pre-processing.  An example of
  a  system  developed  on  recent  data  will  be  used  to
  illustrate the various issues in the talk.



#16  Practical Applications of Neural Network Theory

  Dr. Robert Hecht-Nielsen
  HNC, Inc
  San Diego, CA

  Neural network  theory has advanced significantly over the
  past five  years.   In this tutorial, theoretical advances
  in the  areas of  universal  approximation,  learning  and
  convergence, curse  of dimensionality  exorcism, and error
  problem-solving will  then be  described, with an emphasis
  on how  our  practical  efforts  can  be  guided  by  this
  theoretical knowledge.   Special emphasis will be given to
  the topic  of which  types of problems neural networks are
  good at  solving and  how  to  select  the  proper  neural
  network architecture for a problem.  The tutorial is aimed
  at those  with at  least  basic  familiarity  with  neural
  network architectures  and applications.   No knowledge of
  theory is  presumed and  no mathematics  beyond elementary
  calculus andlinear algebra will be used.



#17        Computational Studies of Biological
           Neural Networks: Introduction and Applications
           to Vision and Sensory-Motor Control

  Professor Paolo Gaudiano
  Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
  Boston University, Boston, MA

  This tutorial  introduces an interdisciplinary approach to
  the study  of computational  neural models  for uncovering
  the functional  designs that  underlie  human  and  animal
  learning  and  performance.    Through  a  combination  of
  psychological,     physiological,     mathematical     and
  computational notions,  the  presentation  will  show  how
  simple networks  of neurons  can develop useful functional
  properties  in   response  to   a  rapidly   changing  and
  unpredictable environment.   Next,  the presentation  will
  illustrate how  these fundamental  neural network  modules
  can be  embedded into more elaborate networks that exhibit
  complex adaptive  behavior,.   It will  then be shown that
  the same  fundamental modules serve as building blocks for
  other neural  network models  that can  explain biological
  function and  at the  same time provide novel technologies
  for practical  applications.   The presentation will focus
  on two  examples: one  model of  low level vision explains
  how the vertebrate retina rapidly adjusts its  sensitivity
  over an  enormous range of illumination, a useful property
  for artificial  vision systems;  the other model describes
  adaptive sensory-motor  control in humans and animals, and
  has   been   applied   successfully   to   visually-guided
  navigation of mobile robots.



#18    Learning Algorithms In Neural Networks

  Professor Jacek M. Zurada
  Computer Science and Engineering
  University of Louisville, Louisville, KY

  Learning is  a fundamental  property of networks acquiring
  computational intelligence.  Learning can be understood as
  a change  in behavior  brought about  by experience.    In
  neural networks  learning takes  the form of approximation
  of relationships  from  data,  or  the  form  of  encoding
  desired equilibria.  This tutorial reviews basic  concepts
  of supervised  and unsupervised learning of most important
  neural network  architectures.   The tutorial stresses the
  visualization of  learning  in  both  pattern  and  weight
  space.   It demonstrates  links between various methods of
  network adaptation  schemes.   The material  presented  is
  addressed to  persons interested  in pursuing  independent
  research/study/NN   modeling    who   are   also   seeking
  understanding   of   concepts   underlying   computational
  properties of neural networks.

                  Special Plenary Symposium
         COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  IMITATING LIFE
                   June 27 - July 1, 1994

For the  first time  in one meeting, the main threads of the
topics in computational intelligence are woven into a single
cohesive fabric.    The  Symposium  addresses  the  exciting
emerging technologies  and issues  relating to biologically,
psychologically and  linguistically  motivated  models  that
exhibit  various   facets  of   computational  intelligence.
Machine  learning   from   data,   neuro-fuzzy   information
processing, approximate reasoning, vision/qualitory modeling
and evolutionary  computation, are examples of computational
intelligence approaches  addressed  by  Symposium  speakers.
The  Symposium   provides  a   unique   forum   for   cross-
fertilization between  the areas  of neural  networks, fuzzy
logic, and evolutionary computation.

The Symposium  consists of three public lectures, 10 plenary
talks and  30 mini-symposia  presentations; covering  neural
networks  (21),   fuzzy   logic   (13),   and   evolutionary
computation (9).   Contributions  include research  that has
implications for  further progress  in the  field, state-of-
the-art  reviews,   followed  by  discussions  of  important
applications in  fields such  as robotics and control, image
processing, vision,  and biology.  The presentations will be
highly focused but still tutorial.

Symposium   speakers    represent   the   top   internationl
researchers and practioners of this cutting edge technology.
"Computational  Intelligence:   Imitating  Life"   companion
volume to  this Symposium  will  be  complimentary  to  each
registered participant of the Congress.

         ******************************************

#1 Evolution Strategies:  A Thorough Introduction

  Professor Thomas Beack
  Computer Science Department, LS XI
  University of Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany
  

     In addition  to  Genetic  Algorithms  and  Evolutionary
  Programming, the  Evolution Strategy (Evolutionsstrategie)
  by  Rechenberg   and    Schwefel  forms  the  third  major
  representative of  Evolutionary  Algorithms.    Since  its
  development in  the 1960's  at the Technical University of
  Berlin (Germany)  for  solving  experimental  optimization
  problems, the  computer algorithm  has  been  successfully
  applied to numerous hard continuous parameter optimization
  problems (an  application field where Evolution Strategies
  reveal their  strengths in comparison to the more familiar
  Genetic Algorithms).
     The  tutorial   presents  a  thorough  introduction  to
  Evolution  Strategies,   with  special   emphasis  on  the
  following  topics:   history  of   evolution   strategies,
  detailed presentation  and explanation  of the  algorithm,
  genetic operators and parameter settings,  self-adaptation
  of strategy  parameters, theory  of evolution  strategies,
  selected application  examples  of  evolution  strategies,
  evolution strategies  for neural networks and fuzzy logic,
  guidelines for  practitioners, and  comparison to  genetic
  algorithms and evolutionary programming.


#2     Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications

  Dr. Lawrence "David" Davis Tica Associates
  Cambridge, MA
  

     Genetic algorithms  are techniques for optimization and
  machine learning that have been applied to a wide range of
  real-world  problems.     This  tutorial  consists  of  an
  overview of genetic algorithms, a discussion of techniques
  for applying  them, a  survey of  areas in which they have
  been applied,  and  several    application  case  studies.
  Particularly stressed  in the tutorial will be traditional
  and  nontraditional   genetic  algorithms   for  numerical
  function optimization;  the  use  of  order-based  genetic
  algorithms for  combinatorial optimization; and techniques
  for hybridizing genetic algorithms with other optimization
  algorithms.



#3    An Introduction to Evolutionary Computation

  Dr. David B. Fogel
  Natural Selection, Inc.
  La Jolla, CA

  The impact  of evolutionary  thinking on biology cannot be
  underestimated.   Indeed, many  biologists  have  remarked
  that the  study of  life cannot be conducted reasonably in
  the absence of an evolutionary paradigm.  But evolutionary
  thought extends  beyond an  ordering principle of biology.
  Evolution is a process that can be simulated on a computer
  and used  for solving  difficult engineering  problems and
  gaining  insight  into  natural  evolved  systems.    This
  tutorial, aimed  at researchers  in  neural  networks  and
  fuzzy systems,  and beginners in the field of evolutionary
  computation,  will   introduce  methods   of  evolutionary
  computation. These  include genetic  algorithms, evolution
  strategies  and   evolutionary  programming,  as  well  as
  related  techniques.     The   fundamental   philosophical
  foundations  of   the  methods   will  be   discussed  and
  applications  will  be  described,  including  synergistic
  efforts  of   combining  evolutionary   optimization  with
  connectionist and fuzzy systems.



#4              Genetic Programming

  Dr. John R. Koza
  Consulting Professor
  Computer Science Department,
  Stanford University, Palo Alto CA
     Genetic programming  extends the  genetic algorithm  to
  the domain  of computer  programs and  genetically  breeds
  populations  of   computer  programs  to  solve  problems.
  Genetic  programming   can  solve   problems   of   system
  identification,  optimal   control,  pattern  recognition,
  equation  solving,   game   playing,   optimization,   and
  planning.  Starting with hundreds or thousands of randomly
  created programs, the population is progressively improved
  by applying  Darwinian fitness  proportionate reproduction
  and crossover (sexual recombination).
     Many   problem    environments    have    regularities,
  symmetries, and  homogeneities that  can be  exploited  in
  solving the  problem.   The recently developed facility of
  automatic function  definition enables genetic programming
  to  dynamically   decompose  a   problem  into     simpler
  subproblems, solve  the subproblems, and assemble original
  problem.   Experimental evidence  suggests that  automatic
  function definition  reduces the computation effort needed
  to solve  a  problem  and  produces  a  simpler  and  more
  understandable overall solution.



#5  Genetics-Based Machine Learning in Rule-Based  and
    Neural Systems

  Professor Robert E. Smith
  Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics
  The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL

  This tutorial covers the application of genetic algorithms
  (GAs) in machine learning.  Machine learning is introduced
  in  the   framework  of   control,  with  an  emphasis  on
  reinforcement  learning,   where  the  system  must  learn
  through a  exploration.   A brief  overview of GAs is also
  provided.   Given this  background, the tutorial discusses
  rule-based, neural, and fuzzy techniques that utilize GAs.
  A rule-based  technique, the  learning  classifier  system
  (LCS), is  shown to be analogous to a neural network.  The
  integration of fuzzy logic into the LCS is also discussed.
  Research  issues   related  to   GA-based   learning   are
  overviewed.   The application potential for genetics-based
  machine learning is discussed.



#6    Genetic Algorithms:
      Theoretical Foundations and Experimental Evaluation

  Professor Darrell Whitley
  Computer Science Department
  Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO
  

  The principle of hyperplane sampling will be examined,  as
  well as  exact theoretical  models of  a canonical genetic
  algorithm.   Other topics  include:   deception, remapping
  hyperspace, stochastic  hill  climbing  versus  hyperplane
  sampling and  the case  against gray      coding  for test
  functions.   Holland's schema theorem and the K-arm bandit
  analogy will be reviewed and critiqued.  Alternative forms
  of the  genetic algorithm  such as Genitor, CHC, Evolution
  Strategies  and   parallel  genetic   algorithms  will  be
  reviewed.   The practical  implications  of  the  existing
  theory will  be explored  with respect to implementing and
  applying genetic algorithms to complex problems.  Examples
  are given  where simple  theoretical  insights  result  in
  improved search on problems of more than 500 variables.



#7              An Introduction to Fuzzy Logic

  Professor James Bezdek
  Department of Computer Science
  University of West Florida, Pensacola, FL

  This tutorial  begins by  developing the  basis for  fuzzy
  models.  The  first  hour  starts  with  a  discussion  of
  uncertainty  in  models  and  its  importance  for  system
  design. Membership  functions and fuzzy set operations are
  defined. We  pose and  answer some  basic questions  about
  fuzzy models - e.g., where do they come from? how are they
  evaluated? how  do they  compare with  probability models?
  The second  hour presents two applications vignettes.  The
  first  considers  stabilization  of  the  simple  inverted
  pendulum.  We compare the  classical (linear feedback) and
  fuzzy control  approaches, and  discuss design issues such
  as tuning  and stability.   The second application area is
  segmentation of  image data.   Several approaches based on
  fuzzy and neural models are presented and compared.



#8          Fuzzy Sets in Constraint Satisfaction

  Dr. Didier Dubois
  Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse
  Universite Paul Sabatier,  Toulouse Cedex - France

  Constraint-directed search  is a very general and powerful
  methodology for  problem solving,  which  is  particularly
  adapted to  finite domains  involving  high  combinatorial
  complexity.   The aim  of this  tutorial is  to show  that
  fuzzy set theory and constraint satisfaction can be easily
  and usefully put together.  The tutorial will describe the
  approach pioneered  by Bellman  and Zadeh for the modeling
  of fuzzy constraints, and point out the difference between
  a fuzzy     constraint and an objective function,  address
  how to  imbed flexible  constraint satisfaction in Zadeh's
  calculus of  fuzzy relations,  whose aim  is to  propagate
  preference in  constraint networks,  and review  in detail
  the applications  of fuzzy  constraint satisfaction in the
  field of  production  research,  and  especially  job-shop
  scheduling. The  fuzzy methodology  will  be  compared  to
  knowledge-based job-shop  scheduling techniques  that come
  from Artificial Intelligence.




#9    Fuzzy Logic Applications to Artificial Intelligence
      and Intelligent Control Systems

  Dr. Enrique H. Ruspini
  Artificial Intelligence Center
  SRI International, Menlo Park, CA

  We present  first fuzzy  logic as  a methodology concerned
  with  the   representation  and   analysis  of  vague  and
  uncertain aspects  of reality.   Using  a unified model of
  approximate-reasoning methods,  we discuss  the nature  of
  fuzzy-logic  methods   and   compare   them   with   other
  uncertainty-modeling  techniques   such  as  probabilistic
  reasoning.
     Using this  model, we  also show  that fuzzy logic is a
  sound  deductive  technique  relying  on  the  notions  of
  utility and  preference. Based on such a characterization,
  we  present   an  emerging   set  of  procedures  for  the
  development and  analysis of  fuzzy models.  Problems such
  as the  derivation  of  possibility  distributions,  their
  interpretation, the representation of vague knowledge, the
  integration of  multiple conflicting  objectives, and  the
  explanation of planning and control choices are handled in
  this framework  by means  of sound  procedures  rooted  on
  logical concepts and principles.
     We illustrate  the nature  of these techniques by means
  of examples  of their  application to  the development  of
  intelligent devices  and        systems. In particular, we
  focus on  the architecture  and operation  of  the  motion
  controller for SRI's Autonomous Mobile Robot, Flakey.



#10               Fuzzy Logic in Computer Vision

  Professor James M. Keller
  Electrical and Computer Engineering Department
  University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO

     Computer vision is the study of theories and algorithms
  for automating  the process  of  visual  perception.  This
  involves tasks  such  as  noise  removal,  smoothing,  and
  sharpening of  contrast; segmentation of images to isolate
  objects and regions and description and recognition of the
  segmented  regions;  and  finally  interpretation  of  the
  scene.   The purpose  of  this  tutorial  is  to  give  an
  overview of  the fuzzy  set theoretic approach to computer
  vision.   The applications of fuzzy set theory in computer
  vision in  the areas  of  image  modeling,  preprocessing,
  segmentation,    boundary     detection,     object/region
  recognition, and reasoning will be discussed.
     Techniques presented  are demonstrated  on real imaging
  problems.



#11                   Fuzzy Neurocomputations

  Professor Witold Pedrycz
  Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng.
  University of Manitoba, Winnipeg
  Fuzzy  neurocomputations  as  realizing  the  paradigm  of
  distributed  computations   integrate  essential  learning
  capabilities  of  neural  networks  with  the  schemes  of
  explicit  knowledge   representation  stemming   from  the
  mechanisms of  fuzzy sets.  This tutorial will address the
  issues  of  constructing,  testing,  and  utilizing  fuzzy
  neural networks.  The cornerstone of fuzzy neural networks
  is  that   their   processing   elements   (neurons)   are
  constructed with  the aid  of logical operations available
  in the  theory of  fuzzy sets.  Each neuron, as completing
  logical operations  on the  input stimuli, conveys its own
  clearly visible semantics. The two classes of neurons will
  be studied.   The  first category  of the neurons embraces
  aggregation  units,   while   the   other   one   includes
  referential operations.    The  studies  of  the  learning
  algorithms applied  to the  network will  include both the
  modified gradient-like  optimization methods  as  well  as
  schemes of  genetic optimization.   Those  latter  can  be
  stratified as  they pertain  equally well to the structure
  of the network, types of the neurons, and the character of
  the individual  connections.   Various applications of the
  networks will  be also  outlined including the utilization
  of the networks in designing fuzzy controllers.



#12                        Fuzzy Data Analysis

  Professor Dr. Dr.h.c.Hans-Jurgen Zimmermann
  Professor of Operations Research
  RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany

  This   tutorial   begins   with   definitions   of   basic
  terminology.  Following   this,we  discuss   methods   and
  techniques for  fuzzy data  analysis. Tools  discussedwill
  include algorithms  and software  for fuzzy    clustering,
  decision models  that use fuzzy inferencing techniques and
  approaches based  on combinationsof  neural  networks  and
  fuzzy models. The tutorial will illustrate thesetechniques
  by discussing  applications that  include quality control,
  imagesegmentation,  fault  diagnosis    and  petrochemical
  design.



#13 Applications of Neural Networks to Virtual Reality

  Professor Thomas P. Caudell
  Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering
  University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM

  The objective  of this  tutorial is to first introduce the
  topic of  virtual reality  and then  to show  where neural
  networks are  contributing to  this technology.    Virtual
  Reality  (VR)   is  a   form  of  advanced  human-computer
  interface technology  that embodies  a sense of immersion,
  interactivity, navigation,  and  exploration  of  computer
  generated virtual  worlds.   A relative of VR is Augmented
  Reality (AR),  where the user remains immersed in the real
  world with only small amounts of data being presented.  VR
  typically involves  opaque head-mounted displays that show
  only computer  generated graphics.   AR  uses  see-through
  head-mounted displays that show mostly the real world with
  small amounts  of computer  generated graphics overlaid on
  real  world   objects.     There  are  many  technological
  challenges left  to solve  before VR and AR are practical.
  Neural  networks   offer  solutions   to  some   of  these
  challenges,   This  tutorial  will  introduce  VR  and  AR
  technologies and  applications, introduce  the classes  of
  neural  networks  to  be  discussed,  and  illustrate  the
  application  of   neural  networks   to  this  field  with
  examples.



#14   Hybrid Systems: Neural, Symbolic, and Fuzzy

  Professor Lawrence O. Hall and Professor Abraham Kandel
  Computer Science and Engineering Department
  University of South Florida, Tampa, FL

  Neural  networks  and  expert  systems  are  complementary
  approaches  to   knowledge  representation   and  decision
  making.   This tutorial   concentrates  on hybrid  systems
  which incorporate  neural networks  to tune  expert system
  knowledge or will work in concert with an expert system to
  solve a  problem.   The basic  concepts underlying  hybrid
  systems are  clearly outlined.   The tutorial examines the
  question of  how to  incorporate knowledge  into a  neural
  network and  whether symbolic information can be extracted
  from a  trained neural network.  The tutorial examines the
  use of  fuzzy logic  in the  neural network  expert system
  mix.   This includes hybrid neuro fuzzy systems.  Examples
  will be given that show hybrid systems, properly designed,
  provide systems  more powerful  than any of the components
  used in a stand-alone fashion.



#15    Basics of Building Market Timing Systems:
         Making Money  with Neural Networks

  Casimir C. Klimasauskas
  NeuralWare, Inc.
  Pittsburgh, PA

  This tutorial will cover the basic principles for building
  successful financial  market  timing  systems.    Are  the
  markets predictable?  This is the foundation on which this
  talk is built.   Identifying which   markets and when they
  are predictable  is the  first step  toward  developing  a
  successful  system.     In   general,  the   objective  of
  developing a  neural network  trading system  is  to  make
  money.   Building a  system which  meets the objectives is
  the next  step and  primary focus  of this  tutorial.  The
  technological  measures   on  which  most  neural  network
  technology  is   built  often   fail  to  maximize  system
  objectives.     Various  approaches  to  addressing  these
  issues will  be discussed.  This includes what to predict,
  how  to   modify  standard  neural  paradigms  to  enhance
  ultimate  performance,   selection  of   train,  test  and
  verification sets, and data pre-processing.  An example of
  a  system  developed  on  recent  data  will  be  used  to
  illustrate the various issues in the talk.



#16  Practical Applications of Neural Network Theory

  Dr. Robert Hecht-Nielsen
  HNC, Inc
  San Diego, CA

  Neural network  theory has advanced significantly over the
  past five  years.   In this tutorial, theoretical advances
  in the  areas of  universal  approximation,  learning  and
  convergence, curse  of dimensionality  exorcism, and error
  problem-solving will  then be  described, with an emphasis
  on how  our  practical  efforts  can  be  guided  by  this
  theoretical knowledge.   Special emphasis will be given to
  the topic  of which  types of problems neural networks are
  good at  solving and  how  to  select  the  proper  neural
  network architecture for a problem.  The tutorial is aimed
  at those  with at  least  basic  familiarity  with  neural
  network architectures  and applications.   No knowledge of
  theory is  presumed and  no mathematics  beyond elementary
  calculus andlinear algebra will be used.



#17        Computational Studies of Biological
           Neural Networks: Introduction and Applications
           to Vision and Sensory-Motor Control

  Professor Paolo Gaudiano
  Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
  Boston University, Boston, MA

  This tutorial  introduces an interdisciplinary approach to
  the study  of computational  neural models  for uncovering
  the functional  designs that  underlie  human  and  animal
  learning  and  performance.    Through  a  combination  of
  psychological,     physiological,     mathematical     and
  computational notions,  the  presentation  will  show  how
  simple networks  of neurons  can develop useful functional
  properties  in   response  to   a  rapidly   changing  and
  unpredictable environment.   Next,  the presentation  will
  illustrate how  these fundamental  neural network  modules
  can be  embedded into more elaborate networks that exhibit
  complex adaptive  behavior,.   It will  then be shown that
  the same  fundamental modules serve as building blocks for
  other neural  network models  that can  explain biological
  function and  at the  same time provide novel technologies
  for practical  applications.   The presentation will focus
  on two  examples: one  model of  low level vision explains
  how the vertebrate retina rapidly adjusts its  sensitivity
  over an  enormous range of illumination, a useful property
  for artificial  vision systems;  the other model describes
  adaptive sensory-motor  control in humans and animals, and
  has   been   applied   successfully   to   visually-guided
  navigation of mobile robots.



#18    Learning Algorithms In Neural Networks

  Professor Jacek M. Zurada
  Computer Science and Engineering
  University of Louisville, Louisville, KY

  Learning is  a fundamental  property of networks acquiring
  computational intelligence.  Learning can be understood as
  a change  in behavior  brought about  by experience.    In
  neural networks  learning takes  the form of approximation
  of relationships  from  data,  or  the  form  of  encoding
  desired equilibria.  This tutorial reviews basic  concepts
  of supervised  and unsupervised learning of most important
  neural network  architectures.   The tutorial stresses the
  visualization of  learning  in  both  pattern  and  weight
  space.   It demonstrates  links between various methods of
  network adaptation  schemes.   The material  presented  is
  addressed to  persons interested  in pursuing  independent
  research/study/NN   modeling    who   are   also   seeking
  understanding   of   concepts   underlying   computational
  properties of neural networks.
