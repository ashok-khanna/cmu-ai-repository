			Workshop on Static Analysis
			     Padova, Italy
			    September 22-24


The Third International Workshop on Static Analysis is held in Padova,
Italy, from 22-24 September 1993. The WSA'93 workshop is the third,
after Jtaspefl and WSA'92, which took place in Bordeaux (France).

This Workshop is devoted to theoretical and practical aspects of
static analysis. The intended audience includes researchers in the
field of static analysis, abstract interpretation, partial evaluation,
program transformation in logic, equational, functional, imperative,
object-oriented and constraint programming, both for sequential and
concurrent languages.

The workshop's advance program & hotel info are available via anonymous ftp
