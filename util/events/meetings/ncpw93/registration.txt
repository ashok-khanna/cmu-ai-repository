         2nd Neural Computation and Psychology Workshop

          Connectionist Models of Memory and Language

             University of Edinburgh, Scotland

                10th - 13th September 1993



AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
-------------------
This workshop is the second in a series, following on from last year's
very successful Neurodynamics and Psychology Workshop at the
University of Wales, Bangor.  This year it is to be hosted by the
Connectionism and Cognition Research Group at the University of
Edinburgh.  The general aim is to bring together researchers from such
diverse disciplines as neurobiology, psychology, cognitive science,
artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and computer science to
discuss their work on the connectionist modelling of memory and
language. There are special sessions on memory and models of reading.
The workshop has an invited list of speakers and a limited number of
participants to allow single-track papers and ease of discussion.  It
will run from the evening of Friday 10th through to lunch time on
Monday 13th.


THE PROGRAMME INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING TALKS:
-------------------------------------------

LANGUAGE PROCESSES:

James L. McClelland (CMU)
	"Learning quasi-regular mappings in tense marking and reading:     
				   How many mechanisms are necessary?"

Bob Kentridge (Durham)
		"Cortical Neural Computation, Language and Cognition."

Bob Damper (Southampton)
	              "Rules versus Connectionism in Pronouncing Text"

John Bullinaria (Edinburgh)
	     "Neural Network Models of Reading Without Wickelfeatures"

Trevor A. Harley (Warwick)
	       "Lexical access in speech production:  Data and models"


MEMORY:

Noel Sharkey (Exeter)
		    "A generalization of interference and trade-off in 
			   connectionist models of recognition memory"

Gordon Brown and Charles Hulme (Bangor, York)
		     "Mathematical and Connectionist Models of Memory"

George Dunbar (Warwick)
			"A connectionist model of lexical combination"

Dimitris Bairaktaris (Edinburgh)
		     "Dynamic Binding in STM Using Temporal Synchrony"

Jacob Murre (APU, Cambridge)
					"Forgetting and connectionism"


POSTER SESSION
--------------
So that other participants have a chance of presenting their work on
connectionist models of memory and language we are including refereed
poster sessions. It is still possible to submit a poster, but please
send submissions ASAP.

REGISTRATION, FOOD AND ACCOMMODATION
------------------------------------ 
The workshop will be held in Pollock Halls, an attractive student
residence close to the centre of Edinburgh with views of Arthur's Seat
and ample parking.  The conference registration fee (which includes
morning and afternoon teas and coffees, the three lunches, a reception
and meal on the Friday evening and dinner on Saturday) is 80 pounds
(or 65 pounds for full time students).  A special Conference Dinner
will be arranged for the Sunday evening costing 15 pounds.  Bed and
breakfast accommodation on site is 70 pounds (total for the three
nights).
