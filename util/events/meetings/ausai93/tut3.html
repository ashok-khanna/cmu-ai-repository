   TUTORIAL 3
 
   TITLE: "IMAGE PROCESSING AND CHARACTER RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES"

   PRESENTER:	Dr. Hong Yan (Senior Lecturer)
   		Department of Electrical Engineering
   		The University of Sydney
 
   VENUE:       Grand Hyatt, Melbourne
 
   TIME:        Tuesday, 16 November, 2:00-5:20pm
 
   This tutorial provides an introduction to image processing and pattern
   recognition techniques.  Specific topics include:

   (1) Basic image processing system structure.
   (2) Image enhancement: point, spatial and transform operations, full
       colour image enhancement.
   (3) Image restoration: observation models, filtering, and maximum entropy
       and generalised projection based restoration methods.
   (4) Image compression: error-free coding, prediction and transformation
       based techniques, vector quantisation, fractal models, and full
       colour image compression.
   (5) Image recognition: pre-processing, feature extraction, statistical
       and neural network based classifiers, document image segmentation
       and multi-font printed and handwritten character recognition.

   We shall also present our recent research results obtained in these areas
   in our Laboratory for Imaging Science and Engineering (IS&E) at the 
   University of Sydney

    PRESENTERS' BACKGROUNDS:

   Hong Yan received his PhD degree from Yale University in 1989. He is
   currently a senior lecturer in Electrical Engineering at the 
   University of Sydney.  His research interests include medical
   imaging, signal and image processing, pattern recognition, neural
   networks, and fuzzy logic.  He is an author or co-author of over
   100 papers published in engineering journals and conferences and the
   principal investigator of several major research projects.  Dr Yan is
   a senior member of IEEE and a member of SPIE, International Neural
   Network Society (INNS), Pattern Recognition Society (PRS) and
   Society of Magnetic Resonance for Medicine (SMRM).

   PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE:

   No priori knowledge of the area is assumed, but basic knowledge of
   calculus will be helpful.

	1993 AUSTRALIAN JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

		   AI'93 REGISTRATION BROCHURE

		       GRAND HYATT HOTEL
		      MELBOURNE, VICTORIA

		      16-19 NOVEMBER, 1993


	 An invitation to participate...

	 On behalf of the organising committee, we are very pleased to
	 invite you to attend AI'93, to be held in Melbourne from
	 November 16th to 19th. The Australia AI conference has grown
	 in stature over the years, and now attracts a growing
	 proportion of papers from throughout the world. This year we
	 have received over 135 papers for consideration, with around
	 45% coming from overseas.

	 The conference programme features three world-renowned experts
	 in very different fields of expertise. Earl Sacerdoti is known
	 for both his pioneering work in AI, and for his work on
	 technology transfer. Mary O'Kane is renowned for her work in
	 speech recognition. Our third speaker, Chris Wallace, is a
	 pre-eminent authority in machine learning. So you can be
	 guaranteed a wide variety of invited talks. There is an
	 extensive workshop programme, a wide range of tutorials, and
	 active technical sessions.

	 AI as a technology has not been without its problems. But
	 there is a growing presence of real applications in operation,
	 and a gradual understanding of the significance of the field,
	 which is reflected in the conference programme. It is also
	 perhaps one of the great research challenges, so we should not
	 be surprised at the controversy that continues to surround
	 AI.

	 We look forward to meeting with you and joining in a
	 successful conference.
