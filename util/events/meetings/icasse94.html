CALL FOR PAPERS


In cooperation with the IEEE Electron Device Society and
the University of Stuttgart (chair Prof.Dr. Herman Haken)
the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits organizes
the first

               International Conference on
       Applied Synergetics and Synergetic Engineering
                      (ICASSE 94)

June 21-23, 1993
Erlangen
Germany

General Chair:                       Dieter Seitzer
Programm Chair:                      Friedrich G. Boebel
Head of Organization Committee:      Thomas Wagner

Motivation

During the past decade synergetics have developed into an
interdiciplinary branch of science, which has made
important contributions to such different fields as physics
(e.g. laser dynamics), chemistry (e.g. chemical clocks),
biology (e.g. morphogenesis), medicine (e.g. brain function
modelling), computer and information sciences (e.g. models
for cognition and learning) as well as social sciences and
economics (e.g. modelling of economic cycles). In recent
years increasing attention has been devoted to the
application of synergetics to real world problems. Among
the lastest and most succesful applications is the
"Synergetic Computer", which has been proven to be an
extremely powerful tool for autoassociation,
classification, identification, OCR, texture analysis,
speech and motion recognition, etc. Furthermore the
investigation of nonlinear phase transition in solid state
and optical devices has helped to design hardware
realisations of Synergetic Computers, which are based on
the intrinsic synergetic properties of materials.


Purpose

The conference will serve as a forum for mutual exchange
between basic research workers and engineers as well as
between hard- and software specialists. As invited speakers
international leading experts will provide a thourough
overview on the present state of the art of applied
synergetics and synergetic engineering, including advanced
algorithms, optical and electronic devices and proposals
for synergetic hardware ("synistics"). The conference will
also serve as a kick-off-meeting to propel the development
of synergetic devices which are assumed to be a factor 104
to 106 faster than conventional electronic hardware.


Topics

Original papers will be solicited in the following areas:

Synergetic Modelling
will focus on the application of synergetic models to
problems in science and technology. The practical benefit
of using a synergetic approach must be clearly
demonstrated.

Synergetic Engineering
is devoted to the solution of engineering problems such as
quality control, image processing, automation, robot vision
and motion, surveillance, speech, motion and texture
analysis, OCR, etc. by synergetic means.

Synistics
includes promising synergetic effects in material sciences,
physics, chemistry and biology, which are believed to be
good candidates for synergetic hardware, like current
filaments in semiconductors, biopolymeres for holographic
memory etc., as well as design and proposals for synergetic
hardware devices and systems.


Proceedings

Proceedings will be available at the conference. After the
meeting all papers will run through an additional review
cycle and will be selected for additional publication in
the Springer Series of Synergetics.


Deadlines

Authors wishing to contribute to the conference should hand
in three copies of an abstract (about 300 words) by
December 12, 1993. For the abstracts submission by
electronic mail is possible for postscript files. The
abstracts will be reviewed by senior researchers in the
field of Synergetics. All authors will be informed on the
decision by the end of January 1994.
Full papers will have to be handed in by April 15, 1994.

Fraunhofer Gesellschaft

Fraunhofer Gesellschaft is the largest non-profit
organization for applied research and development in
Europe. It is designed to bridge the gap between
fundamental research on a university level and the
profit-oriented requirements of manufacturing. Its over
5000 scientific and technical staff members are organized
in 44 institutes located all over Germany. Among them the
Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS) focuses
its research and development activities on the application
of advanced algorithms and integrated circuits in real
production enviroments. With the help of IIS, Erlangen has
developed into one of the worldwide centers for applied
synergetics and synergetic engineering, which has been
demonstrated in 1993 by the first installation of a
synergetic computer in an industrial enviroment.

IIS supports potential users of high-end technologies by
conferences, seminars, counselling, training-on-the-job and
contract research and development ranging from testing and
application analysis of advanced algorithms to ASICs in Si
and GaAs as well as turnkey measurement and control systems
for the industrial floor.
