Conference Location and Travel Arrangements
The conference will be held at the Sheraton Gunter Hotel, 205 East Houston, 
San Antonio, Texas 78205. The Sheraton Gunter is one of San Antonio's exciting 
grand hotels, located in the heart of the historical theatre and financial 
district and only 100 yards from the picturesque San Antonio Riverwalk, in 
downtown San Antonio. Star shuttle provides service from the San Antonio 
Airport (from the baggage claim area) to all downtown hotels for a cost of \
$7.00 per person and $4.00 for each additional person. A guided tour featuring 
the Alamo, a row through the picturesque San Antonio river e.t.c. is available 
at additional cost (see registration form for details) 

Lodging Arrangements
The Sheraton Gunter has set aside a block of rooms for $95 single/double per 
night. To make reservations please call (210)227-3241 before November 18. A 
list of other area hotels is available on request. Please contact Uthra 
Venkatraman at (409)845-1870, FAX (409)847-8578 or email uthra@cs.tamu.edu for 
more information.

Conference Site
San Antonio is the ninth largest city in the United States. The glitter and 
glamour of the large city is blended with almost 300 years of history, creating
a unique atmosphere. The San Antonio river walk is a walk alongside the 
beautiful San Antonio river, which is surrounded by quaint cafes and is 
beautifully landscaped. The walk will be lighted up for Christmas. La Villita, 
San Antonio's original settlement and El Mercado, the Mexican maket, are 
situated nearby. So is the Alamo, where a small band of Texans were besieged by 
Santa Anna's huge army in 1836. Sea World, the world's largest marine life 
theme park, featuring Shamu, the killer whale, is also a must see in San Antonio
Fiesta Texas is a park located beneath 100-foot cliffs and a waterfall and 
features  rides, restaurants, shops and special events in four themed areas: 
Hispanic, German, Texas 20's Boomtown and 50's Rock 'n' Roll. The Mission Trail 
is America's most complete Spanish Colonial mission complex. Attending the 
Mariachi Mass on Sunday at Mission San Jose is a unique experience.Hemisfair 
park, the Rivercenter Mall, the Institute of Texan Cultures, the McNay Art 
Museum, the Witte museum, Brackenridge Park, and the San Antonio Zoo are other 
attractions of this great city, to name a few.
