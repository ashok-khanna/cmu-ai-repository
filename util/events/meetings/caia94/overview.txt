The 10th IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications
(CAIA-94) will be held at Marriott Riverwalk in San Antonio, Texas on March
1-4, 1994.  CAIA is devoted to advancing the application of AI techniques to
real world problems. This year's conference will emphasize both the
development of enabling AI technology and the issues involved in its
integration into products and processes. We are also seeking innovative ideas
for new application areas and new research and technology transfer paradigms.

August 31, is the deadline for submission of papers and proposals for panels,
tutorials and workshops.  For general information on CAIA-94, including the
full Call for Papers, send email to CAIA@CS.UMBC.EDU or try the Gopher server
