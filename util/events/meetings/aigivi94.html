                            Call for ABSTRACTS

         Workshop on Programming Paradigms for Artificial Intelligence

                           Tuesday May 17, 1994
                              Banff, Alberta
                                  CANADA

                      in conjunction with AI-GI-VI'94


There have been several efforts into merging programming paradigms such as
logic programming, functional programming and object-oriented programming.
The latter is gaining more and more ground in AI applications, but it is not
clear why this should be the trend.  Typically, each one of these frameworks
is ideal for certain kinds of problems while exhibiting deficiencies for
other kinds; no single approach is ideal for all problems.  So it is not
surprising that researchers are putting effort into incorporating and adapting
features from the different approaches, but this borrowing is not without
problems.  The time is ripe for an examination of which features are best in
which approach and why, of how transferrable these features are between
approaches, and of the effort involved vs. the results expected.

Logic, functional and object-oriented paradigms, among others, have sprung from
the desire to make the task of programming more akin to a specifically human
endeavour, rather than an endeavour of giving machines what they expect.  This
workshop aims at providing a perspective of the state of the art in programming
paradigms for AI and for expressing complex knowledge in general.  Its topics
of focus include, but are not limited to, the following:

  - Logic vs. functional vs. other paradigms
  - How close are we to declarative programming?
  - Do we even want to be close to declarative programming?
  - Should the competing approaches be merged, and if so how can this be done?


SUBMISSIONS

Individuals interested in presenting a paper at the workshop should prepare an
extended abstract or position paper of about 1000 words including references,
approximately 4 double-spaced pages.  The title page must include:  author's
name, postal address, e-mail address (if applicable), telephone and fax
numbers.  Electronic submission of abstracts (in either PostScript, LaTeX or
ASCII) is encouraged.  Abstracts should be sent to via e-mail to
popowich@cs.sfu.ca or to:

   Fred Popowich
   PPAI Workshop
   School of Computing Science
   Simon Fraser University
   Burnaby, British Columbia
   CANADA V5A 1S6

If there is sufficient interest, the proceedings will be published after the
conference in electronic format.


IMPORTANT DATES
   Submission deadline:        Friday March 4th, 1994
   Notification of acceptance: Tuesday April 5th, 1994


OTHER INFORMATION

The workshop is being held in conjunction with the Tenth Canadian Conference
on Artificial Intelligence (AI'94) and with the Graphics Interface (GI'94) and
Vision Interface (VI'94) conferences, at the Banff Park Lodge, in Banff,
Alberta.  Banff is located in the spectacular Canadian Rockies, the beauty of
which remains unsurpassed, and is just an hour and a half drive from Calgary.
The Calgary International Airport can be reached from many North American
cities via many different airlines.  In addition, there is direct bus service
from the airport to Banff, or alternatively one can arrange a limousine or
rental car at the airport.  The ski season usually ends around the 24th of May
at Sunshine, so ski enthusiasts may enjoy spring skiing at its finest.
For non-skiers there are many other activities to occupy their precious time.

uncompress registration.ps.Z

to print the form on your favourite laser printer at your Unix prompt type:
lpr registration.ps

There are two forms contained on one page.  (The reason the files are
so large is that the forms were created on a Macintosh but have to
