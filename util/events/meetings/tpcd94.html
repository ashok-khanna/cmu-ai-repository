FOCUS AND OBJECTIVES

The use of formal methods in the design of digital systems is steadily
gaining popularity. The  practicability of such techniques, however,
depends on the support of appropriate mechanized verification tools.

This conference is a sequel to the one held at Nijmegen in June 1992
and provides a forum for discussing the role of theorem provers in the
design of digital systems. The objective is to cover all relevant aspects
of work in the field, i.e. verification, synthesis and testing, including
original research as well as case studies and other practical experi-
ments with new or established theorem proving tools, including tau-
tology and model checkers.

The primary focus will be on the ways in which formal methods can
be incorporated into hardware design tools and hardware design me-
thodologies, rather than the theory underlying the theorem provers.

Topics of interest include the philosophy behind the incorporation of
formal techniques in design tools, hardware specification languages,
the design and development and evaluation of formally-based  tools,
and the integration of formally based design and verification with exi-
sting tools and methodologies.

The intended audience includes workers in the field of hardware ve-
rification as well as practising digital designers with little or no prior
knowledge in formal methods.

SUBMITTING A PAPER

Five copies of a complete paper (in English) should be sent to the Con-
ference Chair at the address given below to arrive no later than 25
March 1994.  Electronic mail submissions in a postscript format are
also acceptable. Papers must not exceed 6000 words in length, with
full-page figures counted as 300 words.  Each paper should include a
300 word abstract. All papers will be refereed and the final choice will
be made by the programme committee on the grounds of relevance,
significance, originality, correctness, clarity and the use of given
benchmark circuits (see below).

The conference proceedings will be published by a major publisher.

BENCHMARK CIRCUITS

A set of benchmarks has been provided by anonymous ftp
at goethe.ira.uka.de (129.13.18.22). The circuits as well as
detailed instructions on how to use them can be found in the directory
/pub/tpcd94/benchmarks.

All authors submitting a regular paper or a proposal for a tutorial are
strongly encouraged to make use of these circuits.

IMPORTANT DATES

The important dates are as follows:

25 March 1994:
	Final deadline for the submission of papers.
20 June 1994:
	Date for notification of acceptance.
8 July 1994:
	Final camera-ready copy due.
26-29 September 1994:
	Conference at Bad Herrenalb.

PROPOSALS FOR TUTORIALS

Proposals are solicited for tutorial presentations on relevant verifica-
tion tools and provers. The intention is that a tutorial will provide an
overview of the basic ideas behind the tool using a completely worked
out example, rather than a detailed instruction on how to use it, hence
the use of benchmark circuits is also suggested.  The tutorials should
include an assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the tools and
should concentrate on general issues such as security, robustness, the
degree of interaction required, the user interface, and the mathemati-
cal skill required of the user.

Proposals for tutorials should not exceed 6000 words in length and
should give a clear indication of the topic and structure of the presen-
tation. The proposals for tutorials will also undergo a review process
and it is proposed to have no more than 6 tutorials during the confe-
rence. Also welcome are proposals for demonstrations of working sy-
stems. Proposals for both tutorials and demonstrations should be sent
to the Tutorials Chair to arrive no later than 25 March 1994. The tuto-
rial papers will also be included in the proceedings.

PROGRAMME

The conference programme will start with a day of tutorials and is fol-
lowed by three days of presentations by contributing authors. The late
afternoon sessions will be reserved for demonstrations. The program-
me will also include invited lectures by prominent researchers in the
field of machine-assisted verification. The names of the invited spea-
kers will be announced in due course.
