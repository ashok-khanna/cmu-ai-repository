  The Fourth International Workshop on Inductive Logic Programming

                               (ILP94)

                      September 12 -- 14, 1994

                      Bad Honnef/Bonn, Germany
            Preliminary Program and Call for Participation
              Early registration discount until Aug. 9

General Information

Originating from  the  intersection  of Machine  Learning  and  Logic
Programming,  Inductive  Logic  Programming  (ILP)  is  an  important
and rapidly  developing  field  that  focuses  on  theory,   methods,
and  applications  of  learning  in  relational,  first-order   logic
representations.  ILP94  is the fourth in  a series of  international
workshops designed to bring together  developers and users of ILP  in
a format that allows  a detailed exchange  of ideas and  discussions.
Reflecting the growing  maturity of  the field, ILP94  for the  first
time will offer a systems  and application exhibit as an  opportunity
to demonstrate the practical results and capabilities of ILP.

ILP94 will take  place in Bad  Honnef, a small  resort town close  to
Bonn in the  Rhine valley  and adjacent to  the Siebengebirge  nature
park.  Participants  will be able to  take advantage of Bad  Honnef's
vicinity to medieval castles and of  the new wine season that  starts
at the time of the workshop.

Preliminary Program

The following papers have been accepted for plenary presentation:

Learning Clauses by Tracing Derivations
   Bergadano et.al.

Specialization of Logic Programs by Pruning SLD-trees
   Bostroem et.al.

First Order jk-Clausal Theories are PAC-Learnable
   de Raedt et.al.

Inductive Learning of Characteristic Concept Descriptions
   Emde et.al.

Inductive Logic Programming and Philosophy of Science
   Flach et.al.

An Efficient Subsumption Algorithm for Inductive Logic Programming
   Kietz et.al.

GRDT: Enhancing Model-Based Learning for Its Application in Robot Navigation
   Klingspor et.al.

MILP-a stochastic approach to Inductive Logic Programming
   Kovacic et.al.

A Learnability Model for Universal Representations
   Muggleton et.al.

Self-Saturation of Definite Clauses
   Muggleton et.al.

Inductive Metalogic Programming
   Nilsson et.al.

Effective Algorithmic Debugging for Inductive Logic Programming
   Paakki et.al.

Induction of Maximally General Clauses Consistent with Integrity Constraints
   Sebag et.al.

Mutagenesis: ILP experiments in a non-determinate biological domain
   Srinivasan et.al.

The Arguments of Newly Invented Predicates in ILP

A Note on Ideal Refinement Operators in Inductive Logic Programming
   van der Laag et.al.

These papers plus additional poster presentations will  be  published 
as a  GMD technical  report to  be  distributed at  the  workshop and  
available to  others from  GMD in paper form and via FTP. Publication
of an edited book is planned for after the workshop.

Systems and Applications Exhibition

ILP94 offers participants an opportunity to demonstrate their systems
and/or applications.  Please announce  your intention to demo to  the
conference office until  August 9,  1994,  specifying precisely  what
type of hardware and software you need.

Registration and Conference Office

Registration brochures are available from the conference office.
