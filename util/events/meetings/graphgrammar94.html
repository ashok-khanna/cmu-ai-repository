            FIFTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON GRAPH GRAMMARS
              AND THEIR APPLICATION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE

                        Williamsburg, Virginia

   	                November 13 - 18, 1994

The International Workshop on Graph Grammars and Their Application to
Computer Science takes place every four years. The previous workshops took
place in 1978 (Bad Honnef, Germany), 1982 (Osnabrueck, Germany), 1986
(Warrenton, Virginia, USA), and 1990 (Bremen, Germany).

The generic term ``graph grammars" covers the whole spectrum of methods and
techniques for the investigation of the structure of graphs and graph
transformations. The  topics of interest range from very theoretical to very
practical. Indeed, one of the aims of the workshop is to bring together
researchers in the areas of graph grammar theory and practice in order to
identify and discuss those open problems in graph grammar theory that are
most critical to its practical application. The topics of interest for the
workshop cover (but are not limited to)

On the theoretical side:

 * Node-, edge-, and hyperedge graph grammars
 * Concurrency, distributivity, and semantics of graph transformations
 * Term graph rewriting
 * High-level replacement systems and module concepts for graph
   transformations
 * Hierarchical definitions and decompositions of graphs
 * Using logics and forbidden configurations for defining sets of graphs
 * Combinatorial and graph theoretical properties of graph languages
 * Geometrical and topological aspects of graph and map grammars
 * Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages

On the applied side:

 * Programming concepts: semantics and implementation
 * Concurrent and massively parallel computation
 * Software engineering and modular systems
 * Concurrent and distributed systems specifications
 * Specification languages based on graph transformations
 * Actor systems and Petri-nets
 * Rule and knowledge-base systems
 * Developmental systems in biology and chemistry
 * Pattern generation and picture processing

If you would like to attend, please send 5 copies of an abstract (not
exceeding 4 pages of your proposed talk to Janice Cuny (address below) by
April 15, 1994.  The authors will be notified about the acceptance/rejection
of their presentations by June 1, 1994.  We expect to be able to provide a
limited amount of travel support for students. If you wish to receive such
support, please submit a brief description of your research interests along
with your abstract.

The workshop will be held in Williamsburg, Virginia from November 13 to
November 18, 1994. Williamsburg is located in an area of great significance
in US history.  The area includes Jamestown, the site of the first permanent
English-speaking settlement, Colonial Williamsburg, a restored 18-th century
village, and Yorktown, the site of a Revolutionary War battle.

Conference Chairpersons:

Janice Cuny (University of Massachusetts, USA),
Hartmut Ehrig (Technical University of Berlin, Germany),
Gregor Engels ( University of Leiden, The Netherlands),
Grzegorz Rozenberg (University of Leiden, The Netherlands).
