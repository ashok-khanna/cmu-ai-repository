	  Bar-Ilan Workshop and Seminar on Applied Constraint Reasoning
	          Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel
	          July 20-21, 1994 (the week following ICALP-94 in Jerusalem)

	  Guest Lecturers:
	      Prof. Bernard Nadel
	            (Wayne State University and consultant to Ford Motor Corp.)
	      Prof. Boi Faltings
	            (Ecole Polytechnique Federalle de Lausanne)

	The workshop and seminar will be of interest especially to those working
	in AI and Applications with the emphasis being on Satisfiability,
	Reasoning and Search Algorithms from a real-world point of view.  The
	orientation of the meeting will be informal in order to promote
	interaction and stimulate cooperative research.

	The guest lecturers will each give tutorial and research lectures.
	Topics covered will include:
	    "Constraint-Based Reasoning in Engineering"
	    "Constraint Satisfiability with Continuous Variables and Interval Labels"
	    "The TRANS-FORM Expert System for Automobile Transmission Design"
	    "Topology-Based Spatial Reasoning"

	Additional invited lectures by computer scientists from Israel and
	abroad will also be scheduled.  Contributed talks of 15 minutes each
	are hereby solicited.  An extended abstract should be submitted by
	May 1, 1994.  No formal proceedings are planned.

	For further information, please contact:
	     Prof. Martin Golumbic
	     Director, Computer Science Research Institute

	The study of constraints, whose origins came from computer vision work
	of the 1970's, is now a central topic of growing importance in tens of
	disciplines including artificial intelligence, computer science,
	robotics, operations research, management technology, constraint logic
	programming and others.  This is witnessed by recent international
	workshops and symposia where constraint processing is contributing
	exciting new directions in computational linguistics, concurrent and
	distributed computing, database systems, graphical interfaces,
	combinatorial optimization, programming language design and
	implementation, symbolic computing algorithms and systems.

	Solving constraint problems is based on the ability to represent and
	manipulate partial information about objects, i.e., constraints such as
	equalities and inequalities.  It often augments conventional notions of
	state, state-change, and control with notions of monotonic accumulation
	of partial information about objects of interest, and with operations
	involving constraints such as consistency and entailment.  Some
	practical applications in which constraint satisfiability problems
	naturally arise include medical databases, medical diagnosis natural
	language processing, circuit design, physical mapping in molecular
	biology, and temporal reasoning.

	Constraint satisfiability algorithms and their applications have been an
	ongoing applied research area to solve real-world problems.  Topics of
	contributed papers may focus on inter-disciplinary methods for solving
	constraint problems as well as constraint programming as a general
	paradigm for computation.  The domains of scheduling, planning and
	resource allocation are of special interest, as well as successful
	applications in hardware verification, user-interface design,
	decision-support systems, and simulation and diagnosis in model-based
	reasoning.
