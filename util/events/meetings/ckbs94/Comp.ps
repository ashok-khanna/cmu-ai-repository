CALL FOR REGISTRATION

Second International Working Conference on
COOPERATING KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS

June 14-17, 1994
University of Keele, England.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The objective of the CKBS series of conferences is to bring the researchers 
from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Distributed Databases (DDB) 
and industry together to discuss issues and solutions to problems 
that are inherently distributed. A CKBS may be viewed as an applied
multi-agent system, which distinguishes itself from the traditional 
multi-agent systems by having a stronger emphasis on real-world problems, 
where issues such as performance, reliability, consistency, organisational 
constraints, security and end-user facility are important. In this sense, 
a CKBS type approach amalgamates ideas from DAI and DDB for solving 
distributed problems, such as those encountered in Intelligent Manufacturing 
Systems, Air-traffic Control, Telecommunications Network Management, 
Distributed Sensor Networks, Distributed Decision-making Systems, 
Distributed Banking Systems, Distributed Office Procedures and Distributed 
Fault Diagnosis.

CKBS'94 is the successor to CKBS'90 which was held at Keele in October 1990, 
and in which both DAI and DDB researchers participated. CKBS'90 was 
considered by the attendees to be very successful and led to the formation 
of the International Special Interest Group CKBS-SIG, which is managed by the 
DAKE Centre at Keele.

An application domain that receives special attention in CKBS'94 is that of 
intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS), because of a growing need for a 
CKBS approach in many branches of this field, such as agent-based and 
flexible manufacturing, concurrent engineering design and knowledge and 
systems integration for manufacturing. It is hoped that this conference 
will provide a forum for the cross-fertilisation of ideas leading to better 
solutions of CKBS problems both within the domain of IMS and also within 
other application domains.

The conference is intended as a residential one with accommodation provided
within the campus, so that the delegates have greater opportunities for
inter-mixing and exchange of ideas. A distinctive feature of the CKBS 
conference series is the provision of a conducive atmosphere for discussions 
among the delegates, helping to produce new ideas. With this end in 
mind, each paper in the conference will be given 10 minutes of special 
discussion time following its presentation.

2.  CONFERENCE TOPICS

The conference has three components: Tutorial, Main Conference and Excursions, 
as described below:

2.1  Tutorial (afternoon of Tuesday, June 14) 

A half-day tutorial will be given by Dr. Michael N. Huhns (MCC, Austin, USA),
a leading DAI researcher on

	Distributed Artificial Intelligence for Information Systems.  

This tutorial describes the current state of research in distributed
artificial intelligence. It presents architectures, languages, and techniques 
for achieving coordinated behaviour among a decentralised group of intelligent 
computational agents, and describes successful applications of DAI in 
transaction scheduling, manufacturing automation and information retrieval.

2.2  Main Conference (Wednesday June 15 to Friday June 17)

The main conference has three elements:

	  Invited Papers
	  Contributed Papers
	  Posters and Demonstrations

The invited papers are:

          A DAI Perspective on Cooperating Knowledge Based Systems
          by M. N. Huhns (MCC, Austin, USA)

          The ARCHON Project and its Applications
          by N. Jennings (Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, UK)

          The IMAGINE Project
          by H. Haugeneder (Siemens AG, Germany)

It may be noted that ARCHON and IMAGINE are the two major CKBS projects
funded by the CEC ESPRIT Programme. These presentations will be the first 
comprehensive research reports on these recently completed projects.

All contributed papers have been selected from the extended abstracts
submitted to the conference. There about 36 such contributed papers,
including 10 papers related to Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, as
listed in Appendix A.  The authors are expected to submit full papers before
the conference. These, along with the invited papers, will be collected as 
draft proceedings to be circulated among the delegates at the conference. 
Following the conference, the authors will submit their revised full-papers 
(in the light of discussions at the conference) for a final review. The 
selected papers from this second review, along with the invited papers, will 
then be published by the DAKE Centre as the final proceedings. A copy of 
the final proceedings will be mailed to each delegate in due course.

In addition to the contributed papers, a number of posters will also be 
displayed on new ideas in CKBS, as listed in Appendix B. Some demonstrators 
may also be presented.

2.3  Excursions (afternoon of Thursday June 16)

Excursions are an important part of this conference, as these enable the
delegates to get to know each other better. These excursions are popular, and 
hence an early booking is strongly recommended to avoid disappointment as the 
number of places is limited. If we cannot book a place for you, we shall 
naturally refund your payment. This year we are organising two alternative 
events to choose from: (i) a visit to Stratford-upon-Avon, which was also 
offered in CKBS'90 and (ii) a visit to Chatsworth House which is new.

Stratford-upon-Avon

By coach to Stratford (about 1 and 1/2 hours each way), returning to Keele
around midnight. The price includes a ticket for an evening performance of 
a Shakespeare play, Henry V, in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. We shall try 
to give you a transcript of the play beforehand, so that you can follow the 
performance better.

The afternoon and early evening are free to wander around this historic
birthplace of William Shakespeare and take dinner (not included in the
price) as you like in Stratford before the performance, which starts at about 
7:30 pm. In CKBS'90, this excursion was considered a high point by the 
delegates, who also found the coach journey enjoyable. Please note that the 
Royal Shakespeare Theatre is usually booked long in advance, and therefore 
we advise you ensure an early return of the registration form. In CKBS`90 
many delegates applied too late for this memorable excursion.

Chatsworth House

By coach to Chatsworth House (about 1 and 1/2 hours in each direction). This 
classical mansion, which was originally built in 1555 and later altered by 
the first Duke of Devonshire in 1709, is one of the finest stately homes 
in England. The splendid garden was replanted in the 19th century, when the 
Emperor fountain was also added. The House contains a world-renowned
collection of paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, silver, porcelain,
curiosities and fine furniture. This is a popular tourist attraction of Britain.

You will tour the mansion, and later the great garden, at a leisurely pace 
following well-laid out directions. You will be there probably for about 
3 and 1/2 hours, returning to Keele at around 8:30 pm, just in time for you to 
sample some student fares at the Keele Campus or gentiles' fares at the 
restaurants in town (dinner is not included in the price). A restaurant list 
will be supplied. 

Other Possibilities

If you are not interested in these excursions then you can while away the
afternoon by wandering around Keele campus (quite pleasant), trying a round 
of golf (opposite the campus entrance), playing ten-pin bowling (5 miles 
from campus) or by visiting Chester - an old Roman town which is an hour by 
bus from the campus. The world famous Wedgewood pottery factory (6 miles 
from the campus) can also be visited.
