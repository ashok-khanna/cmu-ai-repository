A Call for Papers

                                      CKBS'94

			International Working Conference on 

			COOPERATING KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS

				June 15 - 17, 1994

			   University of Keele, England


Dear Colleagues,

Introduction
------------

CKBS'94, the second International Working Conference on Cooperating Knowledge 
Based Systems (CKBS) will be held, from June 15 to 17 (Wednesday to Friday) 
in 1994 at the University of Keele. A special emphasis will be placed this 
year on a CKBS approach to intelligent manufacturing systems, but papers 
from other areas are also invited.

The objective of the CKBS series of conferences is to bring the 
researchers from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI),
Distributed Databases (DDB) and industry together to discuss issues and
solutions of real-world problems that are inherently distributed. Such
problems can benefit from a CKBS type approach, which amalgamate ideas from
DAI and DDB for high-performance and robust solutions. Examples of 
interesting application domains are: Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 
Air-traffic Control, Telecommunications Network Management, Distributed 
Sensor Networks, Distributed Decision-making Systems, Distributed Banking 
Systems, Distributed Office Procedures, Distributed Fault Diagnosis.

CKBS'94 is the successor to CKBS'90 which was held at Keele in 1990, and 
in which both DAI and DDB researchers participated. CKBS'90 was considered 
by the attendees to be very successful and led to the formation of the 
International Special Interest Group CKBS-SIG, which is managed by the 
DAKE Centre at Keele.


Conference Themes
---------- ------

For CKBS'94, we have selected the application domain of intelligent
manufacturing systems (IMS) as a special theme, because of a growing need
for a CKBS approach in many areas of this field, such as  agent-based and 
flexible manufacturing, concurrent engineering design and knowledge and 
systems integration for manufacturing. A number of Programme Committee 
members are researchers in the IMS area. It is hoped that the conference 
will provide a forum for the cross-fertilisation of ideas leading to better 
solutions of CKBS problems in the various branches of IMS and other 
application domains.

Finally, despite our special focus on research in intelligent manufacturing
systems, we invite papers from other application domains as well. In fact 
we may run in the conference different streams, one for the research 
related to intelligent manufacturing and other(s) for the other domains, 
depending on the number of quality papers received. If necessary, the 
conference could be extended to Saturday, June 18.


Topics of Interest
------ -- --------

We seek not only papers from completed research work, but also papers on 
novel ideas even if the work is not yet complete. In addition, we would 
also like to see papers describing industrial problems of interest.  

It may be observed here that the CKBS research distinguishes itself from 
the traditional multi-agent research by having a stronger emphasis on 
real-world problems, where issues such as performance, reliability, 
consistency, organisational constraints, security and end-user facility 
are important.  The conference wishes to address three important (though 
not necessarily disjoint)  areas which should comprise the CKBS technology 
of the future:  (i) techniques, (ii) applications, and (iii) systems 
infrastructures - the latter providing the essential core technologies for 
the support of CKBS applications and techniques. A partial list of topics 
of interest to this conference is:

CKBS Techniques 

  * Agent Modelling 
  * Representations of Knowledge, Beliefs, Behaviours, Reasonings and Learning 
  * Planning, Task Decomposition and Scheduling 
  * Cooperation, Coordination and Negotiation 
  * Result Integration and Disparity Management
  * Preferences and Constraints Propagation 
  * Coherence and Performance Optimisation 
  * Languages and Communications Protocols

Real-world Applications 

  * Application Requirements
  * Experience with CKBS Applications
  * Application Simulations
  * CKBS Prototypes 
  * Imaginative Case Studies
  * Cooperating and Active Databases 
  * Cooperative Transactions and User-interfaces 
  * Cooperative Concurrent Design 

Infrastructures for CKBS Applications

  * Generalised Models and Architectures 
  * Interoperable Environments 
  * Directory Systems, Knowledge Consistency and Systems Integrity 
  * Flexibility, Adaptability and Scalability 
  * Systems Resilience, Reliability and Recovery 
  * Systems Responsiveness and Reconfigurability
  * Systems Development Methodology 
  * System Development Shells and Tools

Inclusion of topics in different areas is meant to give a flavour, but not a
definitive classification; also some topics can fit into more than one area.


Submission and Selection
---------- --- ---------

The list of topics cited above is only a guide; your paper need not belong
to any of these topics, provided it falls in the general CKBS area explained
earlier. If you have any doubt, please contact the address given below.

Please submit an extended abstract, not exceeding 2000 words, to reach here
by February 14, 1994. The abstract should include a comprehensive summary 
of the intended full paper to help evaluation. Email submission is preferred.
If you intend to submit a poster on your work or project, or if you wish to 
demonstrate your system, please write to us (preferably by email), again by 
February 14. We shall make the necessary arrangements for you. 

As was in CKBS'90, papers will be accepted for presentation on the basis 
of extended abstracts, and will be selected again (full papers) - following 
their presentation at the conference - for publication as proceedings. 
A special feature of the conference will be the extensive discussion of 
ideas, for which specific time will be reserved for each presentation. 
The authors will have a chance to revise their papers before submission
for the final selection, in the light of the comments received during the
conference. 


Further Information
------- -----------

CKBS'94 will be a fully residential conference, as was CKBS'90, giving 
greater opportunity for the delegates to get to know each other and more 
time for discussion and the exchange of ideas.

Key Dates 
  * Abstracts (under 2000 words) by Feb 14, 1994.
  * Intention for Posters and Demonstrators by Feb 14, 1994.
