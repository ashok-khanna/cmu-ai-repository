***** DOOD 93 *****

              Third International Conference on
          Deductive and  Object-Oriented Databases

        ADVANCE PROGRAM  and  CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

  December 6-8, 1993
  Scottsdale Plaza Resort
  Scottsdale, Arizona, USA

Sponsors:Arizona State University/Intelligent Information Systems
Lab, Bull Information Systems, American Express
  With support from ECRC, Germany; ASTEM/RI , Japan.
  In cooperation with the Commission of the European Communities,
  DGXIII.


SCOPE

Deductive databases and object-oriented databases are at the forefront
of research in the next generation intelligent database systems.
Recently research has focused on integrating the object-oriented
paradigm and rule-based deduction to provide a single powerful
framework for intelligent database systems. The primary objective of
DOOD'93 is to provide a common forum of technical discussions between
researchers/developers of deductive databases and object-oriented
databases, thereby accelerating the integration of the technical
outputs of these two areas. This continues the direction established
by the two very successful DOOD conferences held in 1989 in Kyoto,
Japan, and in 1991 in Munich, Germany.


INVITATION

The organizers of DOOD'93 are pleased to welcome you to Scottsdale,
Arizona.  DOOD'93 promises to be an interesting conference, with
papers that are truly representative of an international community.
Additionally, an exciting set of special activities has been planned
for attendees and their spouses that feature some of the unique
aspects of Arizona. The organizing committee would especially like
to call your attention to the Cowboy Dinner at Reata Pass on Tuesday
evening. Although this is an optional event, we hope that most
of you will participate, as it provides an excellent opportunity to
meet with colleagues in an Old-West setting.

in the desert, the surrounding atmosphere is virtually unchanged from
earlier times.  Depart the hotel at 6:30 p.m., dinner at 7:30 p.m.,

distinctive designs.  We will make a stop at Cosanti, a display of
Paolo Soleri's  architectural ideas which he is developing in
Arizona's desert environment. Then on to Carefree for lunch and
shopping in one of Arizona's most exclusive desert communities, where
many of the homes were designed or  influenced by  Wright.
