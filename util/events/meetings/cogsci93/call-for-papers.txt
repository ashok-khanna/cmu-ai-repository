                     Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the
                        COGNITIVE SCIENCE SOCIETY

               A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE ON COGNITION

                           June 18 - 21, 1993
                    University of Colorado at Boulder

                         with Revised Deadlines

This year's conference aims at broad coverage of the many and diverse 
methodologies and topics that comprise Cognitive Science.  In addition
to computer modeling, the meeting will feature research in computational, 
theoretical, and psycho-linguistics; cognitive neuroscience; conceptual 
change and education; artificial intelligence; philosophical foundations;
human-computer interaction and a number of other approaches to the 
study of cognition. 

A plenary session honoring the memory of Allen Newell is scheduled. 

Plenary addresses will be given by:

        Alan Baddeley       Andy DiSessa           Paul Smolensky 
                 Sandra Thompson         Bonnie Webber

The conference will also highlight invited research papers:

  Conceptual Change:      (Organizers: Nancy Songer & Walter Kintsch)
      Frank Keil          Gaea Leinhardt     Ashwin Ram      Jeremy Rochelle

  Language Learning:      (Organizers: Paul Smolensky & Walter Kintsch)
      Michael Brent       Robert Frank       Brian MacWhinney

  Situated Action:        (Organizer: James Martin)
      Leslie Kaebling     Pattie Maes        Bonnie Nardi    Alonso Vera

  Visual Perception & Cognitive Neuroscience: (Organizer: Michael Mozer)
      Marlene Behrmann    Robert Jacobs      Hal Pashler     David Plaut

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
  With the goal of assembling a high-quality program representative of the
  diversity of methods and topics in cognitive science, we invite papers 
  presenting interdisciplinary research addressing any cognitive domain and 
  using any of the diverse methodologies of the field.  Papers are
specifically 
  solicited which address the topics of the invited research sessions listed 
  above. 

  Authors should submit five (5) copies of the paper in hard copy form to:

        Cognitive Science 1993 Submissions

DAVID MARR MEMORIAL PRIZES FOR EXCELLENT STUDENT PAPERS
  Papers with a student first author will be eligible to compete for a David 
  Marr Memorial Prize for excellence in research and presentation.  The David 
  Marr Prizes are accompanied by a $300.00 honorarium, and are funded by an 
  anonymous donor.

LENGTH
  Papers must be a maximum of six (6) pages long (excluding only the cover 
  page), must have at least 1 inch margins on all sides, and must use no 
  smaller that 10 point type.  Camera-ready versions will be required only 
  after authors are notified of acceptance.

COVER PAGE
  Each copy of the paper must include a cover page, separate from the body
  of the paper, which includes, in order:

  1. Title of paper.
  2. Full names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses 
     (if possible) of all authors.
  3. An abstract of no more than 200 words.
  4. The area(s) in which the paper should be reviewed.  When possible, please 
     list, in decreasing order of relevance, 1-3 of the following keywords: 
       action/motor control, acquisition/learning, cognitive architecture, 
       cognitive neuroscience, connectionism, conceptual change/education,
       decision making, foundations, human-computer interaction, language 
       (indicate subarea), memory, reasoning and problem solving, perception,
       situated action/cognition, skill/expertise.
  5. Preference for presentation format: Talk or poster, talk only, poster
     only.  Poster sessions will be highlighted in this year's conference. The 
     proceedings will not distinguish between papers presented orally and
     those presented as posters.
  6. A note stating if the paper is eligible to compete for a Marr Prize.
     For jointly authored papers, include a note from the student author's
     advisor explaining the student's contribution to the research.

DEADLINE

  *****    PAPERS ARE DUE FEBRUARY 2, 1993.    ******
