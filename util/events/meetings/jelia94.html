                         J E L I A '9 4

             4th European Workshop on Logics in AI

                    York, September 5-8, 1994


                        Call for Papers
                        ---------------

The European Workshop on Logics in AI provides a major biennial forum
for the discussion of logic-oriented approaches to artificial
intelligence.  Following previous meetings in France (1988), The
Netherlands (1990) and Germany (1992), the fourth workshop will be
held in York, England, from 5-8 September 1994. The workshop will be
hosted by the Intelligent Systems Group at the University of York.

The 1994 workshop is sponsored by the ESPRIT NOE COMPULOG-NET, the
Association for Logic Programming - UK Branch (ALP-UK) and the German
Informatics Society (GI). Further sponsors are currently being sought,
and it is hoped that some grants may be made available to students.

As in previous workshops, the aim is to bring together researchers
involved in all aspects of logic in artificial intelligence.  The
workshop will include submitted contributions and a small number of
invited papers, all of which will be presented in plenary sessions.
Papers are sought in areas which include (but are not limited to) the
following topics:

    o  foundations of logic programming and
       knowledge-based systems
    o  automated theorem proving
    o  knowledge representation
    o  modal, epistemic and temporal logics
    o  constructive and many-valued logics
    o  nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision
    o  abductive and inductive reasoning
    o  partial and dynamic logics
    o  hybrid reasoning systems
    o  applications of logic-based systems

In addition, a particular emphasis of the 1994 workshop will be the
use of Logic Programming for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,
and research papers in this area are encouraged.

All submitted papers will be refereed by an international programme
committee and selections will be made on the basis of originality and
significance.


                 Submission Requirements

Authors are asked to submit five (5) copies of their papers to the
first Programme Co-Chair (Luis Pereira) by Monday the 14th of
February, 1994.  Notification of acceptance or rejection will be
mailed to the first (or designated) author in April 1994, and camera
ready copies for inclusion in the Workshop Proceedings will be due in
May. It is expected that the Proceedings will be published by
Springer-Verlag, as in previous workshops, and made available at York.

Each copy of submitted papers should include a separate title page
giving the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses (where
available) of all authors, and a list of keywords identifying the
subject area of the paper.

Papers should be a maximum of 16 pages (including title, abstract,
figures and diagrams, but excluding references and the separate title
page), and printed on A4 paper in 12 point type with a maximum of 38
lines per page and 75 characters per line (corresponding to LaTeX
article style, 12 point). Double-sided submissions are preferred.
Electronic or faxed submissions will not be accepted.

Further enquiries should be addressed to the Workshop Chair at the
address below.

                    About the Venue...

York is one of the United Kingdom's most historic cities. Originally
known as Eboracum, it began life as a fortress built by the Romans in
AD71, and was home to the accession of Constantine the Great to Roman
Emperor in AD306. The city is best known for its Viking links, forming
the centre of the Viking Kingdom of Jorvik, from which it derives its
present name. The Normans had a more lasting influence, however, and
helped York become a major centre of government and religion in the
North.

The evidence of York's past is retained in its historic buildings and
museums, making it one of England's most popular tourist destinations.
Attractions include the York Minster - the largest medieval cathedral
in Northern Europe, built between 1220 and 1472; the City Walls, first
built by the Romans and later strengthened by the Normans; and
Clifford's Tower---a castle keep built by Henry III.

A short drive from York are two striking areas of natural beauty: the
Yorkshire Dales National Park (home of the writer James Herriot) and
the North York Moors National Park.

York is situated on the high speed rail link between London and
Edinburgh and is approximately a two hour journey from London by
train. It can also be accessed via a direct rail link to Manchester
Airport, and is less than half an hour's journey from the
Leeds/Bradford Airport. The University itself is built around an
artificial lake on the grounds of an old manor house, about two miles
from the centre of York. Accommodation is available both on and off
the campus.

                    About the Venue...

York is one of the United Kingdom's most historic cities. Originally
known as Eboracum, it began life as a fortress built by the Romans in
AD71, and was home to the accession of Constantine the Great to Roman
Emperor in AD306. The city is best known for its Viking links, forming
the centre of the Viking Kingdom of Jorvik, from which it derives its
present name. The Normans had a more lasting influence, however, and
helped York become a major centre of government and religion in the
North.

The evidence of York's past is retained in its historic buildings and
museums, making it one of England's most popular tourist destinations.
Attractions include the York Minster - the largest medieval cathedral
in Northern Europe, built between 1220 and 1472; the City Walls, first
built by the Romans and later strengthened by the Normans; and
Clifford's Tower---a castle keep built by Henry III.

A short drive from York are two striking areas of natural beauty: the
Yorkshire Dales National Park (home of the writer James Herriot) and
the North York Moors National Park.

York is situated on the high speed rail link between London and
Edinburgh and is approximately a two hour journey from London by
train. It can also be accessed via a direct rail link to Manchester
Airport, and is less than half an hour's journey from the
Leeds/Bradford Airport. The University itself is built around an
artificial lake on the grounds of an old manor house, about two miles
from the centre of York. Accommodation is available both on and off
the campus.

{\Large\bf Final Call for Papers}
\end{center}

The European Workshop on Logics in AI provides a major biennial forum
for the discussion of logic-oriented approaches to artificial
intelligence.  Following previous meetings in France (1988), The
Netherlands (1990) and Germany (1992), the fourth workshop will be
held in York, England, from 5--8 September 1994. The workshop will be
hosted by the Intelligent Systems Group at the University of York.

The 1994 workshop is sponsored by the ESPRIT NOE COMPULOG-NET, the
Association for Logic Programming - UK Branch (ALP-UK) and the German
Informatics Society (GI). Further sponsors are currently being sought,
and it is hoped that some grants may be made available to students.

As in previous workshops, the aim is to bring together researchers
involved in all aspects of logic in artificial intelligence. The
workshop will include submitted contributions and invited papers, all
of which will be presented in plenary sessions. 
Papers are sought in areas which include (but are not limited to) the
following topics:

\begin{minipage}{3in}
\begin{itemize}
\item foundations of logic programming and knowledge-based systems 
\item automated theorem proving
\item knowledge representation 
\item modal, epistemic and temporal logics
\item constructive and many-valued logics
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\hspace*{0.5cm}
\begin{minipage}{2.7in}
\begin{itemize} 
\item nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision
\item abductive and inductive reasoning
\item partial and dynamic logics
\item hybrid reasoning systems
\item applications of logic-based systems
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

In addition, a particular emphasis of the 1994 workshop will be the
use of Logic Programming for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,
and research papers in this area are encouraged.

All submitted papers will be refereed and selections made on the basis
of originality and significance. Camera-ready versions of accepted
papers will be included in the Proceedings, which are expected to be
published by Springer-Verlag in the {\em Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence\/} series, and will be available at the workshop.

use of Logic Programming for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning,
and research papers in this area are encouraged.

All submitted papers will be refereed and selections made on the basis
of originality and significance. Camera-ready versions of accepted
papers will be included in the Proceedings, which are expected to be
published by Springer-Verlag in the `Lecture Notes in Artificial
Intelligence' series, and will be available at the workshop.

                    About the Venue...

York is one of the United Kingdom's most historic cities. Originally
known as Eboracum, it began life as a fortress built by the Romans in
AD71, and was home to the accession of Constantine the Great to Roman
Emperor in AD306. The city is best known for its Viking links, forming
the centre of the Viking Kingdom of Jorvik, from which it derives its
present name. The Normans had a more lasting influence, however, and
helped York become a major centre of government and religion in the
North.

The evidence of York's past is retained in its historic buildings and
museums, making it one of England's most popular tourist destinations.
Attractions include the York Minster - the largest medieval cathedral
in Northern Europe, built between 1220 and 1472; the City Walls, first
built by the Romans and later strengthened by the Normans; and
Clifford's Tower---a castle keep built by Henry III.

A short drive from York are two striking areas of natural beauty: the
Yorkshire Dales National Park (home of the writer James Herriot) and
the North York Moors National Park.

York is situated on the high speed rail link between London and
Edinburgh and is approximately a two hour journey from London by
train. It can also be accessed via a direct rail link to Manchester
Airport, and is less than half an hour's journey from the
Leeds/Bradford Airport. The University itself is built around an
artificial lake on the grounds of an old manor house, about two miles
from the centre of York. Accommodation is available both on and off
the campus.
