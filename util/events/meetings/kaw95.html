                     Call for Participation KAW'95
  Ninth Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based Systems Workshop
            Banff, Canada, February 26-March 3, 1995


The objective of the annual knowledge-acquisition workshops is to provide a
forum for those developing theories, methods, systems, and empirical
studies that relate to the process of building intelligent systems of all
kinds.

To encourage vigorous interaction and exchange of ideas, the workshop will
be kept small--to about 40 participants. The format is designed to develop
extensive discussions and continuing collaboration on significant issues;
thus, the majority of the workshop will be devoted to activities within
small working groups that each will meet for one or two days, in parallel
with other workshop activities over the course of the week. In plenary
sessions, we will attempt to define the state of the art and future
research needs.  General attendance will be limited to those submitting
their work, one author per paper.

The meeting is structured to support specialist subgroups that will have
their own working agendas, as well as plenary meetings for general
knowledge exchange. In addition to the submission of papers, we welcome
proposals for new specialist sessions and minitracks that may include a small
number of invited participants who can help investigators in the area of
knowledge acquisition to form bridges with other research communities.

Eight sessions or minitracks have so far been scheduled for the workshop.
The corresponding topics, and the organizers of the sessions, are as
follows:

1.  Shareable and reusable ontologies
      Doug Skuce           doug@csi.UOttawa.CA          (U of Ottawa)

2.  Shareable and reusable problem-solving methods
      Bill Birmingham      wpb@eecs.umich.edu           (U of Michigan)
      Guus Schreiber       guus@swi.psy.uva.nl          (U of Amsterdam)

3. Knowledge acquisition from natural language
      Fernando Gomez       gomez@cs.ucf.edu        (U Central Florida)

4. Knowledge, cognition and cyberspace - cognitive aspects of KA
      Walter van de Velde  walter@arti17.vub.ac.be      (Vrije U Brussel)

5.  Knowledge acquisition and requirements engineering
      Rudi Studer          studer@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de (U of Karlsruhe)
      Bill Swartout        swartout@isi.edu             (ISI)

6.  Knowledge acquisition using conceptual graphs
      Dickson Lukose       lukose@peirce.une.edu.au     (U of New England)
      Marie-Laure Mugnier  mugnier@lirmm.fr             (CNRS U Montpellier)

7. Evaluation of knowledge-acquisition methodologies
      John H. Gennari      gennari@camis.stanford.edu   (Stanford U)
      Paul Compton         compton@cs.unsw.oz.au        (U New South Wales)

8. System demonstrations -- Sun, Mac, PC and Internet
      Rob Kremer           kremer@cpsc.ucalgary.ca      (U Calgary)


Individuals who feel they have a new perspective to offer which does
not fit into a specialist session are also invited to submit papers.
Such papers are especially welcome, but will be expected to offer
significant new insights.

Draft papers (up to 20 pages) should be sent electronically to Brian Gaines
before September 30, 1994. Acceptance and revision notices will be e-mailed
by November 15, 1994. Revised papers (20 pages) should be submitted by
January 15, 1995, so that hardcopies may be bound together for distribution
at the workshop.

For KAW'95, submission and review of papers, and coordination of all
aspects of the meeting will be through the Internet.  Papers should be
transmitted in postscript or common document processor format either by
e-mail to gaines@cpsc.ucalgary.ca, or by ftp to ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca in
directory /incoming (with an email note to gaines@cpsc.ucalgary.ca when the
paper is transferred).

Authors should indicate appropriate sessions/minitracks for each
submission.  If there is uncertainty regarding the optimum track for a
paper, authors should contact the chairs of the track that seems closest,
preferably in advance of the submission deadline.  Depending on the range
of papers received, some tracks may be collapsed whereas other tracks may
be added in advance of the workshop.

Demonstrations of mature software systens will be an important feature of
the workshop, and a range of high-performance workstations will be
provided. Authors submitting to this track should contact Rob Kremer about
the logistics of setting up demonstrations and showing videos.

Participation by graduate students is particularly encouraged. There will
be a number of studentships at a reduced fee for full-time graduate
students whose papers are accepted.  If appropriate, please indicate that
you wish to apply for such a studentship when you submit a paper.

WWW, world wide web, will be used to coordinate the meeting and further
details of the tracks, paper formats, conference arrangements, etc, will
be posted to the web through:
