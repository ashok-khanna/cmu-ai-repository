Dear colleague,
there will be a workshop on speech acts and linguistic research at the First 
International Summer Institute in Cognitive Science held in  Buffalo this July, 
1994. You are invited to participate.
Best regards
                                                            Elisabetta Fava

 Call for Papers 
for  a Workshop on 
"SPEECH ACTS AND LINGUISTIC RESEARCH"

A participant symposium
to be held during the
FIRST INTERNATIONAL SUMMER INSTITUTE IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
(FISI-CS)
Center for Cognitive Science
State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo NY, USA 
(Amherst Campus)
July 16-17, 1994

PURPOSE
The aim of the workshop is to discuss some issues concerning the interrelations 
of speech acts  and linguistic theory.  The state of the art suggests that this 
interface has been only partially explored.  On the one hand, only a few of the 
language phenomena dealt with in speech act theory have been the object of  
intensive research in linguistic theory. On the other hand,  the literature on 
speech acts has revealed only desultory interest in linguistic theories.
Contributions to the workshop may be either on methodological or on 
theoretical issues. Our aim is to do justice to the interdisciplinary 
complexity  of this interface and evaluate its relevance in the development of
 cognitive science; to discuss general problems posed by different analyses; to
 bring under scrutiny theoretical assumptions  taken for granted in recent
 analyses, which  may not be so  obvious as they seem;  to investigate how even
 apparently minimal choices in the description of phenomena may affect the form
 and complexity of the interface; and to stress the theoretical and 
methodological relevance of the tools developed in this area by focusing on
 empirical data of different languages.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Possible topics for papers might includes: 

- meaning and illocutionary force
- the role of illocutionary literal force
- acts, actions and language
- speech acts and Universal Grammar
- linguistic variations and their bearings on a theory of language; historical 
change (morphologization and  demorphologization rules in speech acts, 
etc.); cross linguistic variations in the grammaticalization of different kinds 
of speech acts; variations within the same language (consider puzzling 
phenomena  such as questions presenting both Wh movement or Wh  in 
situ,  single or Multiple Wh questions, presence of finite and infinite verb 
forms in main clause, mood distinctions, etc.)
 - formal versus functional analysis of speech acts grammatical strategies 
(morphology and inflectional moods, clitic affixation and syntactic 
constituency,  movement rules in syntax, etc.)  
- the lexicon (speech acts types and the structure of the lexicon,  semantic 
structure in lexical forms, etc.) 
- speech acts representations in grammatical  theory
- speech acts units and linguistic units
- phenomena that can to be regarded as depending on linguistic  competence  
or on standardised linguistic performance 
-  a grammar free from pragmatics or a pragmatics free from grammar?
- speech acts distinctions in the history of linguistic thought
- ambiguity, conventionality, indirectness and linguistic forms
- sociocultural determinants and cross linguistic variations
- different cultures and different conceptualisation
- linguistic and non linguistic aspects of rules and conventions in conversation
- directness, indirectness, politeness and 'cultural scripts' in cross-cultural 
approaches   
- contributions from language acquisition (bilingualism, first language 
acquisition)
- conversational analysis, ethnomethodology  and linguistic structures
- communication processes
