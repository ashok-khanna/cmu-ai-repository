                   CALL FOR PAPERS---EuroCOLT '95
                   Second European Conference on
                   Computational Learning Theory

                   	Barcelona, Spain
                       March 13-15, 1995

The Second European Conference on Computational Learning Theory 
(EuroCOLT'95)  will  be  held  at  the  Universitat Polytecnica
de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, from Monday, March 13, through Wednesday,
March 15, 1995.
(The inaugural European conference on Computational Learning Theory
was held 20--22 December 1993 at Royal Holloway, University of London.)

The EuroCOLT 95 conference is sponsored by the EATCS,
by the European Union through NeuroCOLT ESPRIT Working Group Nr. 8556,
and by IFIP through SSGFCS WG 14.2 and SSGFCS WG 14.4.


We invite papers  in  all  areas  that  relate  directly  to  the
analysis  of  learning  algorithms  and  the  theory  of  machine
learning, including artificial and  biological  neural  networks,
genetic and evolutionary algorithms, robotics,  pattern  recognition, 
inductive logic programming, inductive inference, information
theory, decision  theory,  Bayesian/MDL  estimation,  statistical
physics,   and   cryptography. We plan to include work in progress
of both theoretical and experimental nature,
with poster sessions to foster discussion, and authoritative invited
lectures. We  look  forward  to  a  lively, interdisciplinary meeting.


Abstract  Submission:  Authors  should   submit  thirteen   copies
(preferably  two-sided  copies)  of  an  extended  abstract to be
received by Thursday, September 21, 1994, to


                  Paul Vitanyi - EuroCOLT'95 
                      	     CWI
                 	Kruislaan 413
                      1098 SJ Amsterdam
                       The Netherlands

An  abstract  must  be received by  September  21,  1994  (or
postmarked  September 14  and  sent  airmail,  or  sent  overnight
delivery on September 20). This deadline is FIRM!  Papers that have
appeared  in  journals  or  other  conferences, or that are being
submitted  to  other  conferences,  are   not   appropriate   for
submission to EuroCOLT. Authors of countries where it is difficult
to duplicate manuscripts may submit a single copy or by email.

Abstract Format: The abstract should consist of a cover page with
title,  authors'  names,  postal and e-mail addresses, and a 200-
word summary. The body of the abstract should be no  longer  than
10  pages  with  roughly  35 lines/page in 12-point font.  Papers
deviating significantly from this length constraint will  not  be
considered.   The  body  should include a clear definition of the
theoretical model used, an overview  of  the  results,  and  some
discussion  of  their significance, including comparison to other
work.  Proofs  or  proof  sketches  should  be  included  in  the
technical  section.   Experimental  results  are welcome, but are
expected to be supported by theoretical analysis.

Notification: Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection
by  a  letter  mailed on or before Monday, October 31, with possible
earlier notification via e-mail. Final camera-ready  papers  will
be due on Thursday, December 15. The proceedings will be published
by Springer-Verlag, and will be available at the meeting.

Conference and Local Arrangements Co-Chairs: Felipe Cucker (University
