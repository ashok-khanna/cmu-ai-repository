           INVITATION TO ATTEND AISB WORKSHOP & TUTORIAL SERIES

 		     University of Leeds, England
 		        April 11th - 13th 1994

 		       Society for the Study of
      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


 The AISB Committee invites you to attend Workshops and Tutorials in the
 first AISB Biennial Workshop & Tutorial Series. In odd numbered years AISB
 holds a scientific conference with an attached workshop and tutorial
 programme.  In the intervening even years AISB is now starting an event
 which consists just of workshops and  tutorials without a main conference.

 The fact that many workshops are being held concurrently in the same
 place will provide an opportunity for attendees at one workshop to meet
 with those from other workshops during breaks and in the evenings. In some
 instances, it is also possible for attendees to attend more than one event.

 The workshops and tutorials which are planned are as follows. Note that
 if you require further information about a particular workshop or
 tutorial, you should contact the individual workshop / tutorial organiser.
 If you require further information about the Series, you should
 contact one of the Series organisers (listed below).

 	Models or behaviours - which way forward for robotics?

                      12th (pm) & 13th April (1.5 days)

Organiser:	Ruth Aylett, IT Institute, University of Salford,
			Salford M5 4WT
Committee: 	Dave Barnes, E&E Engineering Dept., University of Salford
		Dave Eustace, School of  Electronics,
			University College Salford

Abstract:
The original application of AI to robotics emphasised the need for
robots to reason symbolically about the world and their own actions. From
SHAKEY onwards, models were seen as central to these abilities. However, in
the mid 80s growing criticism of this approach produced alternatives such as
the Brooksian subsumption architecture in which the absence of models was seen
as a virtue and behaviours as the way to produce autonomous activity through
reaction and adaptivity. Neural nets and genetic algorithms have also been put
forward as a means of producing adaptive robots. More recently, various
researchers both in robotics and multi-agent architectures have investigated
ways in which hybrids of these contrasting approaches might be used.
What is the best way forward? This is a workshop for all those in robotics -
model-based, behavioural or hybrid - and in multi-agent architectures to
discuss in an informal and low cost setting how intelligent robots
might/should/could be produced.
Bring a robot - or a video (or even a simulation) - and your views.

Topics:
We would like the workshop to incorporate sharply different views of
the way forward for robotics. With this in mind we propose to invite two
key-note speakers, one for the model-based position and one for the
adaptive/behavioural position, to start debate going.
We would like participants to submit position papers on where they stand on
one or more of the following issues, and if possible to bring with them robots,
videos or simulations which illustrate their stance. Half a day of the workshop
will be allocated to such demonstrations.  Rapporteurs will produce a document
summarising the discussion during the workshop.

Questions:
Is the world always its own best model: if yes, how does it work as such,
if no, what should be modelled and how?
What, if any, is the role of internal state in a robot?
What sensor information do robots need? Should they actively seek it?
How could complex tasks be carried out - or should robots stick to simple
ones?
How could robots co-operate with each other? With humans? Is this
necessary/desirable?
How much autonomy can a robot have? How much should it have?
What does a good architecture look like? Why?

Required background:
research in robotics, multi-agent AI, artificial life

Acceptance:
On the basis of an abstract including any suggested robot
demo/video/simulation (max 1 side of A4). This to be expanded to a short
position paper (max 4 sides): these will be bound and handed out at the
workshop.

Timetable: 	Abstract: Jan 15th

        Computational Linguistics for Speech and Handwriting Recognition

                                CALL FOR PAPERS
                                ===============

             A one-day workshop organised by L.J. Evett & T.G. Rose
                    as part of the AISB 1994 Workshop Series

                                12th April 1994
                           Leeds University, England


ABSTRACT
========
Reliable speech and handwriting recognition cannot be achieved through
pattern recognition techniques alone. Natural language input is notoriously
ambiguous, and the application of higher level knowledge is necessary to
cope with this and other difficulties.

Previous attempts to implement linguistic knowledge have often employed a
logic based approach, drawing on a lexicon of symbolic information.
However, recent technological advances have allowed the development of large
text corpora from which probabilistic linguistic data may be derived.
Consequently, there has been a renewal of interest in techniques based upon
such statistical information.

This workshop aims to compare these two approaches, and evaluate their
present (and potential) contribution to speech and handwriting recognition.
The workshop will also consider related language processing problems, such as
parsing, word class formation, part of speech tagging, sense disambiguation,
discourse analysis, and the development of on-line lexical resources.

REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION

Please submit an extended abstract (max. 500 words) to the address below.
Email submissions are strongly encouraged. Authors of accepted abstracts will
be invited to write a full paper for inclusion in the proceedings.

Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice

			     April 11-12

Organiser:
Alan M Frisch, Department of Computer Science, University of York

Co-sponsors:
University of Leeds Centre for Theoretical Computer Science and the
University of York Intelligent Systems Group.

Abstract:

This workshop will provide an opportunity for the automated reasoning
community to meet in an informal setting to discuss recent work, new
ideas, and current trends in the field of automated reasoning.  It
will also provide an opportunity to get an overview of the many
specialised areas in which automated reasoning is progressing.

The scope of the workshop will cover the full breadth and diversity of
automated reasoning, including topics such as logic and functional
programming; equational reasoning; deductive databases; unification
and constraint solving; formal methods for specifying, deriving,
transforming and verifying software systems, hardware systems, and
system requirements; deductive and non-deductive reasoning,
including abduction, induction, nonmonotonic reasoning, and analogical
reasoning; commonsense reasoning; and the wide range of topics that
fall under the heading of knowledge representation and reasoning.

A large part of the workshop will be devoted to open discussion
sessions organised around specific topics related to the theme of the
workshop, "bridging the gap between theory and practice."  In addition
to ample discussion sessions, there will be open poster sessions,
giving all participants the opportunity to present their work.

This is intended to be an inclusive workshop, with participants
encouraged from the broad spectrum covered by the field of automated
reasoning.  We encourage the participation of experienced researchers
as well as those new to the field, especially students.

Required Background:  Some understanding of the pure or applied problems
in any subarea of automated reasoning.

Submission Requirements: Anyone interested in participating in this
workshop should submit a position paper by February 16, 1994, to the
programme chair at the address below.  The paper should address the
theme of the workshop, "bridging the gap between theory and practice,"
as it applies to any aspect of automated reasoning.  As an example,
one could address the design of logic programming systems that are
practical for programming yet are close to being pure deductive
systems.  Submissions must be a maximum of 2 pages of A4 paper with
one inch margins.  Authors either may submit three unstapled
hardcopies of their paper, or may email their paper in postscript.

On the basis of these submissions, invitations to the workshop will be
issued by March 3, 1994.  The position papers of all participants will
be assembled into an informal proceedings distributed to all
participants.  Participants wishing to revise their position papers,
may do so by March 15, 1994.

                    John Gooday and Nick Gotts
          School of Computer Studies, University of Leeds

			Wednesday 13th April

Abstract:

In the last few years  various calculi have  been developed to aid the
formalisation of spatial concepts,  many  based on temporal  reasoning
approaches.  These have enabled researchers in  fields such as AI, GIS
and  cognitive  science  to  begin  to  explore  shape,   orientation,
topology,  spatio-temporal     processes   and  spatial      knowledge
representation.  The purpose  of  this workshop  is threefold: (1)  to
provide the rapidly evolving spatial reasoning research community with
an opportunity to  meet and present recent work;  (2)  to evaluate and
compare  past  work with a   view   to identifying common  issues  and
establishing the extent  of  progress  to  date;  (3) to  discuss  the
possible direction of future work in the field and formulate an agenda
for spatial and spatio-temporal research. The workshop will consist of
refereed paper presentations,  discussion groups, a  panel session and
an invited talk   (Prof.   Christian Freksa,  University  of Hamburg).
Attendance  is by invitation only  and will be  strictly limited to 30
participants in order to ensure maximum interaction.


Relevant  discussion topics  include:

Orientation,  position,  shape, topology,  conceptual  neighbourhoods,
spatial processes and event,  qualitative representations of  size and
distance, applications    of  spatial and   spatio-temporal reasoning,
cognitive  and   psychological  aspects,   integration/comparison   of
existing formalisms.


Researchers wishing to present  papers at  the workshop should  submit
three copies of an extended abstract to the  address below by February
14th, 1994.   Abstracts should be a maximum  of 5 A4 pages  in length,
excluding title page and references, and should either describe recent
research work or   survey/contrast past  approaches.  The title   page
should clearly state the author name(s), contact address(es) and email
address(es).   Authors will be  notified of acceptance or rejection by
4th March.

Anyone  wishing to  attend the   workshop without  presenting  a paper
should submit a position  statement (maximum of 2  A4 pages in length)
detailing relevant   research interests. These should  be  sent to the
address below by February 14th 1994.

Workshop title: Computational models of cognition and cognitive functions.

Organisers: Simon Grant, Richard Cooper.

Monday 11th April.

Abstract:
The workshop will address two major issues. We hope firstly to
survey the variety of symbolic cognitive models currently under development,
and secondly to consider the methodological issues raised by the construction
of such models within cognitive science.

We will welcome submissions concerning computational models of cognition in
complex tasks, in learning, in rich everyday activities, and in phenomena from
clinical psychology. The workshop will focus on the study of architectures
that are well-adapted to these areas, and in the methodology surrounding the
construction of related models; including computational support for model
construction.

The emphasis is on models with a high degree of cognitive plausibility. Models
of aspects of cognition are of interest but their role in complete systems
should be addressed. Ideally, models should be related to real-world data
(rather than simply that from the psychological laboratory).

Required background:
Participants should be familiar with the enterprise of symbolic modelling and
the concepts involved. Ideally they should have some practical experience with
the construction and validation of such models. A basic familiarity with
PROLOG may be assumed by presenters.

Discussion papers:
In the first instance, send an abstract (email strongly preferred) of
100 to 300 words to the organisers, by 21st January 1994.  They will
select those that seem to have most synergy, and will invite
submission of full draft discussion papers to those abstracts, by a
deadline to be decided.  The papers will be accepted for presentation
on the basis of the full draft.  Presenters will each be allocated
one half hour in total, of which they are expected to use between 10
and 20 minutes in presentation.

Non-presenters will be welcomed on the basis of how much they are likely
to give to or take from the workshop.  Please submit a short statement
of research interest, noting any relevant publications.

                            12th April 1994


       Practical Introduction to the Soar Cognitive Architecture

             AI Group                    Medical Research Council
     Department of Psychology            Applied Psychology Unit
     University of Nottingham                   Cambridge


This ONE DAY tutorial will cover the fundamentals of the Soar
architecture.  Soar is a cognitive architecture built around multiple
problem spaces for representing knowledge and implemented as a
production system.  It includes a simple built-in learning mechanism
called chunking.  Soar has been proposed by Allen Newell as a
candidate "unified theory of cognition".  It has been used to model
behavior in natural language processing, planning, HCI, abductive
reasoning, and various laboratory tasks.  The tutorial will be of
interest to cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, and
possibly AI researchers, though the emphasis will be on the cognitive
implications of Soar rather than its AI and Knowledge Engineering
applications.  The tutorial will be based on a mixture of lectures
and practical exercises requiring students to run and modify Soar
models.  There will also be opportunities to discuss the psychological
implications of Soar and other topics of interest to the audience.


Topics to be covered include: Overview of the theory; Getting started;
  Default behavior; Viewing the state of a running model;
  Adding knowledge to the model; Learning an operator control chunk;
  The decision procedure; What does Soar buy you?;  Where to go next?

Suggested background reading:
  It will help if those attending the tutorial know something about the
use of production systems as cognitive models, and have at least a passing
acquaintance with the book by Allen Newell, "Unified Theories of Cognition"
(Harvard University Press, 1990).  A short but useful overview of Soar is
provided in two articles by Mitch Waldrop, both in "Science", volume 241,
1988: "Toward a unified theory of cognition", pp.27-29; and "Soar:
A unified theory of cognition?", pp.296-298.

TUTORIAL TITLE:	Computing and cognition as information compression

ORGANISER:	Dr J G Wolff

DATE:		Monday 11th April, morning.

ABSTRACT: This tutorial develops the idea that, in many aspects, the storage and
processing of information in computers and in brains may usefully be
understood as information compression. This idea is the
basis of current research aiming to develop a 'new generation'
computing system which integrates AI functions.

The tutorial will briefly review the history of research in this area.
It will then examine what is meant by information and,
in particular, what is meant by redundancy, a concept
which is fundamental in all methods for information compression.
Principles of information compression will be described.

Most of the tutorial will describe how these principles may be seen in
varied aspects of computing and cognition: the phenomena of adaptation
and inhibition in nervous systems; `neural' computing; the creation and
recognition of `objects' and `classes' in perception and cognition;
stereoscopic vision and random-dot stereograms; the organisation of
natural languages; the organisation of grammars; grammar discovery and
language learning; the organisation of functional, structured, logic
and object-oriented computer programs; the discovery and execution of
`functions'; the application and de-referencing of identifiers in
computing; retrieval of information from databases; access and
retrieval of information from computer memory; logical deduction and
resolution theorem proving; inductive reasoning and probabilistic
inference; parsing; normalisation of databases.

The `SP' system, which is dedicated to information compression by
pattern matching, unification and search, will be described with
examples of what current prototypes can do.

The wider significance of information compression in computing and
cognition will be considered briefly.

TOPICS TO BE COVERED INCLUDE:
Information, redundancy and information compression;
concepts and observations in computing and cognition which may understood as
information compression; the SP system; the significance of informatio
compression.

REQUIRED BACKGROUND:
Attendees should have some experience of computer programming.
Some background in AI, cognitive science, computing or related areas would
be useful.

REASONS FOR ATTENDING: There are two main motives for work in this area:
	* Simplification and integration of concepts in computing and
	 cognition.
	* Development of 'new generation' computing systems with
	 more flexibility and 'intelligence' than conventional computers.

Many postgraduate students become academically isolated as a result of
working in specialised domains within fairly small departments. This
workshop is aimed at providing a forum for graduate students in AI,
Cognitive Science and any aspect of the Simulation of Behaviour to
present and discuss their ideas with other students in related areas.
