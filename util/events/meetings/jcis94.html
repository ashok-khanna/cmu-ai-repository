single-spaced text, (1 page minimum) with figures and tables included. Any
summary exceeding 4 pages will be charged $100 per additional page. Three
copies of the summary are required by July 30, 1994. It is very important
to mark "plan A" or "plan B" on your manuscript. The conference will make
the choice for you if you forget to do so. Final version of the full length
paper must be submitted by November 14, 1994. Four (4) copies of the full
length paper shall be prepared according to the "Information for Authors"

Journal (Elsevier Publishing Co.). A full paper shall not exceed 20 pages
including figures and tables. All full papers will be reviewed by experts
in their respective fields. Revised papers will be due on April 15, 1995.
Accepted papers will appear in the hard-covered proceeding (book) with
uniform typesetting to be published by a publisher (there will be two books
published this year, one for each plan) or Information Sciences Journal
