                  Conference Announcement and
                     First Call for Papers


           International Conference on Intelligent
                      Autonomous  Systems:
                             IAS-4

          Karlsruhe, Germany, March 27 through 30, 1995

After three successful meetings in Amsterdam (1986 and 1989) and in
Pittsburgh (1993) the next IAS Conference will take place in the renowned
city of Karlsruhe situated at the northern tip of Germany's Black Forest.
The purpose of the fourth IAS Conference is to provide an opportunity for
the international community of researchers in the field of autonomous systems
to discuss the state of the art and future directions of complex autonomous
systems as well as architectures, tools, components, and new techniques. The
emphasis will be on realized systems, their applications, and the building of
components and tools to configure and implement autonomous systems.

TOPICS:

The topics will include all aspects of intelligent autonomous systems
(terrestrial, underwater and space), such as:
Smart Sensors	                Mobile Robots
Walking Machines	        Neural Networks
Image Understanding	        Intelligent Control
System Design Tools	        Planning and Control Architectures
Integrated Factory Automation	New Applications

LOCATION:

Karlsruhe has many convenient train and road connections from all over
Germany, France and Switzerland. International flights to Frankfurt (1.5 h),
Stuttgart (1 h), or to Strassbourgh (45 min) would be suitable. Hotel
accomodation will be organized by the local organisation committee.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS:

Four copies of extended abstracts (double spaced, not exceeding four pages)
must be received by the conference secretariat before July 30, 1994 to be
considered. Notification of acceptance will be sent to the authors by
September 30, 1994, and the full camera-ready paper must be returned by
December 10, 1994.
