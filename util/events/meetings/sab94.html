             Conference Announcement and Call For Papers

                      FROM ANIMALS TO ANIMATS

 Third International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB94)


                  Brighton, UK, August 8-12, 1994


        The object of the conference is to bring together researchers in
        ethology, psychology, ecology, cybernetics, artificial intelligence,
        robotics, and related fields so as to further our understanding of
        the behaviors and underlying mechanisms that allow animals and,
        potentially, robots to adapt and survive in uncertain environments.

        The conference will focus particularly on well-defined models,
        computer simulations, and built robots in order to help characterize
        and compare various organizational principles or architectures
        capable of inducing adaptive behavior in real or artificial animals.

        Contributions treating any of the following topics from the
        perspective of adaptive behavior will receive special emphasis.


   Individual and collective behavior   Autonomous robots
   Neural correlates of behavior        Hierarchical and parallel organizations
   Perception and motor control         Emergent structures and behaviors
   Motivation and emotion               Problem solving and planning
   Action selection and behavioral      Goal directed behavior
    sequences                           Neural networks and evolutionary
   Ontogeny, learning and evolution      computation
   Internal world models                Characterization of environments
    and cognitive processes             Applied adaptive behavior



       Authors should make every effort to suggest implications of their
       work for both natural and artificial animals.  Papers which do not
       deal explicitly with adaptive behavior will be rejected.



Submission Instructions

  Authors are requested to send five copies (hard copy only) of a full paper
  to the Program Chair (Dave Cliff). Papers should not exceed 10 pages
  (excluding the title page), with 1 inch margins all around, and no smaller
  than 10 pt (12 pitch) type (Times Roman preferred).
  Each paper must include a title page containing the following: (1) Full
  names, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses (if available),
  and fax numbers for each author, (2) A 100-200 word abstract, (3) The
  topic area(s) in which the paper could be reviewed (see list above).
  Camera ready versions of the papers, in two-column format,  will be
  required after acceptance.  Computer, video, and robotic demonstrations
  are also invited.  Please contact Phil Husbands to make arrangements for
  demonstrations.  Other program proposals will also be considered.

Conference Information

  The conference will be held in the centre of Brighton, on the South Coast.
  This is a resort town, less than one hour from London, only 30 mins from
  London Gatwick airport. A number of invited speakers will be giving tutorial
  talks in  subject areas covered by the conference. Through sponsorship,
  conference fees will be kept to a minimum and there should also be some
  travel grants available. We have made arrangements for the Proceedings to
  be available at the conference, which requires efficient processing of
  submitted papers; hence if possible first submissions should be made using
  LaTex template available by email.

Email Information

  Email sab94@cogs.susx.ac.uk with subject line "Subscribe mail-list"
  to be put on our mailing list and be sent further information about
  conference arrangements when available.
  Email sab94@cogs.susx.ac.uk with subject line "LaTex template"
  to be sent LaTex template for camera-ready and for initial submissions.
