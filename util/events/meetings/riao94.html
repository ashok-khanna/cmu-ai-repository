 MESSAGE TO THE PARTICIPANTS OF RIAO94

The explosion of computer processing power, memories and networks, 
along with the intense activity of the United States in this domain, 
makes the holding of "RIAO94" in New York City an event full of 
promise for valuable exchanges of scientific information and 
stimulating demonstrations.

Rockefeller University is happy to follow M.I.T., which welcomed 
Conference "RIAO 1988", and Barcelona in Spain, which did the same 
in 1991.

Rockefeller University is deeply involved in biomedical  research, 
interelating biochemistry with clinical medecine. Its importance in 
the field of medicine is indicated by the fact that its staff has 
received 19 Nobel Prizes since its foundation in 1901.


We are confident that your active participation in the conference 
will contribute much to its success.

Dr. F. Seitz
President Emeritus
Rockefeller University

PRESENTATION OF PRODUCTS

The RIAO94 conference is being held as electronic information processing is 
undergoing a profound revolution. At work or at home, digital access 
to electronic information is finally becoming a mass phenomenon.

Until now , only a relatively restricted number of people, 
researchers mostly, have had access to a limited number of data 
bases. Today, not only the quantity of information but its diversity 
have become factors that everyone must deal with. Data is becoming 
more available but it is scattered over
vast heterogeneous technical and social  networks which are
managed in a distributed fashion with varied methods and 
aims. The information seeker is confronted with new challenges, and 
must develop new work habits as he or she directly tracks the 
possibilities of multishaped, large and evolving databases.

In this light, RIAO has adopted a different approach and a different 
presentation of product demonstrations. Horizontal application areas 
giving a wide view of full applications within a domain will be 
presented in conjunction with vertical enabling technologies that 
may be applied to any domain.

In order to develop this new approach more fully we have
extended the period for accepting  
new demonstration participants until September 1.

Three main horizontal sectors have been selected as demonstration 
areas: Medicine, Space and Art.

MEDICINE

As Health Care Reforms are being initiated in Europe and in the US, 
much attention is being given to the future role of medical 
computing and telecommunications. At RIAO 94 recent developments 
relating to the Electronic Health Record of the future will be 
demonstrated.

Some of the applications and themes presented:

"The Visible Human " project from the National Library of Medicine.

Tools for identifying shapes in medical images, extracting 
information dynamically from sequences of 2D images (MIT Multimedia 
Lab).

Telemedicine with demonstrations from Europe via the World Wide Web.

Also electronic data interchange through standardized messages, 
communication of medical images, the ultimate medical workstation.

SPACE

Space and aeronautic technologies have created large quantities of 
image data and vast stores of technical documentation. Information 
solutions in these areas will be demonstrated via applications such 
as:

Spot Images'database of 3.5 million satellite photos, enriched at a 
rate of 2,000 images a day.

Jouve will present a demonstration of its European-American 
application using CALS and SGML in technical documentation and their 
impact on searching for information.

ART

Virtual museum projects are numerous all over the world, as methods 
are being explored to produce Art databases, interfaces and research 
engines. Some applications to be presented:

The NARCISSE project in the IMPACT program: Network of Art Research 
and Computer Image Systems in Europe.

The RAMA project in the European Race program : Remote Access to 
Museum Archives.

The San Francisco Museum of Art has recently developed a product 
entitled American Visions : 

OTHER SECTORS

Demonstrations of new and innovative functions in the fields of 
Libraries and Legal Fields will also be shown.

A demonstration will be given on the Tax Documentation Service  
containing  legislation, interpretation and case law related to the 
Italian Taxation Domain, daily accessed by a very large number of 
users at all relevant Public Administration sites in Italy through a 
large private network and duly updated by means of an internal text 
acquisition and indexing process. Relevant functionalities such as 
query expansion/restriction and textual navigation as well as usage of 
specific dictionaries will be shown.


ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES

As well as the presentation of the above horizontal application 
fields, vertical axes of enabling technologies will also be 
presented at RIAO94.

Some of the best advanced products in the following fields will be 
present in the Product Demonstration section of RIAO94. A sample 
from each field is given.

Information Retrieval: with demonstrations by pathsetters such as 
Fulcrum, Claritech...

Software tools : Xerox Linguistic Tools; SGML information 
structuring tools; and other information management software.

Networks Services:  GROUPLENS news filtering from MIT and University 
of Minnesota, and others

CD-ROM: SGML television dictionaries; from Italy, the Media Music 
system of navigation in a musical database.

Interfaces: group requests; navigational assistance; intelligent 
agents.

The Organizers of RIAO94 are still communicating with a number of 
further applications and product developers who will be present at 
the conference.

The final list of the demonstrations will be available on September 
10, 1994 and will be mailed on request and sent to participants who 
have mailed their registration form.
