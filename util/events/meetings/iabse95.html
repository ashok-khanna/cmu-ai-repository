Introduction

Every  civil engineer now agrees that the use of  computers
in  practice and in research will increase steadily in  the
foreseeable  future. This trend presents both opportunities
and  risks.  As more and more information is  processed  by
computers,  civil  engineers  need  effective   tools   for
interacting with this information and for supporting  their
knowledge.
Activities   related  to  the  exploitation  of  artificial
intelligence results within the field of civil  engineering
are  increasing. Indeed, some knowledge-based  systems  are
already  in  use. The development of a good application  is
difficult; it requires careful modelling, flexible  methods
and    understandable   interfaces.   Nevertheless,    such
development is essential for demonstrating the potential of
advanced   computer  technology.  Furthermore,  experiences
gained from good applications stimulate subsequent research
activities.
New  approaches  which  are relevant to  civil  engineering
tasks   are   emerging  from  fields  such  as  qualitative
modelling,    machine   learning,   case-based   reasoning,
computational modelling of creative design, neural networks
and  non-monotonic logic. Demonstrating the  usefulness  of
such  approaches provides a framework for applications that
will  be implemented in the next decade. Many methods  show
great  potential  for  supporting the  knowledge  of  civil
engineers.

Objectives

The  principal  objective of this Colloquium  is  to  bring
together   researchers  and  practitioners  from  industry,
universities, professional practice and research centres in
order  to  exchange  views on knowledge support  for  civil
engineers.  Also, this meeting will increase  understanding
of  the  importance of the relationship between  artificial
intelligence and civil engineering research and practice. A
special  emphasis  will be placed on user's  assessment  of
implemented knowledge support systems and their penetration
into practice. It is expected that this will lead to higher
quality  research  and  better implementations  of  current
technology.

Participants

The  Colloquium  is  intended  for  a  limited  number   of
participants.  Consulting  engineers,  those  in  industry,
researchers and educators are welcome to submit  papers  on
themes mentioned in the summary of the technical programme.
Those  who do not wish to present a paper are very  welcome
to attend and participate in the discussions.

Technical Programme

The technical programme will offer four plenary sessions:

    1.  Knowledge support for structural design and
        construction
    2.  Applications related to evaluation, repair and
        monitoring
    3.  Standards processing, code-related support and
        applications in non structural areas of civil
        engineering
    4.  Artificial intelligence technology in civil
        engineering

as well as a Panel Discussion.

Session 1:      Knowledge support for structural design and
                construction

Structural  design  and  construction  activities   include
knowledge  intensive  tasks  that  are  carried  out  under
conditions  of  incomplete  and contradictory  information.
Much  knowledge  has never been formalised. Structures  are
difficult  to  model and decision making processes  do  not
correspond to traditional inference technology.

This  session  will  include  papers  on  topics  such   as
intelligent    design    systems,    case-based     design,
collaborative design, estimating, construction  engineering
and management.

Session 2:      Applications related to evaluation,  repair
                and monitoring

This  session  deals  with the applications  of  artificial
intelligence research to managing structures in service. As
the  inventory  of structures ages and as  fewer  resources
exist to replace them, the need for performant systems  for
structural  management  is increasing  in  many  countries.
Topics  are  evaluation of structures  (damage  assessment,
rating and risk analysis), structural repair and monitoring
of structures.

Session  3:     Standards processing,  code-related support
                and  application  in  non structural  areas
                of civil engineering

This   session  will  include  developments  in   standards
processing, applications linked to codes and research  work
in  other areas, such as in situ and laboratory testing  of
soils   and   rocks,   hydrogeological  and   environmental
engineering.

Session 4:      Artificial intelligence technology in civil
                engineering

The  session covers issues related to interactions  between
artificial intelligence and needs for knowledge support  in
civil engineering. The following topics are significant:
    - modelling different types of knowledge
    - non-monotonic reasoning
    - integration of several reasoning methods
    - combination of knowledge systems with other  software
      technologies
    - machine learning
    - neural networks.
Creation  of  systems that include artificial  intelligence
technology   requires  special  attention  to   development
processes,  methods and tools. Use of modern techniques  in
software engineering is essential. The following topics  in
this   field  may  be  considered:  knowledge  elicitation,
modelling    techniques   and   related   support    tools,
requirements  analysis, life cycle  of  knowledge  systems,
project   management,  validation  and   quality   control,
maintenance and evolution.

Panel discussion:

The impact of artificial intelligence on civil engineering:
current and future prospects.
