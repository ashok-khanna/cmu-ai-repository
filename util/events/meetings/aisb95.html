            CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

                  AISB-95:  Hybrid Problems, Hybrid Solutions.
                  ============================================

                      Monday 3rd -- Friday 7th April 1995

            Halifax Hall of Residence & Computer Science Department
                            University of Sheffield
                               Sheffield, ENGLAND

           The Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science
       organised by the Society for the Study of Artificial intelligence
                          and Simulation of Behaviour

Programme Chair:     John Hallam (University of Edinburgh)

Programme Committee: Dave Cliff (University of Sussex)
                     Erik Sandewall (University of Linkoeping)
                     Nigel Shadbolt (University of Nottingham)
                     Sam Steel (University of Essex)
                     Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield)

Local Organisation:  Paul McKevitt (University of Sheffield)

The past few years have seen  an  increasing  tendency  for  diversification 
in
research into Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Artificial Life. 
A
number of approaches are being pursued, based variously on  symbolic 
reasoning,
connectionist  systems  and  models,  behaviour-based  systems,  and  ideas
from
complex  dynamical  systems.   Each  has  its   own   particular   insight  
and
philosophical position.

This variety of approaches appears in  all  areas  of  Artificial 
Intelligence.
There  are  both  symbolic  and  connectionist natural language processing,
both
classical and behaviour-based vision research, for instance.

While purists from each approach may claim that all the  problems  of 
cognition
can  in principle be tackled without recourse to other methods, in practice
(and
maybe in theory, also) combinations of methods  from  the  different 
approaches
(hybrid  methods)  are more successful than a pure approach for certain kinds
of
problems.  The committee feels that there is an unrealised synergy  between 
the
various approaches that an AISB conference may be able to explore.

Thus, the focus of the tenth AISB Conference is  on  such  hybrid  methods.  
We
particularly  seek  papers  that  describe novel theoretical and/or
experimental
work which uses a hybrid approach or papers from purists, arguing cogently 
that
compromise  is  unnecessary  or  unproductive.   While  papers such as those
are
particularly sought, good papers on any topic in Artificial Intelligence will
be
considered:   as  always,  the  most  important  criteria for acceptance will
be
soundness, originality, substance and clarity.  Research in all areas is
equally
welcome.

The AISB conference is a single track conference lasting three days, with a 
two
day  tutorial  and  workshop  programme  preceding the main technical event,
and
around twenty high calibre papers will be presented in the  technical 
sessions.
(A  separate  call  for  workshops and tutorial participation will appear in
due
course.) It is expected that the proceedings of the conference will be
published
in book form in time to be available at the conference itself, making it a
forum
for rapid dissemination of research results.

SUBMISSIONS:

High quality original papers dealing with the issues raised by mixing 
different
approaches,  or otherwise related to the Conference Theme, should be sent to
the
Programme Chair.  Papers  which  give  comparative  experimental  evaluation 
of
methods  from  different  paradigms  applied  to  the same problem, papers
which
propose and evaluate mixed-paradigm theoretical models or tools, and papers
that
focus  on  hybrid  systems  applied  to real world problems will be
particularly
welcome, as will papers from purists who argue cogently that the hybrid
approach
is flawed and a particular pure approach is to be preferred.

Papers being submitted, whether verbatim or in  essence,  to  other 
conferences
whose review process runs concurrently with AISB-95 should indicate this fact
on
their title page.  If a submitted paper appears at another conference it must
be
withdrawn  from  AISB-95  (this  does  not  apply  to presentation at
specialist
workshops).  Papers that violate these  requirements  may  be  rejected 
without
review.

SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield is one of the friendliest cities in the UK and is situated well
having
the  best  and  closest surrounding countryside of any major city in the UK.
The
Peak District National Park is only minutes away. It is a good city for
walkers,
runners,  and climbers.  It has two theatres, three 10 screen cinemas, a
library
theatre which shows more artistic films, a large number of museums many of
which
demonstrate  Sheffield's industrial past, and a number of Galleries in the
City,
including the Mapping Gallery and Ruskin. Several important ancient houses,
such
as Chatsworth House, are close to Sheffield.  The Peak District National Park
is
a beautiful site for visiting and rambling upon.  There are large shopping
areas
in the City and by 1995 Sheffield will be served by a 'supertram' system.

The University of Sheffield's Halls of Residence are  situated  on  the 
western
side of the city in a leafy residential area described by John Betjeman as
``the
prettiest suburb in England''.  Halifax Hall is centred on a local Steel
Baron's
house,  dating back to 1830 and set in extensive grounds. It was acquired by
the
University in 1830 and converted into a Hall of Residence  for  women  with 
the
addition of a new wing.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield Computer Science  Department  has  a  strong  programme  in 
Cognitive
Systems  and  is  part  of  the  University's Institute for Language, Speech
and
Hearing (ILASH).  ILASH has its own machines and  support  staff,  and 
academic
staff  attached to it from nine departments. Sheffield Psychology Department
has
the Artificial Intelligence Vision Research Unit (AIVRU) which  was  founded 
in
1984 to coordinate a large industry/university Alvey research consortium
working
on the development of computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles and 
robot
workstations.

FORMAT AND DEADLINES:

Four copies of submitted papers must be received by the Programme Chair no
later
than  24  OCTOBER  1994  to be considered.  Papers should be at most 12 pages
in
length and be produced in 12 point, with at most 60 lines of text  per  A4 
page
and  margins  at  least  1 inch (2.5cm) wide on all sides (default LaTeX
article
style is OK).  They should include a cover sheet (not counted  in  the  12 
page
limit) giving the paper title, the abstract, the authors and their
affiliations,
including a contact address for both electronic and paper mail for the
principal
author.   Papers  should  be submitted in hard-copy, not electronically. 
Papers
that do not adhere to this format specification may be rejected without
review.

Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by 7 DECEMBER 1994  and 
full
camera-ready  copy  will  be  due  in  early JANUARY 1995 (publishers'
deadlines
permitting).

        AISB-95: CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
        -------------------------------------------------

             Call for Workshop Proposals: AISB-95

                 University of Sheffield,
                    Sheffield, England

                    April 3 -- 4, 1995

                   Society for the Study of
      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


The AISB Committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction
with the Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science (AISB-95).
While the main conference will run for three days from Wednesday, April 5 to
Friday, April 7, the workshops will be held on the two days preceding the main
event: Monday, April 3 and Tuesday, April 4.

The main conference has the theme "Hybrid Problems, Hybrid Solutions" (see the
main conference call) and while proposals for workshops related to that theme
would be particularly welcome, proposals are invited for workshops relating
to any aspect of Artificial Intelligence or the Simulation of Behaviour.

Proposals, from an individual or a pair of organisers, for workshops between
0.5 and 2 days long will be considered. Workshops will probably address topics
which are at the forefront of research, but not yet sufficiently developed to
warrant a full-scale conference.

 Submission:
 ----------
 A workshop proposal should contain the following information:

 1. Workshop Title

 2. A detailed outline of the workshop.
    This should include the necessary background and the potential
    target audience for the workshop and a justified estimate of the
    number of possible attendees. Please also state the length and
    preferred date(s) of the workshop. Specify any equipment requirements,
    indicating whether the organisers would be expected to meet them.

 3. A brief resume of the organiser(s).
    This should include: background in the research area,
    references to published work in the topic area and relevant
    experience, such as previous organisation or chairing of
    workshops.

 4. Administrative information.
    This should include: name, mailing address, phone number, fax, and
    email address if available.  In the case of multiple organisers,
    information for each organiser should be provided, but one organiser
    should be identified as the principal contact.

 5. A draft Call for Participation.
    This should serve the dual purposes of informing and attracting
    potential participants.


 The organisers of accepted workshops are responsible for issuing a call for
 participation, reviewing requests to participate and scheduling the workshop
 activities within the constraints set by the Workshop Organiser. They are
 also responsible for submitting a collated set of papers for their workshop
 to the Workshop Organiser.

 Dates:
 ------
 Intentions to organise a workshop should be made known to the
 Workshop Organiser as soon as possible.

 Proposals must be received by October 18th 1994.
 Decisions about topics and speakers will be made in early November.
 Collated sets of papers to be received by March 15th 1995.

 Proposals should be sent to:

    Dr. Robert Gaizauskas
    Department of Computer Science
    University of Sheffield
    211 Portobello Street
    Regent Court
    Sheffield S1 4DP
    U.K.

    email:  robertg@dcs.shef.ac.uk
    phone:  +44 (0)742 825572
    fax:    +44 (0)742 780972

Electronic submission (plain ascii text) is highly preferred, but
hard copy submission is also accepted, in which case 5 copies should
be submitted. Proposals should not exceed 2 sides of A4 (i.e. 120
lines of text approx.).

      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


The AISB Committee invites proposals for Tutorials to be held in conjunction
with the Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science (AISB-95).
While the main conference will run for three days from Wednesday, April 5 to
Friday, April 7, the tutorials will be held on the two days preceding the main
event: Monday, April 3 and Tuesday, April 4.

Proposals for full and half day tutorials, from an individual or pair of
presenters, will be considered. They may be offered both on standard topics
and on new and more advanced aspects of Artificial Intelligence or Simulation
of Behaviour. Anyone interested in presenting a tutorial should submit a
proposal to the Workshop Organiser Dr Robert Gaizauskas (addresses below).

 Submission:
 ----------
 A tutorial proposal should contain the following
 information:

 1. Tutorial Title

 2. A brief description of the tutorial, suitable for inclusion in
    a brochure.

 3. A detailed outline of the tutorial.
    This should include the necessary background and the potential
    target audience for the tutorial and a justified estimate of the
    number of possible attendees. Please also state the length and
    preferred date(s) of the tutorial. Specify any equipment requirements,
    indicating whether the organisers would be expected to meet them.

 4. A brief resume of the presenter(s).
    This should include: background in the tutorial area,
    references to published work in the topic area and relevant
    experience. Published work should, ideally, include a published
    tutorial-level article on the subject. Relevant experience
    is teaching experience, including previous conference tutorials
    or short courses presented.

 5. Administrative information.
    This should include: name, mailing address, phone number, fax, and
    email address if available.  In the case of multiple presenters,
    information for each presenter should be provided, but one presenter
    should be identified as the principal contact.

 The presenter(s) of accepted tutorials must submit a set of
 tutorial notes (which may include relevant tutorial-level
 publications) to the Workshop Organisers by March 15th 1995.

        AISB-95: CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND TUTORIAL PROPOSALS
        -------------------------------------------------

             Call for Workshop Proposals: AISB-95

                 University of Sheffield,
                    Sheffield, England

                    April 3 -- 4, 1995

                   Society for the Study of
      Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (SSAISB)


The AISB Committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction
with the Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science (AISB-95).
While the main conference will run for three days from Wednesday, April 5 to
Friday, April 7, the workshops will be held on the two days preceding the main
event: Monday, April 3 and Tuesday, April 4.

The main conference has the theme "Hybrid Problems, Hybrid Solutions" (see the
main conference call) and while proposals for workshops related to that theme
would be particularly welcome, proposals are invited for workshops relating
to any aspect of Artificial Intelligence or the Simulation of Behaviour.

Proposals, from an individual or a pair of organisers, for workshops between
0.5 and 2 days long will be considered. Workshops will probably address topics
which are at the forefront of research, but not yet sufficiently developed to
warrant a full-scale conference.

 Submission:
 ----------
 A workshop proposal should contain the following information:

 1. Workshop Title

 2. A detailed outline of the workshop.
    This should include the necessary background and the potential
    target audience for the workshop and a justified estimate of the
    number of possible attendees. Please also state the length and
    preferred date(s) of the workshop. Specify any equipment requirements,
    indicating whether the organisers would be expected to meet them.

 3. A brief resume of the organiser(s).
    This should include: background in the research area,
    references to published work in the topic area and relevant
    experience, such as previous organisation or chairing of
    workshops.

 4. Administrative information.
    This should include: name, mailing address, phone number, fax, and
    email address if available.  In the case of multiple organisers,
    information for each organiser should be provided, but one organiser
    should be identified as the principal contact.

 5. A draft Call for Participation.
    This should serve the dual purposes of informing and attracting
    potential participants.


 The organisers of accepted workshops are responsible for issuing a call for
 participation, reviewing requests to participate and scheduling the workshop
 activities within the constraints set by the Workshop Organiser. They are
 also responsible for submitting a collated set of papers for their workshop
 to the Workshop Organiser.

 Dates:
 ------
 Intentions to organise a workshop should be made known to the
 Workshop Organiser as soon as possible.

 Proposals must be received by October 18th 1994.
 Decisions about topics and speakers will be made in early November.
 Collated sets of papers to be received by March 15th 1995.

 Proposals should be sent to:

    Dr. Robert Gaizauskas
    Department of Computer Science
    University of Sheffield
    211 Portobello Street
    Regent Court

            CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT AND PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

                  AISB-95:  Hybrid Problems, Hybrid Solutions.
                  ============================================

                      Monday 3rd -- Friday 7th April 1995

            Halifax Hall of Residence & Computer Science Department
                            University of Sheffield
                               Sheffield, ENGLAND

           The Tenth Biennial Conference on AI and Cognitive Science
       organised by the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence
                        and the Simulation of Behaviour

Programme Chair:     John Hallam (University of Edinburgh)

Programme Committee: Dave Cliff (University of Sussex)
                     Erik Sandewall (University of Linkoeping)
                     Nigel Shadbolt (University of Nottingham)
                     Sam Steel (University of Essex)
                     Yorick Wilks (University of Sheffield)

Local Organisation:  Paul  Mc Kevitt (University of Sheffield)

The past few years have seen  an  increasing  tendency  for  diversification  in
research into Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Artificial Life.  A
number of approaches are being pursued, based variously on  symbolic  reasoning,
connectionist  systems  and  models,  behaviour-based  systems,  and  ideas from
complex  dynamical  systems.   Each  has  its   own   particular   insight   and
philosophical position.

This variety of approaches appears in  all  areas  of  Artificial  Intelligence.
There  are  both  sybmolic  and  connectionist natural language processing, both
classical and behaviour-based vision research, for instance.

While purists from each approach may claim that all the  problems  of  cognition
can  in principle be tackled without recourse to other methods, in practice (and
maybe in theory, also) combinations of methods  from  the  different  approaches
(hybrid  methods)  are more successful than a pure approach for certain kinds of
problems.  The committee feels that there is an unrealised synergy  between  the
various approaches that an AISB conference may be able to explore.

Thus, the focus of the tenth AISB Conference is  on  such  hybrid  methods.   We
particularly  seek  papers  that  describe novel theoretical and/or experimental
work which uses a hybrid approach or papers from purists, arguing cogently  that
compromise  is  unnecessary  or  unproductive.   While  papers such as those are
particularly sought, good papers on any topic in Artificial Intelligence will be
considered:   as  always,  the  most  important  criteria for acceptance will be
soundness, originality, substance and clarity.  Research in all areas is equally
welcome.

The AISB conference is a single track conference lasting three days, with a  two
day  tutorial  and  workshop  programme  preceding the main technical event, and
around twenty high calibre papers will be presented in the  technical  sessions.
It  is expected that the proceedings of the conference will be published in book
form in time to be available at the conference itself, making  it  a  forum  for
rapid dissemination of research results.


SUBMISSIONS:

High quality original papers dealing with the issues raised by mixing  different
approaches,  or otherwise related to the Conference Theme, should be sent to the
Programme Chair.  Papers  which  give  comparative  experimental  evaluation  of
methods  from  different  paradigms  applied  to  the same problem, papers which
propose and evaluate mixed-paradigm theoretical models or tools, and papers that
focus  on  hybrid  systems  applied  to real world problems will be particularly
welcome, as will papers from purists who argue cogently that the hybrid approach
is flawed and a particular pure approach is to be preferred.

Papers being submitted, whether verbatim or in  essence,  to  other  conferences
whose review process runs concurrently with AISB-95 should indicate this fact on
their title page.  If a submitted paper appears at another conference it must be
withdrawn  from  AISB-95  (this  does  not  apply  to presentation at specialist
workshops).  Papers that violate these  requirements  may  be  rejected  without
review.


SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield is one of the friendliest cities in the UK and is situated well having
the  best  and  closest surrounding countryside of any major city in the UK. The
Peak District National Park is only minutes away. It is a good city for walkers,
runners,  and  climbers.   It  has  two  theatres,  the Crucible and Lyceum. The
Lyceum, a beautiful Victorian theatre, has recently been renovated.   Also,  the
city  has  three 10 screen cinemas.  There is a library theatre which shows more
artistic films. The city has a large number of museums many of which demonstrate
Sheffield's  industrial  past,  and there are a number of Galleries in the City,
including the Mapping Gallery and Ruskin.  A number of important ancient  houses
are close to Sheffield such as Chatsworth House. The Peak District National Park
is a beautiful site for visiting and rambling upon.  There  are  large  shopping
areas  in the City and by 1995 Sheffield will be served by a 'supertram' system:
the line to the Meadowhall shopping and leisure complex is already open.

The University of Sheffield's Halls of Residence are  situated  on  the  western
side of the city in a leafy residential area described by John Betjeman as ``the
prettiest suburb in England''.  Halifax Hall is centred on a local Steel Baron's
house,  dating back to 1830 and set in extensive grounds. It was acquired by the
University in 1830 and converted into a Hall of Residence  for  women  with  the
addition of a new wing.


ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT SHEFFIELD:

Sheffield Computer Science  Department  has  a  strong  programme  in  Cognitive
Systems  and  is  part  of  the  University's Institute for Language, Speech and
Hearing (ILASH).  ILASH has its own machines and  support  staff,  and  academic
staff  attached to it from nine departments. Sheffield Psychology Department has
the Artificial Intelligence Vision Research Unit (AIVRU) which  was  founded  in
1984 to coordinate a large industry/university Alvey research consortium working
on the development of computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles and  robot
workstations.


FORMAT AND DEADLINES:

Four copies of submitted papers must be received by the Programme Chair no later
than  24  OCTOBER  1994  to be considered.  Papers should be at most 12 pages in
length and be produced in 12 point, with at most 60 lines of text  per  A4  page
and  margins  at  least  1 inch (2.5cm) wide on all sides (default LaTeX article
style is OK).  They should include a cover sheet (not counted  in  the  12  page
limit) giving the paper title, the abstract, the authors and their affiliations,
including a contact address for both electronic and paper mail for the principal
author.   Papers  should  be submitted in hard-copy, not electronically.  Papers
that do not adhere to this format specification may be rejected without review.

Notification of acceptance will be sent to authors by 7 DECEMBER 1994  and  full
camera-ready  copy  will  be  due  in  early JANUARY 1995 (publishers' deadlines
permitting).
