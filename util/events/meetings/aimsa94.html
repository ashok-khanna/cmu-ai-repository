											6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence :
                      Methodology, Systems, Applications

                    Sofia, Bulgaria, September 21-24, 1994

 
                    --------------------------------------

Since the first  AIMSA in 1984, the AIMSA conferences take place in 
Bulgaria. 
They are biennial forums for presentation of AI research and development,
with
a now well established tradition of international  scientific exchange
between 
Central and Oriental Europe and the rest of the world.


AIMSA'94 is sponsored by ECCAI, European Coordinating Committee for
Artificial 
Intelligence


AIMSA'94 will be  preceeded by a Summer School on AI organized by Tempus
Joint 
European Project 1728, with the support of Tempus Joint European Project
1497.

                    ---------------------------------------


Topics of interest
------------------
	•	Automated reasoning : theorem proving, reasoning about action and
change, 
		 reasoning  about time  and space, constraint satisfaction, reasoning on 
		 uncertainty and with fuzzy sets, analogy and induction, machine
learning.
	•	Logics for AI : logics for knowledge, belief and intention, multi-valued

   logics, modal and temporal logics, epistemic logics, fuzzy logics.
	•	Languages, structures and algorithms for AI : logic programming,
inductive 
	 	logic programming, constraint programming, multi-agent systems,
		 connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, parallel processing for AI.
	•	Knowledge-based systems : languages and systems for representing
	 	knowledge, object-based knowledge representation systems, knowledge 
	 	acquisition, validation of knowledge-based systems.
	•	Natural language processing : syntax, semantics, discourse, speech
	 	recognition and understanding, natural language generation, natural
		 language front ends.
	•	Perception and action : computer vision, object recognition, stereo
vision, 
	 	active vision, robotics systems, robot progamming, robot motion
	 	planning, mobile robotics, behavior-based reactive robots.
	•	Principles of AI applications : AI for decision systems, AI in
education, AI 
   in engineering design, AI in manufacturing control, AI in medicine, AI
in
	 	molecular biology, AI in environmental sciences.

Format of papers
----------------
Papers should be written in English and be printed on one side of A4 paper,
no 
more than 50 lines per page, 3cm margins and 12 point type. Minimum length
is 
2500 words (about 5 pages single-spaced) and maximum 5000 words (10 pages),

including figures, tables, diagrams. Electronic or fax submissions will not
be 
considered.

Each paper should start with :
	•	Title of the paper (with 18 point type),
	•	Names and institutions of all authors,
	•	Postal and email address of one of the authors (to whom mail from the 
		 program committee will be sent),
	•	An abstract of 100-150 words.

Selection of papers
-------------------
Each paper will be reviewed by several referees. Selection criteria include

accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results,
quality 
of presentation. Authors of accepted papers will be asked to prepare final 
versions for the proceedings and are expected to present their papers at
the
conference.

Best paper award
----------------
The program committee will select one paper of exceptional quality among
the 
accepted papers. The authors will receive the best paper award during the
