  "Enhancing Business and Industry through Intelligent Systems"

The Second Singapore International Conference on Intelligent Systems 
will be held in Singapore on 14-17 November, 1994. The conference is 
intended to provide a forum for presentations of applications of 
intelligent systems with a sectoral focus, as well as research on 
intelligent system  technology that enable such applications. In 
addition to the technical sessions, there will be keynote, invited 
and tutorial sessions, as well as a panel on Intelligent System 
Applications in the Pacific Rim countries.

Papers from all countries are sought in three main tracks:
(1) Present applications of intelligent systems to the solution of 
    problems in business, industry and other areas;
(2) Describe research on intelligent systems technology that enable 
    such applications;
(3) Address issues in the deployment of intelligent systems.

Areas of application include but are not limited to:
agriculture, communications, construction & real estate, education & 
training, financial services, government, healthcare, publishing & 
information services, manufacturing, retail, wholesale & distribution, 
transportation.

Intelligent system technologies include but are not limited to:
knowledge-based systems, neural networks, fuzzy systems, vision, 
robotics, knowledge engineering, multimedia, natural language 
processing, human-computer interfaces, tutoring systems, machine 
learning.

Topics in the deployment of intelligent systems include but are not 
limited to:
justification for intelligent system projects, organizational issues, 
business process reengineering, human resources, integration with 
databases and information systems, knowledge sharing & reuse, knowledge 
acquisition, validation & verification.
