                      8th International Symposium on
                Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology

                           September 27-29, 1993

                        University of New Hampshire
                         Durham, New Hampshire USA

    The Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory of the University of
New Hampshire is sponsoring the 8th International Symposium on Unmanned
Untethered Submersible Technology on September 27, 28 and 29, 1993.  The
Symposium will be held at the New England Center at the University of New
Hampshire.

    The theme of the Symposium is "Application or Research:  The Quest for
Balance."  Emphasis will be placed on the discussion of unmanned untethered
submersible technologies that will provide new insight and understanding in
critical areas such as:

    INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS/TECHNOLOGY      COMMUNICATIONS
    AUTONOMOUS MANIPULATION             MODELING
    UNDERWATER IMAGING                  ENERGY
    SENSOR SYSTEMS/PROCESSING           DISTRIBUTED CONTROL
    GUIDANCE AND CONTROL                HYDRODYNAMICS
    NAVIGATION                          KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES
    RELIABILITY                         KNOWLEDGE UTILIZATION

                       ***** VIDEO SUBMISSIONS *****

    Recent and historical footage of events significant to the development
of unmanned untethered submersibles are welcome.  Video segments
demonstrating results described in the conference proceedings are
particularly appropriate.  

    Video clips from one to five minutes length are suggested.  Abstracts
describing the video should accompany each clip.  Abstracts should not
exceed 100 words, and should also include title and author's name,
organizational affiliation and address.  Inclusion of an additional
abstract copy in electronic form (electronic mail, ASCII or WordPerfect
diskette) is appreciated.  
    Clarity of the video submissions is essential.  Narration is highly
recommended.  Entries should be edited to provide a high quality,
quickly-paced presentation of general interest to conference attendees.  We
can accommodate VHS, Super VHS and 8mm camcorder tape.  Please label
videotape mailer "Magnetic Media Enclosed."  All selected videos will be
compiled onto a single tape, duplicated, and made available at the
conference for a modest fee.  

Submissions to date total approximately one hour.  Additional late
submissions will still be considered.

    Late Submission Deadline:           August 16, 1993  <<<<<<<<< !!!!!!!!
    Notification of Acceptance:         August 20, 1993
