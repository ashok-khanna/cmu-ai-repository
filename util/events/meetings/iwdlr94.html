1. Intentions

The scholarly  and  scientific tradition in lexical research
was given an  engineering edge by three outbursts of massive
lexical work that began in the last decade,  the CYC project
in the United  States,  the EDR  project in Japan,  and  the
Grosseto Workshop whose principle of reusability generated a
series of EC  projects including Acquilex,  ET-7,  Multilex,
and Genelex.  These projects  led to,  and were equalled by,
world wide interest in statistics on very large corpora. The
close inter-relationships between  Lexicon  development  and
Corpus   analysis   are   increasingly   accentuated.   This
international drive on the lexicon over a period of a decade
has done the field an immense service.


However, recent reflections on the lexical research over the
last ten years  are not always as  favourable as  one  might
expect.  Wilks  (1993) made a criticism  of IBM's approach to
Machine  Translation.  The main point was  that  there is  a
natural ceiling of success to PURE statistical methods.  Ide
and Veronis  (1993)  went so far as to ask if we have wasted
our  time over the  last decade on extracting knowledge from
machine-readable dictionaries.

Another  area  of  concern  nowadays  is  the development of
common lexical specifications,  or lexical standards.  Up to
which  level   of  lexical  description   can  standards  be
proposed, to ensure data reusability?

Furthermore,  one important development in  AI and Cognitive
Science in  recent years  warrants  the attention  of lexical
researchers.  It involves the trend  for the  integration of
NLP with various subareas of AI,  e.g. computer vision  (see
Dennett,  1991;  Mc Kevitt,  1994).  The  need  for  unified
representation   scheme   incorporating    both   perceptual
information and common sense knowledge poses new challenges.

The proposed workshop attempts  to clarify issues in current
lexical research  in terms of further research directions as
an answer to  recent  challenges.  Suggested  topics are  as
follows:

a) notes comparing between well-known lexical projects, 
particulary the EDR project, the CYC project, and the EC 
projects --what have we learned ?

b) lexical needs for unified representations of common sense
knowledge  and  perceptual  knowledge,   visual   or   audio
--brainstorming  on  the  design  and  construction  of  the
lexicons for such integrated systems;

c)  lexical needs of very  large knowledge bases for nuclear
lexicons  as   the  core  for   knowledge   acquisition   --
speculations   and   practice  concerning  the   design  and
construction of such nuclei.


2. Format

This workshop is intended as an opportunity provided for the
exchange of views on issues of common concern to the area of
lexical  research.   Panel   sessions  and  discussions  are
stressed rather than formal speeches.  All activities at the
workshop are intended as reactions to recent challenges.

The workshop  will take  place  on  the  beautiful  Tsinghua
University campus on the outskirt of Beijing.

Day  1:  the state-of-the-art  discussion  --  achievements,
issues and concerns
Day 2: lexical needs for integrated systems
Day  3:  lexical needs for knowledge  acquisition  for  very
large knowledge systems

Each  attendee   of   the   workshop  pays   $100  to  cover
registration,  preprints,local  transportation from  and  to
Beijing Airport,  and  hotel + food  expenses for  the 3-day
workshop duration.  Air fare to and from  Beijing rests with
all attendees themselves. 

Registation forms will be sent out to workshop attendees upon
request. All correspondence concerning workshop registration 
should be directed to Chengming Guo by fax, e-mail, or postal 
mail at the Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University,
Beijing, 100084, China. To ensure proper accomodation, special
pre-arrangements have to be made with Chengming Guo, should 
the attendee wish to arrive earlier than August 14th and/or
stay a little longer after the workshop ends on the 17th of 
August.

3. Submission requirements

Papers  of  no  more  than 6  pages  should  be submitted by
e-mail  to  the  co-chairs   of  the  workshop  at
"glottolo@icnucevm.cnuce.cnr.it"  for  Nicoletta  Calzolari,
and  at   "chengming%bepc2@scs.bitnet"  for  Chengming  Guo.
Postal mail of three hard copies of  the paper  to Nicoletta
Calzolari and Chengming Guo are also acceptable. Papers must
be printed to 8 1/2 to 11"  size. Workshop preprints will be
made available to all attendees.

Paper submission  by the 15th of  May, 1994
Notification of acceptance by 5th June,  1994
Camera-ready copy by 30th  of June, 1994
