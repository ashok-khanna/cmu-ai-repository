THEME
Conceptual structures are a modern treatment of Charles Sanders
Peirce's Existential Graphs which are a graphic notation for classical
logic with higher order extensions developed in 1896. Peirce viewed
existential graphs as ``his luckiest discovery'' and ``a logic of the
future''. His view was that people should be able to build models in
logic much like modern designers build models of airplanes for
reasoning about real airplanes. Peirce's view was that you could
``see'' contradictions and processes in reasoning within existential
graphs.

John Sowa showed that conceptual graphs can be mapped to classical
predicate calculus or order sorted logic, and are thus seen as just
another (graphic) notation for logic. However, it is the topological
nature of formulas (topology was a field Peirce helped develop) which
conceptual graphs make clear, and which can be exploited in reasoning
and processing. Conceptual graphs are intuitive because they allow
humans to exploit their powerful pattern matching abilities to a larger
extent than does the classical notation.

Conceptual graphs can be viewed as an attempt to build a unified
modelling language and reasoning tool. Conceptual graphs can model
data, functional and dynamic aspects of systems. They form a unified
diagrammatic tool which can integrate Entity-Relationship diagrams,
Finite State Machines, Petri Nets, and Dataflow diagrams. Conceptual
graphs have a natural mapping to natural language.

TOPICS

Substantive papers are invited on the following topics:  application
and experience; case studies; conceptual analysis; natural language
processing; ontologies; implementation; and theory.  Argument for or
against the use of conceptual graphs is of particular interest.  This
may be done by comparisons with other representations on the basis of
expressiveness, intuitive aspect, ease of use, computational
performance, or reasoning simplicity. Comparisons can also be made by
translating existing case studies, which use well-known
representations, into conceptual graphs.

CONFERENCE LOCATION

The conference will be held at the University of California, Santa Cruz
in a redwood forest in the Santa Cruz mountains. The university and
conference facilities are retreat style with housing available in
family-style apartments residing on the campus. The university is well
serviced by buses to downtown Santa Cruz. The campus, just 10 minutes
from the oceanside, overlooks Monterey Bay, the popular surfing
beaches, and you can watch the eagles soar from the Birds of Prey
sanctuary which forms part of the campus.  Santa Cruz is approximately
a 90 minute bus ride from San Francisco airport and about 45 minutes
from San Jose.
