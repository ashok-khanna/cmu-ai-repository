5th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications

Date: September 7-9, 1994 	     	       Location: Athens,Greece




AIMS OF THE CONFERENCE
Use and development of database and expert systems can be found in all fields of computer science. The aim of DEXA 94 is to present a large spectrum of already implemented or just being developed database and expert systems. The conference will offer the opportunity to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in the field.
Contributions should cover new requirements, concepts for implementations (e.g. languages, models, storage structures), management of meta data, system architectures, and experiences gained by using  databases and expert systems in different areas of applications.
The conference should inspire a fruitful dialogue between developments in practice, users of database and expert systems, and scientists working in the field.

CASE				Knowledge Engineering
CIM				Legal Information Systems
