***********************1. GENERAL INFORMATION**************************

			ARTIFICIAL LIFE IV

		An Interdisciplinary Workshop on the 
		     Synthesis and Simulation of
                            Living Systems

                           July 6--8, 1994

                Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                        Cambridge, MA 02139
                                 USA

Artificial Life complements the traditional Biological sciences,
concerned with the analysis of living organisms, by attempting to
synthesize phenomena normally associated with natural living systems
within computers and other "artificial" media. By extending the
empirical foundation upon which the science of Biology rests beyond
the carbon-chain based life that has evolved on Earth, Artificial Life
can contribute to Theoretical Biology by locating "life-as-we-know-it"
within the larger context of "life-as-it-could-be."

The three previous workshops in this series were held in Santa Fe, New
Mexico.  This year's workshop, held primarily at Kresge Auditorium on
the MIT campus, is intended to continue in the spirit of the earlier
events, encouraging people with a broad range of backgrounds to share
and exchange opinions, ideas, and techniques.  Papers and posters will
be presented, and registrants will have the opportunity to sign up for
a tour of either the Artificial Intelligence Lab or the Media Lab, the
afternoon of July 7.  Participation in the tours is limited, however,
and will be on a first-come, first-served basis.

There will be five daytime sessions with plenary talks and parallel
paper presentations, an evening session on Wednesday the 6th,
and on Thursday afternoon there will be poster sessions, demonstrations,
panels, and small meetings.

Plenary speakers include:

	Chris Langton on the state of ALIFE
	Katsunori Shimohara on ALIFE research in Japan
	Luc Steels on `emergence'
	Jack Szostak on RNA-based evolution in a beaker

Wednesday evening we will have a set of talks and panels on SETI,
the search for extraterrestial life.  We will have the leaders of the
two major efforts in the US, Paul Horowitz from Harvard and Jill
Tarter from the SETI Institute (just recently spun off from NASA).
Both these efforts involve simultaneously scanning many frequencies
from radio telescope searches of the sky, looking for signs
of intelligent life.  Between ALIFE and SETI we will be covering
all forms of life not of natural Earth-based biological origin.

The proceedings will be published by MIT Press.  A loose-leaf version
will be provided to all registrants at the conference.  Approximately
two months following the conference, all registrants will receive a
bound copy from the MIT Press by surface mail.

For up to date information and announcements refer to "Events at the
AI Lab" under the home page for the MIT AI Lab on the World Wide Web
(at http://www.ai.mit.edu/). For questions or more information email
alife@ai.mit.edu.

linens are changed weekly. Guest rooms have telephones which allow
outgoing campus, local and long-distance (collect or credit card)
calls and all incoming calls.  Messages are taken by the front desk
and posted in the lobby as well.  All buildings are elevator equipped.
Each building has vending machines and coin-operated laundry machines

Sunday, July 3 and guests may extend their stay beyond the dates of
the Conference as rooms are available.  Nights either before the 5th
or after the 7th are exclusive of any meals.

single accomodations; $54 per night for double accomodations; and $10
per night for a cot (children between the ages of 6 and 14 only).

Reservations must be received by June 22, and payment is required at
the time of the reservation.  Requests received after June 22 will be
accepted on a space available basis only.  All requests should be sent

Sightseeing
-----------
Boston and Cambridge offer a wide variety of daytime and evening
activities, boasting a unique combination of tradition and trend.
Historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Marketplace---with their many
fascinating shops, craft stands and restaurants---are popular
gathering places for both area residents and visitors.  Copley Place,
along with the newly renovated Prudential Center, adds a contemporary
dimension to Boston's traditional Copley Square and Back Bay.
Attractions of particular interest to visitors include the USS
Constitution, the John F. Kennedy Library, the Museum of Science and
the Museum of Fine Arts.  The historic Freedom Trail takes the visitor
from the Boston Common through the popular markets of the North End
and the Waterfront districts.  Harvard Square, the Cambridge Common
and the University Museums are but a few of the points of interest on
the MIT side of the Charles River.

Questions
---------
Inquiries regarding local arrangements may be directed to the MIT
Conference Services Office at 617-253-1700 or via Fax at 671-253-7002.
