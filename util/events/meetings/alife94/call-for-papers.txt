                          Artificial Life IV

                    An Interdisciplinary Workshop
                   on the Synthesis and Simulation
                          of Living Systems

                             organized by:

                             Rodney Brooks
                    MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab

                             July 6-8, 1994
                           MIT, Cambridge, MA

                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                        Proceedings Editors:

We are happy to invite contributions for the Fourth Artificial Life
Workshop, to be held at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, July 6-8,
1994.

Artificial Life complements the traditional Biological sciences,
concerned with the analysis of living organisms, by attempting to
synthesize phenomena normally associated with natural living systems
within computers and other "artificial" media. By extending the
empirical foundation upon which the science of Biology rests beyond
the carbon-chain based life that has evolved on Earth, Artificial Life
can contribute to Theoretical Biology by locating "life-as-we-know-it"
within the larger context of "life-as-it-could-be."

The three previous workshops in this series were held in Santa Fe, New
Mexico.  Next year's workshop is intended to continue in the spirit of
the earlier events, encouraging people with a broad range of
backgrounds to share and exchange opinions, ideas, and techniques.

Contributions may made in the following categories: PAPER (30 minutes
for presentation and questions); DEMONSTRATION, which includes robots,
computer demos and/or videos (please give time estimate).

Some PAPER contributions may be accepted as POSTERs.  Presentations of
posters may include a computer display (BYOC).

Authors of PAPERs should send 4 copies of a full paper, not to
exceed 14 pages of 12pt single spaced text to the address below by
March 15, 1994 (you get to work all weekend then send it express on
Monday the 14th...).  No papers will be accepted for review after
March 15th.  Authors will be notified of the status of their
contributions by April 15, 1994.  Contributions should include an
email address, telephone and fax numbers on the cover page.

Proprietors of DEMONSTRATIONs should send a maximum four page abstract
describing their contribution to the same address by March 15th.
DEMONSTRATIONs will be held on Thursday afternoon, July 7th, and will
incorporate an ``Artificial 4-H show''.

All accepted PAPERs will be included in the proceedings which will be
available to all registered participants at the workshop.  Some
POSTERs may be included in the proceedings, and some DEMONSTRATIONs
will be included in a companion videotape.  There will be a very tight
production schedule on the proceedings and camera ready copy will be
absolutely due by Friday May 13th.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

        * Self-organization and emergent functionality
        * Definitions of life
        * Origin of life
        * Self-reproduction
        * Computer viruses
        * Synthesis of "the living state"
        * Evolution and population genetics
        * Coevolution and ecological dynamics
        * Growth, development and differentiation
        * Organization and behavior of social and colonial organisms
        * Animal behavior
        * Global and local ecosystems and their interactions
        * Autonomous agents (mobile robots and software agents)
        * Collective intelligence ("swarm" intelligence)
        * Theoretical biology
        * Philosophical issues in Alife (from Ontology to Ethics)
        * Formalisms and tools for Alife research
        * Guidelines and safeguards for the practice of Alife

Papers should be sent to:

                        Rodney Brooks/Alife IV
                        MIT Artificial Ingelligence Lab
