4th National Conference on Law, Computers and Artificial Intelligence

            21-22 April, 1994, University of Exeter

                          Call for Papers

Themes
------

There are two main conference themes: legal knowledge representation,
and ethical considerations.

Legal knowledge representation:  The  fundamental  problem of  how  to
represent law    computationally  is still   an  unresolved  question.
Logic-based and  rule-based representations and  strategies, initially
adopted  because  of the ease with  which  potentially useful mappings
between legal knowledge and computational expression could be derived,
are proving inadequate for conveying the  many senses, nuances, social
interpretations and uses of law  which human experts  effortlessly and
intuitively adopt.

One theme  of the   conference   will  be to  explore  next-generation
computational  representations   of  law,   including object-oriented,
frame-based and  connectionist (distributed) representations,   and to
compare and  contrast these  with  current  representation techniques.
Philosophical and  jurisprudential  assumptions,  as well as practical
applications in areas such as computer-aided learning of law and legal
expert systems, fall within this theme.

Ethical considerations: A second theme concerns the anxiety  about the
social and ethical  implications of what is being  done in the overlap
area of   law  and AI. Do  we   really  want  to  devote  resources to
describing, explaining  and   analyzing law,  or to devising  nonhuman
responses about the interpretation and application of legal rules?

PAPERS ADDRESSING OTHER ISSUES WHICH FALL WITHIN THE OVERLAP AREAS OF
LAW, COMPUTER SCIENCE AND AI ARE ALSO WELCOME.

Papers of less than 5000 words in length and  including an abstract of
less  than 200  words  should be  sent  to any of the  local  Academic
Contacts by  1ST OCTOBER, 1993.  Authors  should  clearly indicate the
theme, if any, addressed by their paper.  Authors will  be notified of
acceptance  by 1st December,  1993  after  papers have been  refereed.
Final versions of  the papers will be  required by 1st  March, 1994 so
that  they  can  be  distributed  to  participants  in advance of  the
Conference.  (Copyright will be retained by authors.)

Conference details
------------------

The conference will start at 2pm on  Thursday, 21 April  and finish at
5pm on  Friday,  22 April. A special  tutorial introduction  to neural
computing representations of law will be offered on the  morning of 22
April.

Accommodation and full board, plus registration fees and a copy of the
advanced  proceedings,  are estimated  to  be  about   120  pounds for
academics and 200    pounds  for non-academics,  with  reductions  for
students.  Registration forms, information and  further details can be
obtained from the local Academic Contacts.
