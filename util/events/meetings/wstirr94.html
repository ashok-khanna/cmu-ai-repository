CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on Spatial and Temporal Interaction: Representation and Reasoning

AIMS
The representational issues of spatial and temporal knowledge are
fundamental to several disciplines, such as Intelligent Systems,
Planning, Natural Language Understanding, Intelligent Process Control,
and Discrete Simulation.  Each discipline uses its own specific
methods to model time and space.  Further, there are diverse ways in
which spatio-temporal reasoning is applied in different application
domains.  This workshop seeks to bring together researchers from
different fields to exchange and share ideas on this subject.

This one day workshop will be organised in Singapore in conjunction
with the International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Computer
Vision on 8th of November 1994.  The format of the workshop will be a
single track session where participants will present their work and
have time to discuss and summarise the presented work.  It is the aim
of the workshop to provide the forum for formal presentation and
informal discussions.  The number of participants will be limited to
around 30 to allow for meaningful discussions.

TOPICS
Submissions are invited in the following areas ( not an exclusive list):
        Spatial and Temporal Representation in
                        Vision and AI
                        Intelligent Systems
                        Intelligent Control
