HYPERTEXT'93
CALL FOR DEMOS & POSTERS
1993 ACM Conference on Hypertext
Seattle, Washington, USA
November 14-18, 1993


DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT: Monday, August 2, 1993

Last call (this time for sure)!!:
	There's not much time left to propose a demonstration or a poster
	for presentation at Hypertext'93.

Posters and demos allow researchers to present late-breaking
results, significant work in progress, or work that is best presented in
conversation.  Poster and demo sessions permit a more direct, one-on-one
exchange of ideas.

Demos are an effective way to present a hypertext technique or application
that is embodied in a working system.  Please indicate hardware and software
requirements.

Posters are an effective way to present hypertext ideas, methods, techniques
and empirical findings.  Posters can also be used to describe working systems
when supporting hardware/software is unnecessary or unavailable.

Demos and posters are presented in parallel during two sessions.  (Sessions
will probably be 6-9pm on Tuesday & 4-6:30 on Wednesday; posters will also
be on display throughout the conference.)  Because of the interactive
nature of poster/demo presentations, presenters should be available at all
times during each of the scheduled sessions.  In general, this will mean
that only one submission will be accepted per presenter.

This is not a trade show exhibit.  Presenters should be directly involved in
the work being presented rather than marketing or sales people.
