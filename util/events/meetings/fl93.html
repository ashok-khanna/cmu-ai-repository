                     The first International Conference
                          On Fuzzy Logic Systems
                    Development Tools and Applications
     
                             July 20-22, 1993
                    Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport
          
     Fuzzy Logic '93 is the first conference devoted to the practical
     applications of fuzzy logic hardware and software and the tools
     used to develop these applications. The conference encompasses
     real-time and embedded control as well as general computing
     applications and information processing systems that can benefit
     from the natural language, expert systems capabilities of fuzzy
     logic. Fuzzy Logic '93 will provide a mix of in-depth tutorials,
     tightly focused lectures, multi-paper applications-oriented
     sessions, demonstration workshops, and free-wheeling
     evening discussions led by fuzzy experts.  All in a 3-day,
     "total immersion" environment in which designers will mingle
     with the experts in fuzzy logic and exchange ideas with
     colleagues talking real-world designs.

                         A Focus on the Real World
                         -------------------------
     
     THE ATTENDEES
     
     Fuzzy Logic '93 is a hands-on, down-to-earth conference aimed at
     hardware and software engineers and engineering managers,
     scientists and information-processing professionals.
     Specifically, Fuzzy Logic '93 is targeted at individuals with a
     solid background in electronic/computer system design and
     development (both hardware and software), applications
     programming, and information science and analysis who are looking
     for the most up-to-date information on:
     
     
     Embedded control systems. Fuzzy logic has proven itself in
     practical applications, most notably in Japan, from controlling
     subway systems to video cameras to intelligent washing machines
     to rice cookers. At Fuzzy Logic '93, embedded control designers
     will learn how to implement fuzzy's smooth, continuous control to
     extend product life, reduce the amount of code needed and lower
     system and development cost.
     
     Expert systems. Fuzzy logic makes it easier to capture the
     knowledge of experts in various applications because fuzzy
     concepts mirror the way experts would actually describe a
     problem. Application areas range from medical diagnostics and
     patient monitoring, military intelligence assessment, criminal
     investigation, mechanical and electrical design, resource
     management, and ergonomics.
     
     Information science. Systems for business and commercial
     applications such as financial forecasting, insurance risk
     assessment and acquisition analysis can use fuzzy logic to
     identify trends and reveal unexpected relationships. Fuzzy logic
     offers solutions to those problems where developers are being
     stymied trying to combine approximate reasoning with traditional
     programming models.
     
     Hardware design and system implementation. Fuzzy logic
     processors, coprocessors and board-level products exist and
     designers need information on how to integrate this fuzzy
     hardware as the core of a product, combine fuzzy processors with
     traditional microprocessors, or use fuzzy ASIC (application-
     specific integrated circuit) cores in their application-specific
     designs.
     
     Software development tools. Software developers need to learn
     about the various powerful, low-cost development tools, most of
     them PC-based, that can be used to quickly and easily develop
     fuzzy-based applications. These tools let designers work with
     graphs and natural language that are at the heart of fuzzy
     logic--unfamiliar approaches to most software developers schooled
     in traditional programming techniques.

     THE PROGRAM
     
     The core technical program for Fuzzy Logic '93 will consist of
     half-day tutorials, one-hour lectures, 20-minute
     application-oriented presentations, and two-hour demonstration

     presentation in the format that's most appropriate to the
     complexity and focus of the subject matter you would like to
     cover. The following subjects fall within the scope of Fuzzy
     Logic '93 but you are free to suggest other topics that might be

     Presentation proposals will be selected based on applicability to
     solving real hardware design, software development and
     application problems -- not on the basis of elegance or academic
     value.
     
     Participation in the Fuzzy Logic '93 is open to any individual or
     organization involved with the design and development of fuzzy
     logic components or subsystems; fuzzy logic applications
     software; fuzzy logic software development tools; and the
     development of industrial, business, military or consumer
     products--either hardware or software--that are based on fuzzy
     logic principles.
     
     You may participate in the Fuzzy Logic '93 program by submitting
     a proposal for either a one-hour lecture presentation, a
     20-minute application-focused paper, or a longer tutorial. Please
     submit your proposal no later than January 31, 1993.
     
     The proposal should be no longer than one page and consist of a
     short abstract that summarizes the content and goals of the
     presentation, and a brief outline of the major topics covered by
     the presentation. Presenters must be technically qualified and
     able to answer questions from attendees. A short biography of the
     presenter, detailing his or her qualifications and
     accomplishments must accompany the proposal.
     
     Acceptance of presentation proposals will be made by February 15,
     1993. A complete copy of the presentation, including all visuals
     and graphics, for publication in the Conference Proceedings must
     be provided by June 1, 1993. Presentations given at Fuzzy Logic
     '93 will be published in the Proceedings and copyright shall be
