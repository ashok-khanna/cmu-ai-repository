                                 CALL FOR PAPERS

  TIME-94: An International Workshop on Temporal Representation and Reasoning
                         (in conjunction with FLAIRS-94)

                          Pensacola Beach, Florida, USA
                                   May 4, 1994

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together active researchers in the area
of temporal representation and reasoning in Artificial Intelligence. Through
paper presentations and discussions, the participants will exchange, compare,
and contrast results in the area. The work shop is planned as a one-day event to
immediately precede FLAIRS-94 (Florida Artificial Intelligence Research
Symposium). Workshop participants are encouraged to also submit papers to FLAIRS
a nd attend the conference. The workshop will be conducted as a combination of
paper presentations, a poster session, an invited talk, and a panel discussion.
The format will provide ample time for discussions and exchange of ideas. The
workshop registration fee will be waived for those who register for FLAIRS-94.
Submission of high quality papers or extended abstracts describing mature
results or on-going work are invited for all areas of temporal representation
and reasoning, including, but not limited to:

     temporal logics and ontologies
     temporal languages and architectures
     planning, actions, and events
     frame problem
     continuous versus discrete time
     point versus interval representations
     temporal knowledge, belief, and uncertainty
     temporal learning and discovery
     multiple agents, communication, and synchronization
     foundational issues and applications

To maximize interaction among participants, the size of the workshop will be
limited. Accepted papers will be invited for full presentation or a poster
presentation. All submissions must be received by December 1, 1993. Notification
of acceptance or rejection will be sent to the first author (or designated
author) on February 1, 1994. Prospective participants should submit 5 copies of
a 5-8 page extended abstract to:
	TIME-94,
	Department of Computer Science,
	University of Regina,
	Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada S4S 0A2.
For further information and future announcements send email to:

                              INVITED SPEAKER

Thomas Dean is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brown
University.  His research is concerned with theories of temporal and spatial
inference for reasoning about actions and processes.  His current focus is on
reasoning with incomplete and probabilistic information.  Dean was the recipient
of an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1989.  He was program
co-chair for the 1991 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and
currently serves on the AAAI Council.
