TUTORIAL 1: Object-Oriented Multimedia Technology
Instructor: Max Muehlhaeuser
            University of Karlsruhe, Germany
Level:      Beginning
Time:       Monday, 4 July, 9.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
The tutorial is intended for researchers and practitioners who 
want to gain an overview about multimedia technology - 
multimedia/hypermedia software development and  distribution in 
particular - with a special focus on  object-oriented approaches. 
 
ABSTRACT: 
The tutorial will provide both a "broad" introduction into  
multimedia technology and a more "in-depth" coverage of "object- 
oriented" multimedia technology. The attendant will be able to 
familiarize with current standards  and methods as well as open 
issues with respect to both  stand-alone and distributed multimedia. 
She/He will get an understanding of ways to extend object-oriented 
concepts for the support of multimedia. Particular attention will be 
paid to issues like distribution, cooperation,  OO multimedia 
services, hypermedia integration, and emerging OO multimedia 
standards and frameworks. Part 1, the "broad" introduction, will 
comprise chapters like: "overview and reference architectures", 
"interaction and compression", "storage, documents & archives", 
"Network and OS support", "synchronization, platforms & services". 
Part 2, the OO related part, addresses areas like "multimedia object 
models", "OO multimedia programming", "OO and hypermedia", 
"distributed multimedia objects", and "towards media-integrated OO 
frameworks".

Max Muehlhaeuser received both his Diploma and his Doctorate in 
Informatics (Computer Science) from the University of Karlsruhe, 
West Germany.
He set up and managed a campus-based research center for Digital 
Equipment and worked as a Professor for Computer Science at the 
University of Kaiserslautern. 
Since 1992, he is Professor for Distributed Systems at the Institute
for Telematics in Karlsruhe and head of the Telecooperation Group. 
His research interests include software engineering for distributed
applications, object-oriented distributed programming, graphical
and iconic design/programming, distributed multimedia systems,
hypermedia, software technology for media-integrated software 
systems, workflow/cooperation and mobility support, cooperative 
computer-aided authoring/learning, computer-aided instructional 
design, and distributed simulation and debugging.


TUTORIAL 2: Testing Object-Oriented Software
Instructor: John D. McGregor
            Clemson University and Software Architects, USA
Level:      Advanced
Time:       Monday, 4 July, 9.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
The tutorial assumes experience using object technology to
develop software and a typical developer's knowledge about
software testing.

ABSTRACT:
This tutorial has two major goals: 
(1) to present techniques for building classes that are testable; 
(2) to present a process and techniques for a comprehensive testing 
    process within a software development project.
The tutorial presents class design guidelines about building "hooks"
that support the testing process, a set of algorithms for 
generating test cases, and a case study of a small, but complete, 
software system. The case study will relate the various analysis, 
design, and implementation work products to the development of test 
harnesses, and the management of test cases. The techniques 
presented are intended to minimize the number of test cases that 
must be built for adequate coverage, to minimize the number of those 
test  cases that must be executed at any time, and to accommodate
varying test coverage requirements in a consistent manner. 

John D. McGregor is an Associate Professor of Computer
Science at Clemson University and a principal partner in Software
Architects, a software design consulting firm, specializing in
object-oriented design techniques. he has made
presentations and presented tutorials on object-oriented
techniques at numerous conferences and for a variety of
companies. He is co-author of "Object-oriented
Software Development: Engineering Software for Reuse" published

Science Foundation, Bell Northern Research, and IBM.


TUTORIAL 3: Evaluating Object Database Management Systems 
Instructor: Roberto Zicari
            Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitaet, Germany
Level:      Beginning
Time:       Monday, 4 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Professionals and Researchers with a background
in Object Technology and of classical database technology.
IT managers who wish to evaluate an ODMS.
Knowledge of an object oriented programming language and 
conventional database is preferred.

ABSTRACT:
The tutorial is divided in two parts. Part one will offer an  
in-depth description of the relevant features of  an ODMS (e.g.
query languages, schema evolution, language bindings.  versioning,
architecture). The focus is on the database features rather than 
the OO features in general. Each feature will be illustrated by 
means of examples. Part two will present a framework for classifying 
and evaluating the various ODBMS products.  
It will also cover standardization activities such as the ODMG-93 
specification and its relationships with OMG-standards (i.e. CORBA). 
An overview of the market for ODBMSs will also be offered.

TUTORIAL 4:  Object Management Systems (OMS)
Instructors: Aleks Gollu, UC Berkeley/Meta-X, USA
             Akash Deshpande, UC Berkeley/Amravan, USA
Level:       Intermediate
Time:        Monday, 4 July, 9.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Basic understanding of object oriented methodology and database 
concepts and some experience with large scale software application 
delivery is helpful.
Project managers and development and research engineers can attend.

ABSTRACT:
Most Large Scale Software Applications use a logical representation 
to simulate and control the behavior of a physical system. The range 
of these applications is vast: Data Network Management (DNM), Power 
Distribution Management, Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS),
and increasingly even Management Information Systems. Such 
applications benefit immensely from the Object Mangement System(OMS) 
approach. The OMS approach consists of 1) the OMS software platform 
and 2) the OMS implementation process. OMS software platform 
provides a unifying framework for semantic data modeling, client-
server architectures, concurrent user support, data distribution, 
persistent storage, and performance optimization.  The OMS 
implementation process defines the stages of a project life-cycle 
including the key players involved and the time and resource 
requirements. We present case studies of  completed DNM and IVHS 
projects that employed OMS. We discuss the OMS  approach using 
today's software technologies and identify areas for  future 
enhancements of the OMS platform based on emerging technologies. 

Aleks Gollu and Akash Deshpande each have 10 years of experience in
Large Scale Software Development and Database Management Systems
ranging from system development to project management. They have
worked on such large projects as Concert - British Telecom's 
trademark Integrated Network Management System (NMS), Accumaster 
Integrator - AT&T's trademark NMS, Megastream - Bell Canada's 
flagship NMS, and PATH UC Berkeley and Caltrans' Intelligent Vehicle 
Highway System (IVHS).

Aleks Gollu has received his BS at MIT and MS at UC Berkeley in
Electrical Engineering. He currently is a PhD. candidate at UC
Berkeley where his research interests include Object Management
Systems for Power Distribution Systems and IVHS planning.  Aleks
Gollu's industry experience includes work at Oracle and Teknekron
Communication Systems. He has presented experience reports about his
projects at past OOPSLAs. He is also the president of Meta-X, a
Berkeley, California based training and consulting firm.

Akash Deshpande received his BTech at IIT Bombay and MS at 
University of Florida in Electrical Engineering, where at the 
Database Research Center he designed a computer architecture for 
non-numerical processing on Very Large Databases. He currently is a 
PhD.  candidate at UC Berkeley where his research interests include 
semantic data modeling and real-time performance specification and 
verification for the IVHS project.  Akash Deshpande's industry 
experience includes work at AT&T and Teknekron Communication 
Systems. He has sat on committee meetings of OSI/NM Forum (an 
international network management standards organization). He is also 
the director of Amravan Group, a Berkeley, California and 
Pondicherry, India based consulting firm. 


TUTORIAL 5: Distributed Computing using Objects
Instructor: Eric Jul
            University of Copenhagen, Denmark
Level:      Intermediate
Time:       Monday, 4 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
The tutorial assumes basic knowledge of object-oriented concepts.
No previous knowledge of distributed computing is required, however,
experience with one or more OO programming languages would be 
helpful.

ABSTRACT:
As computer networks become faster and cheaper, it becomes more
and more desirable to use distributed computing.
Object-oriented programming seems to mesh exceptionally well with
the paradigms of distributed programming because of object
encapsulation and the clean interface presented by an object.
The aim of this tutorial is to motivate and demonstrate
the use of objects for distributed computing.
The tutorial will cover the basic ideas and paradigms of
distributed computing including
   * communication, RPC
   * remote referencing
   * parallel processes
   * distributed, globally shared objects
   * distributed synchronization
   * reliability/failure handling
   * replicated objects
   * persistent objects
   * wide area vs. local area networks
   * load sharing/load balancing
   * examples of distributed programs
   * what to look for in a distributed OO language
   * overview of available distributed object systems
   * short overview of major implementation issues
All major points will be illustrated by examples written
in the distributed, object-oriented language, Emerald;
however, you need no previous knowledge of Emerald.
This tutorial will provide you with a general overview of how and
why to use distribution and objects.

Eric Jul is an Associate Professor at DIKU, the Dept. of Computer
Science, University of Copenhagen where he is the leader of the
DistLab group which is doing research in distributed, heterogeneous
computing. 
He is a co-designer and implementor of the Emerald distributed
object-oriented programming language developed at the University of
Washington.  His interests include distributed, OO languages, 
operating systems support for such languages including distributed 
storage  management (distributed shared memory and garbage 
collection) and object-oriented design and analysis. He has run a 
number workshops related to distributed computing at previous 
ECOOP/OOPSLA conferences. 


TUTORIAL 6: The ANSA Architecture for Distributed Computing
Instructor: Hugh Tonks
            Architecture Projects Management Ltd., UK
Level:      Intermediate
Time:       Monday, 4 July, 14.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
This is a beginner's guide to distributed systems concepts, but is
also suitable for intermediate or advanced level people in any
computing discipline. It is intended for system integrators, 
strategists, designers, programmers, or anyone technical 
with an interest in distributed computing, object-based
technology or client/server systems.

ABSTRACT:
The ANSA architecture has been designed primarily to help solve the 
twin problem sets of heterogeneous systems and distributed 
computing; in particular, it deals with issues of achieving 
interoperability between future systems and existing systems. In 
doing so, it draws on ideas from a wide range of computing 
disciplines, including object orientation, to provide generic 
techniques and principles which can be used effectively in the 
design and construction of distributed systems.   
This tutorial will cover the fundamental principles of ANSA, showing 
how they can be applied to real systems development, and how ANSA 
relates to other distributed computing initiatives. Specific topics 
will include the nature of architecture, the use of client/server 
and objects as the basis for building large systems, the application 
of tool-based solutions, some concrete examples of how ANSA 
principles and concepts can be realised in code, and how the 
programmer's view of a distributed system might look in the future.  
Objects will be discussed in some detail, not necessarily as a 
solution in themselves, but as crucial components of any ANSA-based 
approach to systems design and implementation. This tutorial will be 
fairly intensive, as it is essential to cover a number of 
interrelated concepts in a short time in order to put over the 
complete ANSA picture accurately.

Hugh Tonks has been with the ANSA programme for over five years, 
both as a member of the research team working on persistence, and 
latterly as business manager. Prior to ANSA, after graduating in 
Computer Science from Cambridge, he worked for GEC Marconi Research 
and Torch Computers, as a consultant to the thoroughbred racehorse 
industry, and for the US Department of Customs in Saudi Arabia, 
specialising in database applications.


TUTORIAL 7: Models and Paradigms of Interaction
Instructor: Peter Wegner
            Brown University, USA
Level:      Intermediate
Time:       Tuesday, 5 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Persons interested in the conceptual foundations of object-oriented 
programming and in the notion of interaction as a first-class form 
of computation. 

ABSTRACT:
Our goal is to develop a conceptual framework for object-oriented  
programming in terms of models of interaction and component-based  
software technology. We will develop a model of component 
interaction, showing that models of object-oriented software 
engineering such as  Rumbaugh's object model and Jacobson's use-case 
model are models  of interaction rather than computation. Life-cycle 
models, open systems,  and scalability will be expressed in terms of 
models of interaction.  Processes, application program interfaces, 
frameworks, multidatabases,  GUIs,  robots, and virtual reality will 
be uniformly described as  paradigms of interaction. We will show 
that object-oriented models of  interaction have inherently greater 
expressive power than algorithmic  models of computation because 
they determine a "marriage contract" for interactive services over 
time that cannot be expressed by a  pattern of time-independent 
"sales contracts". This result provides  a technical explanation for 
the fact that models for programming in the large are based on 
software components rather than  functional or logic programming 
languages. Lecture notes will include a 35-page paper on ``Models 
and Paradigms of  Interaction'' appearing in the proceedings of last 
year's ECOOP  workshop on distributed object-oriented programming 
(Springer-Verlag  Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1994).

Peter Wegner, a Professor of Computer Science at Brown University, 
was educated at London and Cambridge, and taught at Cornell, Penn 
State, and the London School of Economics before coming to Brown. 
His research interests include programming languages and software 
engineering. He has authored or edited a dozen books including the 
first book on Ada in 1980, and has edited books on research 
directions in software engineering and object-oriented programming. 
He has contributed to object-oriented programming in the areas of 
type theory, concurrency, and language design issues. He is 
interested in component-based software technology and models of 
interaction as an integrating framework for object-oriented and 
multiparadigm programming.


TUTORIAL 8:  Adaptive C++ Software
Instructors: Karl Lieberherr, Cristina Videira Lopes, Walter Huersch
             Northeastern University, USA
Level:       Intermediate
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 14.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Intermediate level C++ programming. The tutorial is aimed at 
software professionals wanting to write C++ programs faster and in a 
more reusable form.

ABSTRACT:
As object-oriented projects grow above a few dozen classes, they 
tend to hit the small methods productivity wall - the point at which 
a large number of small methods exist in the software. The many 
small methods make maintenance of the software difficult, especially 
when the structure of the objects evolves. This tutorial defines the 
problem and presents a practical solution based on adaptive 
software. Adaptive software is a high-level description of object-
oriented software and allows to significantly improve the ease of 
maintenance of object-oriented software. 

Karl J. Lieberherr is a Professor in the College of Computer Science 
at Northeastern University in Boston and Director of the Center for 
Software Sciences. His current research interests are in object-
oriented software engineering. His research group is developing the 
Demeter System, consisting of the Method and the Tools, to 
facilitate software development by introducing novel high-level 
abstractions. The most important contribution of the Demeter System 
is the concept of adaptive software which generalizes object-
oriented software and which amplifies its advantages while 
eliminating some of its disadvantages. He is working on a book on 
the Adaptive Software which is published by PWS Publishing Company 
together with the Demeter Tools. Karl Lieberherr has given tutorials 
before at OOPSLA '91, '92, ECOOP '92, Electro '92, The MIT Summer 
School since 1992, National Technological University and at several 
companies.

Cristina Videira Lopes is a PhD candidate in the College of Computer 
Science at Northeastern University in Boston. She participated in 
the ESPRIT Project COMANDOS. Her current research interests are in 
object-oriented software engineering, with focus on distributed 
applications. She is a member of the Demeter System research and 
development team.

Walter Hurschis a PhD candidate in the College of Computer Science 
at Northeastern University in Boston. His current research interests 
are in object-oriented software engineering with a focus on software 
evolution. Heis a member of the Demeter System research and 
development team


TUTORIAL 9:  Object-Oriented Reuse - From Management to Coding 
             (The REBOOT Approach)
Instructors: Frank Buschmann, Hans Guenter Tempel
             Siemens AG, Corporate Research and Development, Germany
Level:       Intermediate
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 9.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Managers of software development organizations using object-oriented 
technology and of object-oriented projects. Software developers 
having a sound knowledge of object-oriented technology. Anyone 
interested in reuse using object-oriented techniques.

ABSTRACT:
Reuse is regarded as one of the most promising approaches to master 
the challenges of software development. However, although this goal 
sounds desirable it is not easy to achieve. This tutorial presents a 
sound foundation for object-oriented reuse to succeed as well as to 
promote organized reuse. A managerial part is covering 
organizational and managerial issues related to software reuse, such 
as organizational structures, project management, and library 
management. A technical part presents concrete methods, techniques, 
and guidelines supporting software development for and with reuse as 
well as re-engineering for reuse. The tutorial is based on the 
ESPRIT-III project REBOOT (REuse Based on Object-Oriented 
Techniques) where the presented approach was developed and 
successfully applied for various industrial applications. The 
overall goal of the tutorial can be broken down into several 
subgoals:
   * Providing a sound and complete understanding of the reuse 
     problem space. 
   * Providing a guide for how to introduce and continuously measure 
     and improve the reuse capability of an organization.
   * Facilitating the mastery of the techniques needed to organize 
     and develop for and with reuse.
A real world example is used throughout the tutorial in order to 
illustrate and explain the various organizational, managerial, 
methodological and technical issues related to software reuse.

TUTORIAL 10: How to Develop Frameworks
Instructor:  Ralph E. Johnson
             University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA
Level:       Advanced
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
A year or two experience developing object-oriented  software.

ABSTRACT:
This tutorial will describe a process for developing frameworks.
The process is driven by examples, which are used both to design
a new framework and to document it when it is finished. A framework
is developed by generalizing and abstracting from examples. The
tutorial will show how standard design transformations are used to
generalize existing systems, making them more reusable and abstract.
It will discuss how to choose examples, how to manage the iteration
that seems to be an inevitable part of framework development, and
the importance of common design patterns that arise as a framework
is being developed (see Tutorial 11 on design patterns).Developing a 
framework is expensive, but it is valuable. This tutorial will help 
you to estimate the costs involved in developing a framework. It 
will frankly discuss problems in paying for framework development, 
though unfortunately it does not offer any easy solutions.

For the past 8 years, Prof. Johnson has been studying object-
oriented technology and how it changes the way software is 
developed. He has been involved in the development of an object-
oriented operating system (Choices), compiler (Typed Smalltalk), 
graphics editor framework (HotDraw), music synthesis system (Kyma), 
and is currently working on a framework for accounting.  He is on 
the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and has helped organize several 
OOPSLA's, including OOPSLA'93 as program chair.


TUTORIAL 11: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented 
Software
Instructor:  Richard Helm, DMR Group, Inc.,Canada
             John Vlissides, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, USA 
Level:       Advanced
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 14.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Attendees should understand basic object-oriented concepts, like 
polymorphism and type versus interface inheritance, and should have 
had some experience designing object-oriented systems.

ABSTRACT:
Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable 
object-oriented software is even harder. Experience shows that many 
object-oriented systems exhibit recurring structures or "design 
patterns" of communicating and collaborating objects that promote 
extensibility, flexibility, and reusability.  This course describes 
a set of fundamental design patterns and, through a design scenario, 
demonstrates how to build reusable object-oriented software with 
them. Participants will acquire experience in using design patterns 
to solve real problems.  This experience will enhance participants' 
design abilities by teaching them how to apply design patterns to 
their own object-oriented systems. The course covers the roles 
design patterns play in the object-oriented development process: how 
they provide a common vocabulary, reduce system complexity, and how 
they act as reusable architectural elements that contribute to an 
overall system architecture.

Richard Helm is a Senior Technology Consultant with DMR Group, 
an international information technology consulting firm.  
There he is actively applying design patterns to the design of 
commercial systems. He has numerous international publications 
and is a past OOPSLA program committee member. He has a Ph.D. in 
Computer Science from the University of Melbourne, Australia.

John Vlissides is a researcher at the IBM T.J. Watson Research 
Center. His research interests include object-oriented design tools 
and techniques, application frameworks and builders, and program 
visualization. Before IBM, he was at the Computer Systems Laboratory 
at Stanford University.  There he co-developed InterViews, a popular 
object-oriented system for developing graphical applications.  He 
has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University.


TUTORIAL 12: Formal Methods for Object-Oriented Software 
             Engineering Methodologies.	
Instructor:  Mahesh Dodani
             University of Iowa, USA
Level:       Advanced
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
This tutorial is appropriate for software engineers with some 
experience using object-oriented methodologies. A basic knowledge of 
logic is assumed.

ABSTRACT
This tutorial views object-oriented software engineering 
methodologies as comprising two components: a set of methods to 
build the object, dynamic, and functional models of software; and a 
process that governs the use of the methods for software 
development. The aim of the tutorial is to present the state-of-the-
art in semantically rich object-oriented methodologies. Such 
methodologies employ formal methods for the object, dynamic and 
functional models of software. These formal methods allow clear, 
concise, and unambiguous specifications, and facilitate verification 
of correctness, completeness, and consistency. The precise semantics 
allow properties of the software to be validated, and consistency 
across the models to be established. Realistic case studies are used 
to facilitate a deeper understanding of using the methods. A "use-
case" driven process is used to establish consistency across the 
models.

Mahesh Dodani is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the 
University of Iowa where he directs several groups conducting 
object- oriented (OO) research. He has been involved in building 
many OO systems ranging from interface builders to database design 
tools. He has experience with the popular OO software engineering 
methodologies (including Booch, OMT, FUSION, and Coad/Yourden), and 
semantically rich methods (including COLD, Larch, OBJ3, StateCharts, 
and Z). He is the major proponent of instituting a M.S. subtrack 
that provides practical and realistic OO software engineering 
education and training. He has consulted with several industrial 
organizations on OO technologies, and is a regular presenter of 
tutorials.  


TUTORIAL 13: Objects and Constraint Programming
Instructors: Alan Borning, Gus Lopez
             University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA
Level:       Advanced
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 14.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Knowledge of object-oriented programming, including both general 
concepts and knowledge of a specific object-oriented language is 
required. Knowing a logic programming language such as Prolog would 
be helpful but not essential. We won't assume prior background in 
constraint-based systems.

ABSTRACT:
A constraint is a relation that should be satisfied, for example, 
that a line remain horizontal, that a resistor in an electrical 
circuit simulation obey Ohm's Law, or that the height of a bar in a 
bar chart be proportional to some number in an application program. 
Constraints have been used in a variety of languages and systems, 
particularly in user interface toolkits, in planning and scheduling, 
and in simulation.  Constraint hierarchies, which consist of both 
required and preferential constraints, add additional power to 
constraint systems. The tutorial will provide attendees with a 
background in the theory of constraints; constraint-based 
programming languages, in particular constraint imperative 
programming, and constraints and object-oriented languages; 
constraint satisfaction algorithms, and using constraints in 
applications such as user interfaces. A particular area of emphasis 
will be constraints and objects, and in particular the 
Kaleidoscope'93 language, an experimental object-oriented constraint 
imperative programming language.

Alan Borning is currently a Professor in the Department of Computer 
Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, 
USA. He received a B.A. degree in mathematics from Reed College, and 
a M.Sc. and Ph.D. degree from Stanford University.  While at 
Stanford, he did his dissertation research with Alan Kay and the 
Learning Research Group at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he 
worked on constraint-based simulation environments.  He has been at 
the University of Washington since 1980.  His current research 
primarily concerns constraint-based languages and systems, 
particularly as tools for building user interfaces and interactive 
graphical simulations.  Other research interests include object-
oriented languages and human-computer interaction.

Gus Lopez is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science 
and Engineering at the University of Washington, doing dissertation 
research on the design and implementation of constraint imperative 
languages.  He has a B.S. degree from MIT and an M.S.  from Brown 
University, both in Computer Science.  Prior to coming to UW he also 
worked as systems engineer at ATT Bell Laboratories.


TUTORIAL 14: Open Distributed Processing and Telecommunications
Instructors: Fausto Caneschi, Tecsiel-STET, Italy
             Corrado Moiso, CSELT-STET, Italy
Level:       Intermediate
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 9.00-12.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
The tutorial is oriented to an audience with some knowledge of 
distributed processing concepts.

ABSTRACT:
The 1995-2000 telecom scenarios will be characterized by an 
integration of advanced communication services and Information 
Technology to offer a large variety of business social and 
entertainment services. The tutorial consists of two parts. The 
former will illustrate the ODP Reference Model, the new 
ISO-ITU-TS standard for Open Distributed Processing. The basic 
concepts  of the general framework for ODP will be dealt with, 
including the object-based model and the concept of viewpoints. The 
latter part of the tutorial will focus on the current and the 
potential future impact of Distributed Object Models, Architectures 
and Technologies on the Telecommunication world. This part of the 
tutorial will survey the telecommunication standards and 
European/worldwide initiatives (RACE Projects, TINA-Consortium) 
where object orientation and ODP Reference Model are playing a major 
role.

Fausto Caneschi graduated at the Pisa University in Electronic 
Engineering. He has been working in the field of computer networks 
at the National Research Council of Italy since 1977, participating 
in the development of high level protocols for various scientific 
networks. Since 1988, he is a member of the ISO group developing the 
ODP Reference Model. In this group, he is now the Editor of the 
"Overview and Guide to use" of the ODP model. Fausto Caneschi is 
currently manager in the Research Lab of Tecsiel, a STET-Finsiel 
Company.

Corrado Moiso received his degree in Computer Science at the 
University of Torino in 1984. In the same year he joined CSELT the 
telecommunications research lab of STET. In the period '84-'90 his 
research activity was on declarative languages. Since 1990 he has 
been working on the object-oriented paradigm for distributed 
processing. He is currently responsible for a research activity on 
object-oriented distributed architectures, platforms and support 
environment for telecom applications. 


TUTORIAL 15: Visualization of Object-Oriented Systems
Instructors: Chris Laffra, Wim de Pauw
             IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, USA
Level:       Intermediate
Time:        Tuesday, 5 July, 14.00-17.30

WHO SHOULD ATTEND:
Object-oriented (OO) professionals who want to learn about state-of-
the-art techniques and paradigms for visualizing object structures 
in executing, complex  OO systems to enhance their understanding, 
profiling, and debugging.

ABSTRACT:
The course shows how visualization can dramatically increase the 
understanding of the behavior of an OO program.  Most visualizations 
focus on showing "static" structures of OO programs (e.g., class 
hierarchies). We will demonstrate how dynamic visualizations of a 
C++ or Smalltalk program execution can enhance its understanding and 
provide exciting insights by applying cognitive associations. 
Visualizations can range from high-level behavior views to more 
microscopic views, showing object activity. Performance problems, 
misconceptions, or bugs that cannot be found that easily before, are 
now found, just by watching the visualizations. It will be shown how 
visualizations can be used to highlight high level communication 
patterns; first emphasizing how classes inter-relate. Then, how 
individual instances of these classes communicate. These 
communications are shown using different kinds of statistical 
instruments and record-and-playback tools. Furthermore, it is shown 
how customized visualizations can be generated using specialized, 
declarative script languages. All presentations will be done in 
parallel with running live demonstrations. Each item that is 
introduced will be immediately followed by a short example of how it 
works in reality. This enables participants to fully understand and 
appreciate the use of visual techniques for understanding and 
debugging OO programs.

Wim De Pauw and Chris Laffra are both affiliated with the IBM T.J. 
Watson Research Center. Wim is currently working on the Object 
Visualizer project, an environment for the visualization of object-
oriented programs. He was speaker at the OOPSLA'93 conference with 
the paper "Visualizing the behavior of Object-Oriented Systems", and 
will speak at ECOOP'94 with the paper "Modeling Object-Oriented 
Program Execution". Chris has developed HotWire, a visual debugger 
for C++ and Smalltalk, which he demonstrated at OOPSLA'93, where he 
also co-organized a workshop and panel on the subject. HotWire has 
also been presented at the 1994 USENIX Technical C++ Conference.

* WORKSHOP  DESCRIPTION *
************************

Workshop 1:    Patterns 
Organizers:    Frank Buschmann, Siemens AG
               Wolfgang Pree, University of Linz
Time:          Monday, July 4, 9.00-17.30

Patterns recently emerged in the OO community as a vehicle to 
describe "good" OO-design avoiding the necessity to reveal 
implementation details. Patterns identify, name, and abstract a 
common structural or behavioural  principle by describing its 
different parts, their collaboration and responsibilities. A number 
of questions has been raised in connection with patterns:
   * What are patterns?
   * What is their exact purpose?
   * How to categorize them?
   * What is the appropriate notation for patterns?
   * What are their implications to methodology?
This workshop tries to explore some of these issues by presentations 
and discussions on:
   * Definition and Categorization of patterns
   * Phases and activities of software development related to the 
     use of patterns
   * The methodological aspects of using patterns
   * A catalogue of patterns
Anyone interested in the workshop is encouraged to submit a position 
paper on the subject. For detailed information on the workshop as 
well as for guidelines for submissions please contact:

Workshop 2: 4th Workshop for Doctoral Students in Object-Oriented 
Systems 
Organizers: Arjan Loeffen, University of Utrecht,
            Mira Mezini and Thilo Kielmann, University of Siegen
Time:       Monday, July 4, 9.00-17.30

This one-day workshop intends to advance the personal and 
professional development of about 35 PhD-level students working in 
the field of object-oriented systems. The workshop will be an 
opportunity for PhD students to meet, to discuss their research, and 
to further develop their working skills. The workshop will be 
divided into three major parts: mutual introduction, technical 
program, and non-technical program. The aim of the technical program 
is to exchange ideas on topics selected  in advance by the 
participants. The non-technical program will be concerned with 
conducting and organizing research in our rapidly evolving field. 
The discussion of these topics will be supported by a talk of an 
experienced researcher in the field (to be named).

Workshop 3: Frameworks for Graphics Editors 
Organizers: Ralph Johnson, University of Illinois at

            John Vlissides,  IBM T.J. Watson Research Lab
Time:       Monday, July 4, 9.00-17.30

Graphics editors are needed for CASE tools, for interfaces to 
simulations, for CAD, and for nearly any application that presents 
information using pictures. A framework for graphics editors makes 
it possible to quickly develop a specialized graphics editor for a 
particular application. There are now several different frameworks 
for graphics editors. We will compare and contrast the frameworks we 
have seen or built, develop a taxonomy for them, determine the main 
design issues, and explore the variety of solutions that people have 
invented for the various problems that we all encounter. The ideal 
participant is responsible for developing a graphics editor 
framework, though users of such frameworks are also welcome to 
participate. Potential participants should submit a description of 
their framework (preferably electronically) to:

Workshop 4: Logical Foundations of Object-Oriented Programming
Organizers: Jean-Marc Andreoli,  Rank Xerox Research Center 
            Vijay Saraswat, Xerox Palo-Alto
Time:       Monday, July 4, 9.00-17.30

This workshop aims to establish the state-of-the-art in the use of 
logic for/in Object-Oriented Programming particularly in the light 
of recent developments in computational use of logic (sub-structural 
logics, constraints). The workshop will focus on the usefulness of 
logic and constraints for modeling object systems and reasoning 
about OO programs (e.g. type- and effect-inferencing techniques), on 
integrating and enhancing traditional OOP concepts (e.g.  
encapsulation, inheritance, overriding, message passing, 
synchronization), and for understanding computational ideas that OOP 
has traditionally had difficulty with (e.g. real-time, aggregation, 
constraints). Contributions (e-mail submissions preferred) should be 
concerned with foundational issues (e.g., use of sub-structural 
logics), practice (e.g., real-time systems) and new insights aimed 
at enhancing our basic understanding of OOP.

Workshop 5: Economic Impact of Object-Oriented and Reuse Based 
            Methodologies 
Organizer:  Giancarlo Succi, University of Genova
Time:       Monday, July 4, 9.00-17.30

Object-Orientedness and Reusability have been emerging for  the last 
few years as two of the hottest research fields in software 
engineering, furthermore each of them seems to imply the other.  
Several research efforts are ongoing, standards are being defined 
and the first commercial products are emerging.  However there is  a 
current debate  about the  impact of these methodologies on 
industries, software houses and research institutes, and about their 
real economic advantages. The aim of this is to discuss in an 
informal and sincere environment their researches, their experiences 
and their plans in these fields. Positive and especially negative 
experiences are particularly sought.

Workshop 6: Common Elements for Object-Oriented Programming Systems 
Organizer:  Kurt Geihs, University of Frankfurt
Time:       Tuesday,  July 5, 14.00-17.30

Although the object model is widely accepted in many areas of 
computer science as a solid base for building information processing 
systems, the actual research and development takes place in a rather 
isolated fashion.  There is little "inter-operability" between 
disciplines. This workshop brings together researchers and 
developers from different areas of computer science that work on 
object systems. The aim of the workshop is to encourage and 
facilitate the inter-disciplinary discussion of what is needed as a 
common foundation. Attempts have been made to define such common 
elements. We need to discuss whether those attempts are sufficient 
and what kinds of new requirements are introduced by the rapid 
technological progress.

Workshop 7: Use of Object-Oriented Technology for Network Design 
            and Management 
Organizer:  Michel Dao, France Telecom 
Time:       Tuesday,  July 5, 9.00-17.30

Telecommunications networks are complex dynamic structures whose 
design and management require advanced software development methods 
and techniques, very likely to benefit from OO technology. The 
purpose of this workshop is therefore to bring together people who 
have carried out advanced OO applications in that domain, in order 
to have a survey of the existing realisations or experiments, and 
try to give an insight into future research. We welcome 
contributions concerning any OO topics that are relevant to 
networks, including (but not limited to) the following:
   * object-based knowledge representation;
   * OO recommendations for network management;
   * OO analysis, specification and design;
   * OO implementation of design algorithms;
   * concurrent and/or distributed OO implementations;
   * OO and distributed databases;
   * OO interactive and graphical interfaces;
   * OO simulation.
The workshop is also intended to be a challenge to evaluate the 
advantages and disadvantages of OO technology for the areas of 
network design and management, and more precisely its ability to 
bridge the gap between different activities of a same domain (e.g. 
for telecommunications networks: network modeling vs. algorithms 
implementation, network design vs. network management, etc.).

Workshop 8: System Implementors' Workshop
Organizers: Peter Dickman, University of Glasgow
            Eric Jul, University of Copenhagen
Time:       Tuesday,  July 5, 9.00-17.30

This workshop will bring together those who have previously built, 
or are currently implementing, an object support system. This may be 
an operating system designed to support objects, the run-time system 
for an OO language, a distributed object-support layer or any 
similar entity. The systems may be commercial or research platforms, 
but should not be purely paper designs. The aim is to provide a 
forum in which trade-offs and significant problems can be discussed 
by those with practical experience in the area. Potential attendees 
will be asked to submit (by 30/4/94) a two page position statement 
presenting one issue, problem, or solution, which they wish to 
discuss. Each session will address a single topic raised by the 
participants and the bulk of the available time will be spent in 
structured discussions. For further information (including a more

Workshop 9: Models and Languages for Coordination of Parallelism and 
            Distribution
Organizers: Paolo Ciancarini, University of Bologna
            Oscar Nierstrasz, University of Geneva
            Akinori Yonezawa, University of Tokyo
Time:       Tuesday,  July 5, 9.00-17.30

A new class of models, formalisms, and mechanisms for describing 
concurrent and distributed computations has emerged in the past few 
years. Some significant representatives in this new class are Gamma, 
Linda, Swarm, Linear Objects, ACL, PoliS, and ActorSpaces. All these 
models and languages share a few basic concepts: simple features for 
describing data and a small number of mechanisms for coordinating 
the work of agents in a distributed/parallel setting. Integrating 
such features with those offered by concurrent OOP may lead to a 
significant step ahead in the state-of-the-art of language support 
for distribution and parallelism. The intent of this workshop is to 
bring together people interested in coordination language design, 
abstract models for coordination, and coordination mechanisms for 
distributed operating systems, and who are engaged in or interested 
in related research. Deadline for submission of papers: May 2. 
Notification for acceptance/rejection: June 1.

AI has contributed to OO.  For example, frames for knowledge 
representation have contributed to the object notion.  Moreover, 
software engineering has been an enduring interest in the AI 
community. Therefore, the application of AI technology especially to 
OO software engineering is very promising.  This workshop shall 
provide a forum to discuss open questions, to present work done, and 
to establish future collaborations and mutual insemination of AI 
techniques and OO software development. Its objective is to foster 
impact from AI onto OO software engineering. Every useful 
contribution to apply AI technology to object-oriented software 
engineering is welcome.

* ECOOP'94 TECHNICAL PROGRAM *
********************************

The past ten years have seen object-oriented technology make a major 
impact on the software industry; it is not going too far to say that 
nowadays the notion of object-orientation is revolutionizing all 
aspects of the software lifecycle. Success on the practical side has 
gone in parallel with continuous scientific growth, so that the 
field, far from having settled into quiescence, is still 
characterized by a tumultuous vitality of novel directions and 
developments. The technical programme of ECOOP'94 testifies this 
well, with 25 papers, selected from 161 which were submitted, 
covering as wide a range of topics as programming language issues, 
databases, analysis, design and reuse, both in the form of research 
contributions and of experience reports. Invited talks and panels 
provide further insight into the state of the art of OO technology, 
by pointing the way to future evolutions and by allowing cross-
fertilization of ideas with related disciplines.

ECOOP'94 Panels
--------------

At this year conference we will have two panel discussions. 
The first (Distributed Object-Oriented Applications: Academic vs. 
Industry Solutions) will try to contrast two approaches to 
distributed Object-Oriented applications: the "academic" way of 
using distributed OO languages, characterized by (more  or less) 
homogeneity, object mobility, and a single distributed workspace, 
and the emerging "industrial" solution with much more coarse-grained 
objects but (kind of) openness and heterogeneity.
The second panel (Open Implementation: are Black Boxes Dead?) will 
debate on the proposition that black-box abstraction (implementation 
hiding) itself is at the root of many of the complexity problems we 
see in todays applications. It should (and is) being replaced by a 
model in which systems allow clients principled control over their 
implementation. It is claimed that OO would play a chief role in 
achieving such 'disciplined openness' (e.g., the CLOS Metaobject 
Protocol), but on the other hand there are claims that OO 'as is' is 
still insufficient and refinements as well as enhancements are 
required.  The panel investigates whether 'Open Implementation' is 
really the way of the future as well as how OO should interplay with 
the paradigm.

BEYOND OBJECTS

Luc Steels
VUB AI Lab.
Brussels, Belgium.

The paper reports on progress towards reusability and the 
configuration of applications by (non-)programmers. The key idea is 
to go beyond the level of code, even if it is object-oriented, and 
introduce a still higher level of abstraction which balances three 
perspectives: tasks, objects, and methods. We have developed a 
formal descriptive framework for this level based on feature 
structures, and have shown how code can be automatically generated. 
We have also demonstrated already the feasibility of isolating 
fragments (consisting of code + its formal description)which can 
then be incorporated in new applications by cut and paste 
operations. Some scenarios of application configuration and 
reusability illustrate the paper. The role of reflection and meta-
level architectures will be emphasised.

Luc Steels studied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at 
MIT and Languages and Philosophy at the University of Antwerp. He is 
currently Professor of Computer Science and director of the 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Brussels 
(VUB). Steels has been active in natural language processing, 
knowledge representation, object-oriented programming, knowledge 
engineering, and robotics. His recent research focuses on the use of 
notions of complexity (self-organisation, chaotic dynamics, emergent 
functionality) for the design of autonomous robotic agents. Most 
relevant for the object-oriented programming community is the work 
with his team at the VUB on a framework for the reuse of information 
and knowledge and the configuration of applications by non-
programmers. This research has lead to the KREST workbench which has 
a growing user community throughout Europe.


PUTTING OBJECTS TO WORK:
HYPERMEDIA AS THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE MEDIUM
FOR COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK

Norbert A. Streitz
Integrated Publication and Information Systems Institute (IPSI)
National Research Center for Computer Science (GMD)
Darmstadt, Germany

One can observe the following parallel developments: an increasing 
merge of computer, network and telecommunication technology, new 
needs and markets in the information and media industry, indications 
of changes in the way people use information in their work and in 
their home environments. A common factor is the digitalization of 
information at the time it is processed or even better when it is 
created. But the progress in networks and basic technology is not 
paralleled to the same degree by advances in the development of 
corresponding applications which - in the end - are necessary to 
justify the immense investments, e.g. in information super highways. 
One important class of applications is the area of supporting 
synchronous and asynchronous cooperation of spatially distributed 
people working with information objects which can be shared in 
various ways. This results in tele-cooperation complemented by 
audio/video communication channels providing telepresence. We 
propose that "hypermedia" serve not only as the "subject matter" of 
cooperation, e.g. planning, editing, and reviewing a hypermedia 
document, but also a "medium" for coordination, communication, and 
cooperation by using specific object types and exploiting their 
properties. Hypermedia can be considered as "networked multimedia 
documents" in the sense that they represent networks of information 
objects (typed nodes and links with multimedia content) but also in 
the sense that the information objects are geographically 
distributed over a physical network in many locations. In order to 
provide examples of how one can support telecooperation, we will 
present the design and implementation of two group aware 
applications which were developed using an object-oriented approach: 
SEPIA - a cooperative hypermedia authoring environment for remote 
collaboration, and DOLPHIN - an electronic meeting room support 
system using an interactive electronic whiteboard being networked 
with local notebook computers and remote desk top workstations.

Norbert A. Streitz is the Deputy Director of GMD-IPSI of the German 
National Research Center for Computer Science. At IPSI, he is also 
the manager of the research division "Cooperative Hypermedia 
Systems". He is an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on 
Information Systems (TOIS) and was the Vice Chair (Europe) of ACM 
SIGLINK from 1991-1993. He has been a program committee chair and 
member of national and international conferences in the areas of 
hypermedia, computer-supported cooperative work, human-computer 
interaction, systems design, knowledge representation. He is 
lecturing in these areas at the Technical University of Darmstadt, 
at tutorials connected to conferences and in seminars for industry.

* GENERAL INFORMATION *
***********************
 
Location
--------
ECOOP 94 main conference (together with exhibition and  
demonstrations) will  be held from July 6 to July 8 at "Palazzo 
della Cultura e dei  Congressi"  (Piazza della  Costituzione 5/C), 
while workshops and tutorials from July 4 to July  5 at  the Faculty 
of Engineering of the University of Bologna (Viale Risorgimento 2). 

Situated on the southern edge of the "Pianura Padana", on the lower  
slopes of the Apennine foothills, Bologna, the chief town of Emilia- 
Romagna, is a  city of many faces: its numerous medieval towers, its 
churches, its long  arcaded streets lined by sumptuous 14C to 17C 
palaces recall the former  political  and cultural importance of 
this once independent city. Bologna is  famous  for  its University, 
the oldest in the western world, which already  numbered  10000  
students in the 13th Century. In addition to being an Italian 
gastronomic centre, Bologna is an  important industrial and 
commercial town well-placed on both the national rail  and  road 
networks. The city hosts numerous international fairs, shows and  
exhibitions.

Climate
-------
During July the climate is hot. The temperature is between 25 and 30 
centigrade degrees and the weather is generally sunny.  

Travel to Bologna
-----------------
Bologna can be reached directly by plane from Barcelona, Brussels,  
Frankfurt, London, Munich, Nice, Paris, Rome and Milan. Its airport 
is 6 km north-west of the city centre, and can be easily  reached  
in 20 minutes by bus (about 1300 ITL) or in 10 minutes by taxi  
(about 20000  ITL).   

Bologna is the most important railway centre in Italy: the main  
cities of  Europe are directly connected with Bologna. If you arrive 
by plane  at Milan  or Rome, the train schedule between these cities 
and Bologna is very  dense  (about a train every hour). It takes 
about 3.30h from Rome and 2h  from  Milan. The railway station is 
very close to the center of the city,  and can  be reached in 10 
minutes on foot or in few minutes by bus.

If you plan to arrive to Bologna by car, the city lies next to A-1  
(Milan- Bologna), A-13 (Bologna-Padova) and A-22 (Modena-Brennero)  
motorways.

Many car rental companies are present both at the airport and at the 
railway station.
