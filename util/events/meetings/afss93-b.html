                  CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

       FIRST ASIAN FUZZY SYSTEMS SYMPOSIUM '93 EXHIBITION

In conjunction with the First Asian Fuzzy Systems Symposium '93, a
Product Exhibition will exhibit state-of-the art or
state-of-the-practice commercial tools and environments, pre-released
product prototypes and advanced academic research prototypes.  The
exhibition consists of two main activities,namely the product
exhibition and product presentations.  The venue of the exhibition
will be in the same location where the main events take place.  The
schedule of the exhibition is well integrated to the main event to
maximise audience participation.  The tutorial and workshop
participants will have the opportunities to see the demonstrations,
hands-on evaluation, and listen to the presentations on how the tools
could improve your software development effort. 

As AFSS '93 participants are professionals experienced in the
research, development or application of Fuzzy Systems, the product
exhibitors will benefit from participating in such an event to reach
out to the right type of audience and potential customers who are here
just for AFSS.  The total number of attendance for the symposium is
expected to be between 100 to 120, and the number for the tutorials is
about 100.
