A problem in the process of building knowledge-based systems is
acquiring and modeling appropriate problem-solving knowledge. The
objective of this workshop is to assemble theoreticians and
practitioners of AI who recognize the need for developing methods
and systems that assist the knowledge acquisition process.

A major goal of the workshop is to encourage vigorous interaction
and exchange of idea. Consequently, the workshop participation will
be kept small - about 50 participants. Persons not submitting
papers can also request to participate. Authors are invited to
formulate an issue that would be useful to discuss. Software
demonstrations related to presented papers are also encouraged.
Best paper awards are available for foreign students to cover a
part of their travel expenses (100,000 yen/person). 

Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of knowledge
acquisition for knowledge-based systems, including (but not
restricted to):

 o Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modeling
 o Tools and techniques for knowledge modeling
 o Tools and techniques for sustained knowledge acquisition,
   knowledge refinement and knowledge validation
 o Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge
   acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge
   engineering
 o Integration of knowledge acquisition and machine learning
 o Integration of knowledge acquisition techniques within a single
   system; integration of knowledge acquisition systems with other
   systems (hypermedia, database management systems, simulators,
   spreadsheets ...)
 o Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge and
   knowledge models

Five copies of a draft paper (up to 20 pages) should be sent to
Riichiro Mizoguchi (see the address below) before May 31, 1994.
Acceptance notices will be mailed by August 31, 1994. Camera-ready

proceedings will be published and distributed at the workshop.

             	    Call for Papers

                        JKAW94
The Third Japanese Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge-Based
Systems  Workshop

      	             Sponsored by
      Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence 

      	             Supported by
       Advanced Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd.
 
                  In Cooperation with
      American Association for Artificial Intelligence
      Information Processing Society of Japan
      Japan Society for Software Science and Technology
      The Australian Computer Society
      The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication
      Engineers

                     Venue & Date
    Advanced Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd. (Hatoyama)
                  November 7 - 9, 1994

A problem in the process of building knowledge-based systems is
acquiring and modeling appropriate problem-solving knowledge. The
objective of this workshop is to assemble theoreticians and
practitioners of AI who recognize the need for developing methods
and systems that assist the knowledge acquisition process.

A major goal of the workshop is to encourage vigorous interaction
and exchange of idea. Consequently, the workshop participation will
be kept small - about 50 participants. Persons not submitting
papers can also request to participate. Authors are invited to
formulate an issue that would be useful to discuss. Software
demonstrations related to presented papers are also encouraged.
Best paper awards are available for foreign students to cover a
part of their travel expenses (100,000 yen/person). 

Papers are invited for consideration in all aspects of knowledge
acquisition for knowledge-based systems, including (but not
restricted to):

 o Languages and frameworks for knowledge and knowledge modeling
 o Tools and techniques for knowledge modeling
 o Tools and techniques for sustained knowledge acquisition,
   knowledge refinement and knowledge validation
 o Fundamental views on knowledge that affect the knowledge
   acquisition process and the use of knowledge in knowledge
   engineering
 o Integration of knowledge acquisition and machine learning
 o Integration of knowledge acquisition techniques within a single
   system; integration of knowledge acquisition systems with other
   systems (hypermedia, database management systems, simulators,
   spreadsheets ...)
 o Methods and techniques for sharing and reusing knowledge and
   knowledge models

Five copies of a draft paper (up to 20 pages) should be sent to
Riichiro Mizoguchi (see the address below) before May 31, 1994.
Acceptance notices will be mailed by August 31, 1994. Camera-ready
copies should be returned before October 10, 1994. The
proceedings will be published and distributed at the workshop.
