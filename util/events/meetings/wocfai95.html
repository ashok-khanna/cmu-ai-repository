The World Conference on the Fundamentals of AI is an international forum for
scientific exchange and presentation of fundamental research in AI. The search
for clear conceptual foundations for AI has acquired a certain urgency and the
time is ripe for major theoretical advances. The Conference is designed to
cover the theoretical aspects of all subfields of AI. The objective of WOCFAI
95 is to draw together research workers (AI scientists, cognitive scientists,
mathematicians, logicians, philosophers, linguists, .) whether from "symbolic",
"connectionist" or other sides, involved in fundamental aspects of AI or a
neighbouring domain. The second WOCFAI will be held in downtown Paris.

                    *** Submission of papers ***

You are invited to submit an original research paper devoted to the fundamental
aspects of any of the following subjects: Epistemology, Philosophy of AI; AI
and Cognitive Science; Logical and Mathematical Models for AI; Connectionist
and PDP Models for AI; Knowledge Representation, Automated Reasoning;
Planning; Learning.

Authors are requested to submit 5 copies of a paper describing, in English,
completed or on-going research not exceeding 12 pages of single-spaced text.
The first page must contain : title of paper, author's name(s), contact address
(including fax number and e-mail) abstract (300 words), list of up to 5 key
words. Submitted papers must be unpublished, substantively different from
