				SCOPE
OOIS'94 is an International Conference on Object-Oriented Information Systems,
to be held on 19-21 December 1994, at South Bank University. The theme of the 
Conference is "Object Technology for the 21st Century". The aim is to 
highlight contributions from leading researchers and engineers who are working
on object technology and its application to information systems design and 
development. The conference will feature an academic stream and an industrial
stream.  
The academic stream will have its emphasis on the novelty and significance of 
object-oriented concepts and principles. The industrial stream will feature 
contributions which report successful industrial and commercial applications. 
Object-oriented techniques are an emerging field which is having a tremendous 
impact on information system design. Because of the evolving nature on this 
new field, the scope of OOIS'94 will be wide. Topics of interest to the 
conference include: 
% Concepts and Methodology 		% Data Modelling 
% Database Management Systems 		% Decision Support Systems
