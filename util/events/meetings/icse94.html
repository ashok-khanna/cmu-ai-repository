 		RESEARCH ISSUES IN THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN
              SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

               A two-day workshop held in conjunction with
        the 16th International Conference on Software Engineering
 
		     Sorrento, Italy, May 16-17, 1994

The purpose of this workshop is to make a realistic assessment of
the availability and applicability of AI techniques to address critical
Software Engineering problems in understanding, developing and
maintaining complex software systems. The assessment will be done through
a set of industry-submitted problems drawn from real world contexts.
One or more of these problems will become workshop case studies that will be 
matched to potential AI technologies. The goal of the workshop is to use this 
matching process to (1) make an honest assessment of the state of the art of 
AI&SE, and (2) identify areas for improvement. In general, we wish to find 
collaborative projects in which AI types and practicing software engineers work together on a problem, perhaps analyzing some old dusty code, or perhaps working
through some real requirements, or perhaps doing a domain analysis.
We anticipate that the outcome of the workshop will be an increased awareness of
SE problems on the part of AI researchers, an increased awareness of the current
potential for AI technology, the identification of new avenues for research,
and suggestions for how AI research can be fruitfully coupled to
real-world SE problems. The workshop will be two days long, 
immediately preceding ICSE-16, at the ICSE hotel in Sorrento, Italy.
Results from the workshop will be presented during a special session 
of ICSE-16.


BACKGROUND

Awareness of SE problems has grown within the research community, along with
the perception that they are both interesting and applicable to AI technology.
At the same time, work in AI has become more applications-oriented and a number
of research groups have made progress in prototype systems relevant to SE. This
trend is reflected in a number of recent workshops in the areas of AI and SE.
However, these workshops have tended to emphasize the AI component of this
joint area, have usually been held in conjunction with AI Conferences, and have
often under-represented the SE community.

This workshop is an attempt to better balance the field by engaging both 
Software Engineers and Artificial Intelligence researchers in an in-depth look
at the intersection of these two vibrant areas of research and practical
problems. In particular, we hope to draw attendees from two general groups. 
The first group might be called "Potential AI users" - industry groups with SE
problems that they believe could benefit from AI technology. Attendees from
this group will be invited to submit SE problems grounded,
as much as possible, in the real-world situation in which they arose.  The
second group might be called "AI providers" - research groups working in
the area of AI and SE or traditional AI researchers whom can make a strong
case that their technology is applicable to SE. This group will be asked to
present and discuss their technology and research results in the context of
the real-world problems provided by the first group.


SUBMISSIONS

- From "Potential AI users": submit (1) an SE problem your organization is 
concerned with (e.g., version management, requirements engineering, 
verification, validation and testing), and (2) the real-world context that 
this problem arose in. We are looking for a wide range of application areas 
and problems; particular submitters may be invited to expand their problem 
into a case study description for detailed examination at the Workshop.

- From "AI providers": submit (1) a description of your research, and (2) its
potential to address a practical SE problem. While keeping the description
relatively short, please give sufficient detail so that your work can be
matched to an appropriate case study. For more theoretical AI work, you
must make a strong and specific case that your technology is potentially
applicable to a specific SE problem area.

- From "pre-matched pairs": if an AI user group and an AI provider group
have previously collaborated and have results to report (either positive
or negative), we encourage them to jointly submit a (1) description of the
problem, (2) the AI approach, and (3) the results. We expect each party in
the collaboration to contribute to the submission.

All types of submission are due by December 15, 1993. Electronic
submissions are acceptable. Send your submissions to the first co-chair
listed below.


WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION

Once submissions from groups are received, two things will happen.
First, a set of problems will be selected for inclusion as case studies
at the workshop. We will solicit more detail about these problems from
their submitters and a packet of case studies will be distributed to the
attendees. Second, a set of AI providers will be assigned to each problem.
Both industry and AI representatives will be asked to make a workshop 
presentation that relates their interest in the corresponding case study. 
It is anticipated that this presentation will be worked on jointly through 
electronic mail prior to the Workshop.

At the workshop itself, each case study will be briefly described and then
followed by selected presentations from representatives of the linked software
engineering and AI groups, with ample time for open discussion. We also 
anticipate possible panel discussions on common themes and a summary open 
session for discussion of future research directions and collaboration 
opportunities.

Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction have much to do
with each other, but their respective research communities typically
have little interaction.  The purpose of this workshop is to explore
the intersections of these areas, determining what each community has
to offer the other as well as to identify and address open problems of
mutual interest.   We hope to not only assess the state of the art in 
relevant sub-areas, but to also develop the nucleus of a research 
agenda that spans both communities. The workshop will be two days long, 
immediately preceding ICSE 16, at the ICSE hotel in Sorrento, Italy.
Results from the workshop will be presented during a special session
of ICSE-16.

Position papers, between 1 and 3 camera-ready pages in length, addressing 
relevant topics, such as those listed below, are invited.  
Accepted papers will be distributed to the workshop participants at
the meeting.  Some of the position papers may be selected for expansion
and later publication, along with several invited papers, in the actual
workshop proceedings, which will appear after the meeting.  The goal of 
the workshop is to have discussions, however, and not paper presentations.

Position paper submission deadline:       December 15, 1993
Date of notification of acceptance:       January 31, 1994
Final version of position papers due:     April 1, 1994

Topics of Interest (not limited to):

Cost drivers
  What fraction of software engineering costs are attributable to user
    interface concerns?  (E.g. determining the user's requirements on the
    interface, designing the interface, coding the interface.)
  What factors have the greatest effect on cost?

Current products
  Hundreds of commercial products are directed at solving
    user interface problems.  What kinds of tools have recognized value?
    What problems are unaddressed by current commercial offerings?

Prototyping
  Prototyping is a major risk-reduction technique.  To what extent can
    user interface issues be addressed through prototyping?  What techniques
    are most effective, or needed, for supporting the prototyping of
    user interface software?

Requirements
  How can user's requirements for user interfaces be most effectively
    ascertained or developed?  How can changes to requirements specifications,
    or modifications to requirements be most effectively handled?

Formal methods and specifications
  What role does the formal specification of user interfaces have in
    their development processes?  Are formal specifications more or less
    useful in this domain than in other software engineering domains?

Testing and Evaluation
  How can user interfaces, especially those involving substantial graphics,
    multi-media, and multi-modal techniques, be effectively tested?  What 
    are the requirements for the testing of user interface software? What
    techniques for UI software testing are appropriate?

Design and development processes and tools
  What processes are most effective for the development of user interface
    software?  What metrics are most appropriate for assessing UI design
    processes?  Would formalization and software environment support help
    the development of user interfaces?  

Architectures
    What capabilities should a user interface development system provide?  
    How should a UIDS be constructed so that it can be integrated with a 
    development process?  What tools should be provided for supporting
    task modeling and user modeling?

User interface technologies and software environments
  What roles do user interface components play in software development
    environments?  How does hypertext fit into an SDE?

CHI and CSCW concerns
  What are key insights from the CHI and CSCW communities that software 
  engineers should know about?  What software engineering processes 
  are in conflict with these insights?

Toolkits 
  How could toolkits, such as Motif implementations, Xtk, and the
  Macintosh toolbox, be improved from a software engineering
  perspective?  What new challenges are presented by the need to
  support multi-media and multi-modal interfaces? How can applications
  be engineered to avoid the design traps presented by the toolkit 
  marketplace?

In 1989, a workshop was held in Napa, California.  The meeting 
brought together database and software engineering researchers, 
and resulted in lively discussions concerning
research issues of interest to both software engineering and
database researchers.  This workshop is, in a sense, meant to
be a sequel to the Napa Workshop.  We hope to not only assess
the state of the art in this research specialty, but to also
develop the nucleus of a research agenda that spans both
communities. The workshop will be two days long,
immediately preceding ICSE-16, at the ICSE hotel in Sorrento, Italy.
Results from the workshop will be presented during a special session
of ICSE-16.

Attendance at the workshop will be by invitation only; interested
researchers must submit a 1000 to 3000 word position paper to the Organizing
Committee Chairs. (Please, no papers longer than 3000 words, including figures
and references.)  Attendance will be limited; the goal is to have
discussions, and not paper presentations.

There will be a proceedings published.  It will include the position
papers, as well as brief reports written by the committee and selected
workshop participants.  The goal of the reports will be to isolate
specific areas of common interest between software engineering
and database researchers, and to suggest critical and promising topics
of research.

TOPICS OF INTEREST (not limited to):

- Databases for supporting the implementation of software environments.
- Actual, running applications of database technology to software engineering.
- Descriptions of on-going collaborations among database researchers,
  software engineering researchers, and practitioners.
- Software environment and database interoperability.
- The application of rule databases and object bases to software environments.
- Requirements for software environment databases.
- Analysis by software engineers of the usefulness of the current object-
  oriented prototypes and products.
- Extended transaction models for environments.
- Mediating between databases and file-oriented tools.
