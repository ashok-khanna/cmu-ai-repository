Tutorial #2     Distributed Object Management
1:00 - 5:00     Tamer Ozsu, University of Alberta


  Distribution and object-orientation are commonly expected to be
  important features of next generation database management systems
  (DBMSs). Research on distributed DBMSs during the past decade has
  already had an impact on commercial products today.  Although research
  into object-oriented data management systems is more recent and less
  mature, second generation systems have started to appear. The
  synthesis of these two technologies is essential since applications
  that require object-oriented technology typically arise in distributed
  environments.
  
  In this tutorial we highlight the research issues that need to be
  addressed for successful development of distributed object management
  technology. The topics that are covered include system architecture,
  object models, object management techniques, query optimization,
  transaction management and concurrency control, interoperability,
  and the standardization efforts.
  
  
  Dr. M. Tamer Ozsu is an Associate Professor of Computing Science at
  the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada) where he leads a research
  group that investigates distributed database, distributed
  object-oriented databases and distributed database operating system
  design issues. He holds BS and M.S. degrees in industrial engineering
  from the Middle East Technical University, Turkey and M.Sc and Ph.D.
  degrees in computer and information science from The Ohio State
  University. He has joined University of Alberta in 1984. Between 1974
  to 1979 he had worked in industry in various positions. He spent
  1990-91 at GTE Laboratories (Waltham, Massachusetts) as a visiting
  scientist working on distributed object management issues.
  
  Dr. Ozsu is the author or co-author of two books, including Principles
  of Distributed Database Systems published by Prentice-Hall (1991) and
  a number of technical papers on databases and distributed systems.  He
  is on the editorial board of Distributed and Parallel Databases - An
  International Journal. He has presented technical tutorials at a
  number of international conferences in addition to tutorials and short
  courses for various institutions in Canada, USA, Mexico and Europe. He
  is a member of Computer and Information Science Grant Selection
  Committee of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council
  (NSERC) of Canada and a member of the Management Board of the Canadian
  Human Genome Project.
  
  



Tutorial #3     Architectures for High-End Transaction and Query Processing
1:00 - 5:00     Alexander Thomasian, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center


  Discuss existing and proposed architectures for On-Line Transaction
  Processing (OLTP) and Decision Supprt (DS), mainly in the form of
  read-only queries.  In each case discuss the paradigms and problem
  areas.  A comprehensive and up-to-date reading list subdivided by
  topic will be provided.

  Alexander Thomasian is a member of research staff at the IBM T. J.
  Watson Research Center.  He has also been an adjunct faculty member of
  Columbia University.  His current research interests include
  performance analysis and design issues in parallel and distributed

  several conferences.  Prior to IBM he was a faculty member at the
  University of Southern California and a senior staff scientist at
  Burroughs Corp. (now UNYSIS).  His Ph.D. degree in computer science is
  from UCLA.


Tutorial #4     Text Interpretation for Database Generation
1:00 - 5:00     Jerry Hobbs, SRI, and Lisa Rau, General Electric


  Text interpretation is that branch of natural language processing that
  concerns itself with analyzing natural language texts to extract some
  of the information they convey.  Applications of this technology
  include message routing and prioritizing, automatic database entry,
  and text retrieval.  This field has made significant advances
  recently.  We will cover the principal techniques that have been
  developed.  Among the topics covered will be pattern identification,
  statistical methods, syntax and parsing methods in relation to the
  particular problems of naturally-occurring texts, methods for making
  processing faster and more robust, reasoning about the content of
  texts for disambiguation, linking different parts of the text together
  and issues in evaluating the performance of systems.

  The discussions will be grounded in the experience of the instructors
  with large-scale text-interpretation systems.


  Jerry R. Hobbs received his Ph.D. degree from New York University and
  has taught at Yale University and the City University of New York.  He
  has been at SRI International since 1977, where he led the development
  of the Tacitus system for text interpretation.  He has done extensive
  research in discourse analysis, knowledge representation, lexical
  semantics, syntax, and parsing.

  Lisa Rau is a Computer Scientist in the Artificial Intelligence
  Laboratory of GE's Research and Development Center, where she leads
  the Natural Language Program.  Since coming to GE, she has initiated
  and led GE's research in intelligent text retrieval and partial
  parsing as implemented in the NLToolset.  Ms. Rau is the principal
  designer of SCISOR, a prototype program to extract information from a
  newswire, store it in a conceptual knowledge base and perform flexible
  retrieval.

  Ms. Rau is the author of over forty technical publications in the
  fields of natural language processing, and memory organization and
  retrieval.  Ms. Rau has served as a member of the Programme Committee
  for the R.I.A.O.  (1991) and SIGIR (1992) conferences.  She is a
  member of the advisory board for the Center for the Advanced Study of
  Information Science (CASIS).  She has given tutorials at both AAAI
  (1992) and IJCAI (1991) with Dr. Jerry Hobbs.

  In addition to leading research, Ms. Rau has directed the transfer of
  techology in text interpretation from the laboratory to GE businesses.
  The techniques employed in SCISOR are currently in use in business
  applications from field service reports on aircraft engines to news 
  categorization in information services.  Her work has been featured in 
  Popular Science and Information Week and was cited recently in the
  book ``More Future Stuff'' as ``an invention that will change your life by
  the year 2001''.

This panel will focus on the near-term future of information extraction
(IE) systems, and how that future relates to database systems.  The panel
will fulfill both informational and prescriptive roles.  On the
informational side, the panel will inform the database and knowledge base
communities about the state of the art in information extraction.  For this
purpose, the panel will answer questions such as: What types of data will
IE systems be able to recover over the next five years?  How much natural
language processing is needed for general information extraction?  What
domains are particularly amenable to IE?  How robust are today's IE
systems?

To be broadly useful, information extraction techniques will have to be
used to populate databases or knowledge bases.  This suggests that DB/KB
researchers and information extraction researchers could find important new
research directions by exploring the interplay between the two fields.
Thus, on the prescriptive side, the panel will address questions such as:
What advances need to be made in database technology to get the most out of
today's information extraction technology?  What advances in DB and in IE,
and what linkages between the two, do users of information extraction
systems want to see over the next five years?  To what recent advances in
DB technology should developers of IE technology pay particular attention?
Do IE technologies pose significant null-value problems for databases?

		  CIKM-92  INVITED TALKS AND PANELS


Gio Wiederhold, DARPA and Stanford University, "Intelligent
Integration of Diverse Information Sources"
  
  We will present the architecture of an intermediate processing layer
  for large information systems.  Tasks assigned to that layer include
  managing access to information resources as databases, knowledge
  bases, sensor-based processing systems, message processing systems,
  and systems that project into the future, as simulations can do.  To
  convert the data into information, it has to be abstracted,
  correlated, fused, and labeled with certainty factors.
  
  Mediation requires domain-specific knowledge, and we expect that there
  will be many specialized mediators, maintained by experts in their
  fields.  An application will call upon as many mediators as the
  number of domains it addresses.  Each mediator will utilize as many
  data resources as needed for its specific view.
  
  An important motivation is the structuring of knowledge maintenance,
  and, by extension, the maintenance of large information processing
  systems as well.  We will argue that longevity of large systems
  requires such an approach. The isolation from changes that an
  architecture with an intelligent layer provides is likely to be
  crucial for systems with many applications and data sources. We will
  cite some examples from a prototyping effort to insert this technology
  in a large, real and demanding application which has been initiated.
  
  
Dr. Maria Zemenkova, Database and Expert Systems Program, National
Science Foundation, "Towards Integrated Knowledge Management
Systems".
  
  Future intelligent information systems will involve large
  numbers of heterogeneous databases, information systems and
  knowledge-based systems, residing on diverse computer platforms and
  distributed over widespread networks.  For such systems to work at
  all, the interoperability problems will have to be resolved on many
  levels, both vertically and horizontally.  Currently, we are not very
  successful in integrating a given database management system with a
  expert systems for "non-toy" applications, i.e., we are not even
  successfully converting data into information and eventually
  knowledge.  However, what we would like to have is an intelligent
  cooperating system that can employ intelligent agents in finding the
  most effective solution to a myriad of problems by consulting diverse
  components of the system, collaborating on the solution, and
  presenting it in the form that best suits the user (a human being or
  another agent or a system component).  Although it is possible that we
  can get closer to realizing the ambitious goal of integrated knowledge
  management systems by making advances in the contributing core
  technologies, such as databases, artificial intelligence,
  human-computer interaction, or networking, we will need to develop
  methodologies for collaborative research for bringing the components
  together.
  
  In this talk, challenges of integrating the technologies will be
  discussed.  National Science Foundation in interested in fostering
  research relevant to integrated information and knowledge management
  systems, and the funding opportunities will be described.
  
Dr. Peter Buneman, University of Pennsylvania "Partial Information
as a Basis for Data and Knowledge Integration".
  
  In any approach to the integration of data or knowledge
  management systems the need for a theory of partial information is
  essential, for the simple reason that if any one database maintained
  "complete" information, integration would be pointless!  The study of
  partial information has been important in programming language
  research, though by a different name, for many years; and the same
  general formalism can be put to good use in data and knowledge
  integration.
  
  In particular it provides a basis for schema integration that works
  across data models and avoids a number of pitfalls of current schema
  integration techniques.  It also, at the level of data integration,
  provides extensions of -- and gives semantics for -- a number of
  common operations in relational and object-oriented query languages,
  that make it possible for such languages to be used in the presence of
  incomplete or inconsistent data.
  
  
Dr. David Waltz, Thinking Machines and Brandeis University, "Achieving a Quantum
Change in Database Usefulness".
  
Dr. Amit Sheth, Bellcore, "Multidatabase Systems: Research and Reality".
  
  Data in most large institutions are managed by heterogeneous and
  autonomous application systems and their databases.  What are the
  relevant important technical issues faced in industry?  Researchers
  have been working on issues of interoperability and integration in
  systems with multiple heterogeneous databases for about fifteen years.
  Has this research focused on the issues of importance in industrial
  computing environments?  We will give our (admittedly biased)
  perspective on these issues.  We will also propose the need to
  uniformly model information structure and semantics of individual
  information resources, work-flows requiring coordinated access to
  multiple systems, and constraints and data consistency requirements
  that span across the systems.
  
  
Dr.  Judea Pearl, UCLA, "From Numerical Probabilities to Causal Knowledge and
Practical Beliefs".
  
  This talk will survey earlier works on probabilistic reasoning
  using graphical models, discuss the prospects of eliciting causal
  knowledge from statistical data, and will conclude with recent work on
  reasoning with qualitative beliefs abstracted from probabilistic
  knowledge.
  
  
Dr. Richard Mark Soley, Object Management Group, "Consensus Standards
for Integrated Distributed Systems"
  
  Of interest for almost the entire history of computing, distributed
  systems have gained a tremendous research \& development following over
  the last ten years due to the need for integrating widely disbursed,
  multi-vendor applications, and to the growth of local-area and
  worldwide networking capabilities.  Converging with this new base of
  communications technology is a software technology uniquely suited to
  designing and building distributed systems: object technology.  The
  Object Management Group is engaged in architecting standardized
  solutions for distributed application integration in heterogeneous,
  multi-vendor, physically disparate local- and wide-area systems.  The
  OMG puts two unique requirements on specifications for its standards:
  that they be based on object technology, and that they be embodied in
  existing, commercially-available products.  Standards are then
  selected in a competitive, consensus-based fashion.
  
  Dr. Soley will present the work of the OMG, together with its past
  accomplishments and future plans, and an overview of the Object
  Management Architecture which the OMG is populating with standard
  specifications for the distributed application appliance of the
  future.

Bob Robbins, Director of Informatics, Welsh Medical Library, Johns
Hopkins University, "The Challenge of Biological Data Management: The
Human Genome Project as a Case Study".
  
  
  Biology is beginning to suffer from a data overload.  Neuroscientists are
  describing the behavior of nervous systems containing 10**18 synapses. 
  Systematists must record information on hundreds of millions of specimens
  collected from more than five million species.  Human genome researchers
  are trying to reverse engineer the 3.3 billion nucleotides that constitute
  the executable instructions for building people.  Earth-observing
  satellites will soon be spewing terabytes of ecological data every day. 
  The essential components of modern statistics (regression analysis,
  chi-square tests, and analysis of variance) were all developed to meet
  challenges posed by biologists.  The essential components of future
  data-management systems will likely also arise from attempts to meet
  biological needs.
  
  
  
Dr. Douglas B. Terry, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), "Towards
Ubiquitous, Personalized Information"
  
  Today's information delivery systems must be personalized to cater to
  individual preferences and ubiquitous to support mobile users.
  Researchers at Xerox PARC have been exploring more flexible and
  customizable means for delivering mail messages, news articles, and
  other informational documents between informal groups of people.  In
  particular, the Tapestry system permits users to filter and prioritize
  a continuous stream of on-line documents.  Per-user profiles select
  information based on its contents (full-text retrieval), attributes
  (structured queries), relationships to other information
  (conversations, hypertext), and feedback supplied by users
  (collaborative filtering).  Selected documents can be accessed from a
  variety of computing platforms including users' workstations and
  portable hand-held devices.

based Distributed Database System
  
  This talk will discuss some of the issues, chalenges and experiences
  with our efforts in making the transition from relational distributed
  database system called RAID to the Object version of Raid called
  O-RAID.  We will discuss the fragmentation, replication, reliability
  issues in addition to other database questions.  We will also discuss
  the communication facilities that we are implmenting.

PANEL: "The Future of Data Extraction from Natural Language Texts
Organizer: Jim Mayfield, University of Maryland Baltimore County
Panelists: Jerry Hobbs (SRI), Bill Schulteis (ORD), Lisa Rau (GE),
Rafael Alonso (Matsushita Information Technology Lab)
  
  This panel will focus on the near-term future of information extraction
  (IE) systems, and how that future relates to database systems.  The panel
  will fulfill both informational and prescriptive roles.  On the
  informational side, the panel will inform the database and knowledge base
  communities about the state of the art in information extraction.  For this
  purpose, the panel will answer questions such as: What types of data will
  IE systems be able to recover over the next five years?  How much natural
  language processing is needed for general information extraction?  What
  domains are particularly amenable to IE?  How robust are today's IE
  systems?
  
  To be broadly useful, information extraction techniques will have to be
  used to populate databases or knowledge bases.  This suggests that DB/KB
  researchers and information extraction researchers could find important new
  research directions by exploring the interplay between the two fields.
  Thus, on the prescriptive side, the panel will address questions such as:
  What advances need to be made in database technology to get the most out of
  today's information extraction technology?  What advances in DB and in IE,
  and what linkages between the two, do users of information extraction
  systems want to see over the next five years?  To what recent advances in
  DB technology should developers of IE technology pay particular attention?
  Do IE technologies pose significant null-value problems for databases?
  
    
PANEL: "Hybrid Approaches to the Information Access Problem
Organizer: Tim Oren, Advanced Technology Group, Apple Computers.
  
  Classic statistical methods of textual information retrieval,
  filtering, and organization have been shown to generalize well, but
  lack the ability to clearly explain their actions, and to seamlessly
  integrate a priori domain knowledge.  Knowledge engineering approaches
  to indexing and access address these problems, but may require
  extensive and expensive hand tailoring, preventing their use for many
  domains.  Neural net based methods show some potential for adapting to
  the associative behavior of individual users or groups, but share the
  limits of statistical methods.  A number of hybrid approaches have
  been proposed, using a variety of techniques to combine the strengths
  of each discipline.  This panel will explore several of these
  approaches, and encourage a debate on prospects for significant
  improvement in performance and generality.
