                      TUTORIAL ABSTRACTS
                      ------------------


"An Overview of SQL"

Jim Melton, Digital Equipment Corporation

SQL is arguably the most widely-known and -used database language in
the world; it is certainly the most widely-implemented standard
database language.  Early versions of the SQL standard were rightly
criticized for not specifying sufficient facilities required for
writing real-world applications.  The most recent revision of SQL,
SQL-92, resolves that shortcoming by defining extensive facilities for
data definition, data integrity, and advanced data manipulation.
Instead of defining a standard that is the least-common denominator of
existing products, SQL-92 challenges implementors to build relational
database systems among which meaningful applications can be freely
ported.  

The Tutorial will briefly review relational theory and the basic
concepts of SQL database technology.  The primary focus will be on the
new capabilities of SQL-92, including new data types, new relational
operators and predicates, exception reporting mechanisms, dynamic SQL
facilities, multi-session capabilities, and the self-defining
information schema.  A brief overview of the emerging SQL3 standard
and its object-oriented capabilities will also be presented.

Jim Melton is the Editor for the ANSI and ISO committees that develop
SQL standards and has co-authored the definitive text on the SQL-92
database language.  He also participates extensively in the
development of the X/Open consortium's Portability Guide for SQL and
in the SQL Access Group's activities.  Jim is a database architect for
Digital Equipment Corporation and has been especially active in
database internationalization efforts worldwide.


"Introduction to Information Retrieval"

Ed Fox, Virginia Tech

This introductory level overview of Information Access in general and
Information Retrieval (IR) in particular will prepare researchers in AI,
DBMS, and related areas to understand IR research, and to use existing and
emerging (CD-ROM, network) tools.

The tutorial will cover the fundamentals of IR including: models
(string, Boolean, vector, probabilistic and their extensions);
representation (unstructured/fields, MARC, SGML, objects); controlled
vocabularies, thesauri, indexing, analysis; ambiguity, context,
fuzziness/imprecision; matching, similarity, clustering; searching,
feedback, browsing, linking; implementation: inverted files, signature
files, n-grams; evaluation methods and experimentation.  The course
will also cover extensions to traditional IR, including: NLP (phrases,
lexicons), knowledge bases; genetic, neural net algorithms;
compression; integration with hypertext, DBMS.  Current systems for
personal use (e.g., Personal Librarian, TOPIC, ConQuest), libraries,
network access (e.g., Archie, Gopher, Mosaic, WAIS, WWW), emerging
applications for multimedia information and digital libraries, and 
recent developments from Virginia Tech research with the MARIAN and
Envision systems will also be discussed.

"User Interface Design"

Aaron Marcus, Aaron Marcus and Associates

Skillful graphic design for user interfaces of all kinds (graphical, pen-based,
virtual-reality based) is crucial to the success of innovative computer-based
products, especially as computers acquire multimedia characteristics, become
more sensitive to diverse, international user communities, and must deliver
more usable systems. Presented by a pioneer of graphic design for computer
graphics and a leader in the field of user interface design, electronic
document design, and knowledge visualization, this tutorial will give
developers, graphic designers, and users valuable insight into key graphic
design issues and show how to achieve effective visual communication and
increased usability.
 
The tutorial will introduce terminology, principles, guidelines, and heuristics
for using information-oriented, systematic graphic design in user interfaces,
especially for the design of metaphors, mental models, navigation schema,
icons, and dialogue boxes. The tutorial will benefit participants because many
current window manager and graphical user interface design tools do not provide
sufficient functions or guidance for these topics.
 
Aaron Marcus is an internationally recognized authority on graphic design for
computer graphics, especially chart, form, document, icon, and screen design.
He and his staff have designed and evaluated user interfaces, knowledge
visualization, and electronic publishing/presentations for Apple, Ashton-Tate,
Computervision, DEC, DuPont, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Kodak, MCC,
McDonnell-Douglas, Microsoft, Motorola, NCR, Pacific Bell, Reuters, Scitex, 3M,
Wavefront, and many other organizations. Government clients have included the

"Knowledge Base Management"

Vinay Chaudhri and Thodoros Topaloglou, University of Toronto

Knowledge based systems are now routinely used in thousands of ``real
world'' applications. Most such applications involve relatively small
knowledge bases, containing hundreds rather than thousands of units
(objects, rules, frames, etc.)  Developing the next generation of
knowledge based systems with knowledge bases containing hundreds of
thousands or even millions of units will require first and foremost a
technology for building, accessing and managing these large knowledge
bases. Such a technology will be founded on new implementation
techniques that extend known ones for knowledge bases and databases
and address issues of physical storage management (how does one
minimize disk I/O during the evaluation of a query), query
optimization (transforming a query to an equivalent, but simpler
expression), concurrency control (interleaving the execution of
knowledge base operations to optimize the use of computer resources),
constraint enforcement and others. Apart from such traditionally
database-oriented techniques, knowledge base management requires
new techniques, specific to knowledge bases such as ones for efficient
implementations of inference mechanisms (terminological subsumption,
deduction, induction and abduction). Moreover, knowledge base
management demands new tools for knowledge acquisition, knowledge base
validation, verification and maintenance, as well as new architectures
that accommodate a multi-user, distributed operating environment.

The tutorial aims at providing a comprehensive review on the
state-of-the-art in knowledge base management techniques and
commercial tools as well as recent research results and ongoing
projects.

The topics to be covered in the tutorial include the following:
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- The state-of-the-art in commercial products
- Physical and logical storage management
- Query processing
- Constraint enforcement and rule management
- Concurrency control
- Knowledge base management tools
