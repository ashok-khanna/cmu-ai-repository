The International Conference on Evolutionary Computation - The Third
Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN III) will be held in Jerusalem,
Israel between 9-14 October, 1994. This meeting will bring together an
international community from academia, government and industry interested
in algorithms suggested by the unifying theme of natural computation.

Natural computation is a common name for the design, theoretical and
empirical understanding of algorithms gleaned from nature.  Characteristic
for natural computation is the metaphorical use of concepts,  principles  and
mechanisms underlying natural systems.  Examples are genetic algorithms,
evolutionary programming and evolution strategies inspired by the evolutionary
processes of mutation, recombination, and natural selection in biology,
simulated annealing inspired by many-particle systems in physics, and
algorithms inspired by multi-cellular systems like neural and immune networks.

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to: evolution
strategies, evolutionary programming,  genetic algorithms and classifier
systems, other forms of evolutionary computation, simulated annealing, neural
and immune networks, machine learning and optimization using these methods,
their relations to other learning paradigms, and mathematical description of
their behaviour.

The conference programme committee will particularly welcome application
papers dealing with these techniques to solve real problems in manufacturing,
design, planning and engineering providing these are of the highest level. The
application type of papers should either exhibit outstanding performance in
solving particular problems in contrast to other techniques or address real
problems of significant and unique importance to science.

5 hard copies of original work in the related topics typed in 12pt single
column and maximal length of 10 pages including all figures and references
should be sent to H.-P. Schwefel, programme co-chair by March 1, 1994.  One
copy should contain the names of the authors, affiliation, and full addresses.
The remaining 4 copies should be anonymous and contain only the title and body
of paper including figures and references. This procedure is adopted to
enhance anonymous peer review.

The conference will be held in a kibbutz 10 minutes from the Old City of
Jerusalem on top of the Judean mountain range overlooking Bethlehem and
Jerusalem.  The conference programme will include visits to historical,
religious and contemporary monuments in Israel.


IMPORTANT DATES:

March 1, 1994 - Submission of full paper
May 30,  1994 - Notification to authors
July 1,  1994 - Submission of revised, final camera ready papers


GENERAL INFORMATION

Venue

The conference will be held at the Mitzpeh Rachel Kibbutz Congress Center on
the southern outskirts of Jerusalem, overlooking Bethlehem.  A swimming pool
and tennis courts are on the premises and there is easy access by public
transportation to the center of Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is an excellent location for an international convention. Just 40
minutes from the Ben Gurion International Airport, Jerusalem offers a variety
of cultural and religious experiences that link its historic past to its
dynamic present.

History will come alive as you discover the shrines of the world's great
religions, stroll around the walls of the Old City, visit the reconstructed
city's main streets, and enjoy the extensive collections in Jerusalem's
numerous museums that house amongst its treasures, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
Billy Rose sculpture garden, archaeological finds, calligraphy and other
works of art.

As the  birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, and as one of Islam's holy
cities, Jerusalem is a captivating, uniquely significant city to millions of
people throughout the world. The conference will offer participants an
opportunity to combine a scientific gathering with the natural beauty of a
country  that enjoys a pleasant Mediterranean climate and a unique city,
Jerusalem.


Language

The official language of the conference is English. All lectures, posters
and printed material will be in English.


Climate

The weather in October in Jerusalem is sunny and mild during the day.  The
temperature is cooler in the evenings. Some rain may be expected, but not
very likely.


Clothing

Informal for all occasions.  Do not forget to pack a swimsuit, head covering,
sunglasses and comfortable walking shoes. A jacket or sweater is recommended
for evenings.


Visas

Participants from most countries do not require entry visas. If needed, visas
will be granted to all bona fide participants provided that application to the
local representative of Israel is made at least three months before arrival in
Israel.


Social Program

A special program and excursions are planned for the participants of the
conference and their accompanying persons.


Second Announcement

Further information and the second announcement will be mailed upon request.
Please advise your colleagues who may be interested in participating in the
conference.


Travel, Tours and Accommodation

The conference committee has appointed Ortra Ltd. as the official organizer
and travel agent of the conference.  Rooms have been reserved at the Mitzpeh
Rachel hotel (conference venue). Ortra Ltd. will  offer pre/post conference
tourist services. Further information will be published in the second
announcement.


PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR INTENTION FORM NO LATER THAN JANUARY 10, 1994
