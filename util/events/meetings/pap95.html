Call for Papers/Participation:

				PAP'95

	   The Third International Conference and Exhibition
		  on Practical Applications of Prolog

		             Paris, France
		         4th - 7th April 1995

Objectives

The PAP conferences are the world's showcase for Prolog systems and
applications. Outstanding examples of fielded industrial applications
from all over the world formed the core of the two previous
conferences.

The main focus of PAP '95 will be on Prolog applications that have
shown clear benefits for industry, commerce or education.

The programme will include paper presentations, invited talks,
plenary and panel sessions, tutorials and workshops.

PAP '95 will show that Prolog is a highly effective tool for the
development and delivery of  industrial strength applications.
Sponsored by the Prolog Management Group, Compulog-Net, and the
Association for Logic Programming, the PAP'95 conference and
exhibition will provide a forum for technical exchange between all
members of the world-wide logic programming community: academics,
industrialists and Prolog systems vendors.


Call For Papers

Papers are solicited describing fielded applications written in
Prolog or other logic programming languages.
Suitable application areas include but are not limited to:

CAD and Manufacturing			Computer-Based Training
Parallel Systems			Data Processing
Graphics and Animation			Natural language
Financial Analysis			Automated Documentation
Simulation				Planning and Scheduling
Object-Oriented Systems			Application Delivery
User Interface Design Tools		Environments and Toolkits
Tools and Techniques			Knowledge-Based Systems
Deductive Database Systems       	Constraint Logic Programming
Software Engineering			Hybrid Systems


Call for Industrial Reports

Pressure of time and competing priorities mean that details of
industrial applications are often never written up as formal papers.
In recognition of this, it will be possible to submit a brief report
on a fielded application or activity.


Industrial Exhibition

The exhibition provides an opportunity for software developers to
demonstrate Prolog applications. You are invited to contact the
organiser if you wish to exhibit at the event. Please give details of
your program and appropriate hardware platforms.

In addition, if you would like to organise or participate in a
workshop or tutorial please contact the organiser.

Sponsorship

The conference is sponsored and supported by the Prolog Management
Group, Compulog Net, the ALP, and national equivalents, and
individual members of the PMG. The PMG is an international consortium
of major companies including AI International Ltd, BIM, Boeing,
Cosytec SA, Dassault, Delphia, DS Logics, ECRC, IBM, IF Computer,
Integral Solutions Ltd, IQSoft, LPA, Paralogic, Prolog Development
Center A/S, PrologIA, Quintus Corporation, SICS, and Siemens Nixdorf.

Submission Details

Two classes of submissions are solicited - full papers and industrial
reports.

Full papers should be no more than 20 pages and should include a
description of the nature and goals of the application, the software
engineering approach and techniques used, evaluation and conclusions.
There should be a discussion of field experience, including
difficulties encountered, platforms on which available, and a
one-page summary.

Industrial reports should include a description of the nature and
goals of the application or activity, and a short analysis of
techniques and achievements. Industrial reports are limited to 10
pages.

The first page should include the title of the paper, an abstract of
no more than 200 words, followed by names of authors, full postal
addresses, and e-mail addresses and fax numbers where appropriate.

Prospective authors should submit FIVE copies of the paper using A4
paper.  For uniformity of the final proceedings, the preferred
typeface is 12pt Times.

All papers should be submitted to the Conference Organiser, in hard
copy form only.


Important Dates

Submission deadline: November 11th 1994
