----- (Feel Free To Cross Post This Announcement) ----

1.0 CONFERENCE OVERVIEW: With increasing frequency, computational sciences
are being exploited as a means with which to investigate biomedical
processes at all levels of complexity; from molecular to systemic to
demographic. Computational instruments are now used, not only as exploratory
tools but also as diagnostic and prognostic tools. The appearance of high
performance computing environments has, to a great extent, removed the
problem of increasing the biological reality of the mathematical models. For
the first time in the history of the field, practical biological reality is
finally within the grasp of the biomedical modeler. Mathematical complexity
is no longer as serious an issue as speeds of computation are now of the
order necessary to allow extremely large and complex computational models to
be analyzed.  Large memory machines are now routinely available.

Additionally, high speed, efficient, highly optimized numerical algorithms
are under constant development.  As these algorithms are understood and
improved upon, many of them are transferred from software implementation to
an implementation in the hardware itself; thereby further enhancing the
available computational speed of current hardware. The purpose of this
congress is to bring together a transdisciplinary group of researchers in
medicine, public health, computer science, mathematics, nursing, veterinary
medicine, ecology, allied health, as well as numerous other disciplines, for
the purposes of examining the grand challenge problems of the next decades.

This will be a definitive meeting in that it will be the first World
Congress of its type and will be held as a follow-up to the very well
received Workshop On High Performance Computing In The Life Sciences and
Medicine held by the University of Texas System Center For High Performance
Computing in 1990.

Young scientists (graduate students, postdocs, etc.)  are encouraged to
attend and to present their work in this increasingly interesting
discipline. Funding is being solicited from NSF, NIH, DOE, Darpa, EPA, and
private foundations, as well as other sources to assist in travel support
and in the offsetting of expenses for those unable to attend otherwise.
Papers, poster presentations, tutorials, focused topic workshops, birds of a
feather groups, demonstrations, and other suggestions are also solicited.

7.0 CONFERENCE PRELIMINARY DETAILS AND ENVIRONMENT

LOCATION: Hyatt Regency Hotel, Austin, Texas, USA
DATES:    24-28 April 1994

The 1st World Congress On Computational Medicine, Public Health, and
Biotechnology will be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Austin, Texas located
in downtown Austin on the shores of Town Lake, also known as the Colorado
River. The Hyatt Regency has rooms available for the conference participants
at a special rate of $79.00/night for single or double occupancy, with a
hotel tax of 13%. The Hyatt accepts American Express, Diner's Club, Visa,
MasterCard, Carte Blanche, and Discover credit cards. This room rate will be
in effect until 9 April 1994 or until the block of rooms is full. We
recommend that you make your reservations as soon as possible. You may make
your reservations by calling (512) 477-1234 or by returning the enclosed
reservation form. Be certain to mention that you are attending the First
World Congress On Computational Medicine, Public Health, and Biotechnology
if you make your reservations by telephone.

The hotel is approximately, five miles (15 minutes from Robert Mueller
Airport). The Hyatt offers courtesy limousine service to and from the
airport between the hours of 6:00am and 11:00pm. You may call them from the
airport when you arrive. If you choose to use a taxi, expect to pay
approximately $8.00.  Automobiles may be rented, at the airport, from most
of the major car rental agencies. However, because of the downtown location
of the Congress and access to taxis and to bus service, we do not recommend
that you rent an auto unless you are planning to drive outside of the city.

Should you not be able to find an available room at the Hyatt Regency, we
have scheduled an "overflow" hotel, the Embassy Suites, which is located
directly across the street from the Hyatt Regency. If, due to travel expense
restrictions, you are unable to stay at either of these two hotels, please
contact the conference board directly and we will be more than happy to find
a hotel near the conference site that should accommodate your needs.

Austin, the state capital, is renowned for its natural hill-country beauty
and an active cultural scene.  Several hiking and jogging trails are within
walking distance of the hotel, as well as opportunities for a variety of
aquatic sports. From the Hyatt, you can "Catch a Dillo" downtown, taking a
ride on our delightful inner-city, rubber-wheeled trolley system.  In
Austin's historic downtown area, you can take a free guided tour through the
State Capitol Building, constructed in 1888. Or, you can visit the
Governor's Mansion, recognized as one of the finest examples of 19th Century
Greek Revival architecture and housing every Texas governor since 1856.
Downtown you will find the Old Bakery and Emporium, built by Swedish
immigrant Charles Lundberg in 1876 and the Sixth Street/Old Pecan Street
Historical District - a seven-block renovation of Victorian and native stone
buildings, now a National Registered Historic District containing more than
60 restaurants, clubs, and shops to enjoy. The Laguna Gloria Art Museum, the
Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery, the LBJ Library and Museum, the
Neill-Cochran Museum House, and the Texas Memorial Museum are among Austin's
finest museums.  The Umlauf Sculpture Garden, has become a major artistic
attraction. Charles Umlauf's sculptured works are placed in a variety of
elegant settings under a canopy of trees. The Zilker Gardens contains many
botanical highlights such as the Rose Garden, Oriental Garden, Garden of the
Blind, Water Garden and more.  Unique to Austin is a large population of
Mexican free-tailed bats which resides beneath the Congress Avenue Bridge.
During the month of April, the Highland Lakes Bluebonnet Trail celebrates
spring's wildflowers (a major attraction) as this self-guided tour winds
through the surrounding region of Austin and nearby towns (you will need to
rent a car for this one).

Austin offers a number of indoor shopping malls in every part of the city;
The Arboretum, Barton Creek Square, Dobie Mall, and Highland Mall, to name a
few.  Capital Metro, Austin's mass transit system, offers low cost
transportation throughout Austin. Specialty shops, offering a wide variety
of handmade crafts and merchandise crafted by native Texans, are scattered
throughout the city and surrounding areas.

Dining out in Austin, you will have choices of American, Chinese, Authentic
Mexican, Tex-Mex, Italian, Japanese, or nearly any other type of cuisine you
might wish to experience, with price ranges that will suit anyone's budget.
Live bands perform in various nightclubs around the city and at night spots
along Sixth Street, offering a range of jazz, blues, country/Western,
reggae, swing, and rock music.

Day temperatures will be in the 80-90(degrees F) range and fairly humid.
Evening temperatures have been known to drop down into the 50's (degrees F).
Cold weather is not expected so be sure to bring lightweight clothing with
you. Congress exhibitor and vendor presentations are also being planned.

8.0 CONFERENCE ENDORSEMENTS AND SPONSORSHIPS: 

Numerous potential academic sponsors have been contacted. Currently
negotiations are underway for sponsorship with SIAM, AMS, MAA, IEEE, FASEB,
and IMACS. Additionally AMA and ANA continuing medical education support is
being sought. Information will be updated regularly on the anonymous ftp
site for the conference (see above). Currently, funding has been generously
supplied by the following agencies:
