                       2ND EUROPEAN WORKSHOP ON
                   CASE-BASED REASONING (EWCBR 94)

                           November, 1994

                          Chantilly, France


                           CALL FOR PAPERS


In November, 1993, the First European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning
was hosted by the University of Kaiserslauten (Germany) at the
European Academy in Otzenhausen. The Workshop was a resounding
success, attracting over 130 participants from some 17 countries, with
papers, panels and working groups covering the major research areas of
CBR.

The Second European Workshop on CBR (EWCBR 94) will be held in the
beautiful Chateau of Montvillargene in Chantilly, some 20 km North of
Paris (near Roissy Charles De Gaulle airport). Academic and social
events will be at Chantilly, in order to allow a close interaction
between workshop participants.
Registration will be limited to 140 participants on a "first-come,
first-served" basis.


PROGRAMME:

The scientific programme will include the presentation of selected
papers, invited talks, system demonstrations as well as poster and
panel sessions.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Submissions are invited on all aspects of CBR including (but not
restricted to):

   - Indexing and Retrieval
   - Adaptation Techniques
   - Cognitive Modelling
   - Learning in CBR
   - Uses of CBR in Diagnosis, Design and Planning
   - Integrating CBR and with Other Machine Learning Techniques
   - Analogical Reasoning
   - Case-Based Knowledge Engineering
   - Innovative Applications that Use CBR technology
   - Evaluation Methodologies
   - Comparisons of CBR Systems

Submissions can be concerned with:

   - theoretical results
   - Practical and empirical results
   - Work in progress (posters)
   - System descriptions (to be demonstrated at workshop)

All submissions should be in the form of a paper (no longer than 6000
words, including references; allow 1000 words for each full page of
figures). Each paper should also include a 200 word abstract.

Five copies of submitted papers should be sent to
   Mark Keane (EWCBR 94),
   Dept. of Computer Science,

         SECOND EUROPEAN WORKSHOP ON CASE BASED REASONING
                            EWCBR'94
                  FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
 
 
 
Dear all, here are a few explanations about the organizations of
EWCBR 94 that should clarify some missunderstandings.
 
LATE REGISTRATION FEES
 
Due to popular demand (and extreme external pressure on the organising
committee), the late fee registration deadline has been postponed until
september 15th.
 
WHO SHOULD REGISTER AND PAY THE CONFERENCE FEE
 
Everyone, including speakers, but excluding the two invited speakers.
 
LIST OF ORAL PRESENTATIONS DURING THE SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS:
 
We have assumed that the first author of the paper would be doing the
presentation. Please notify us if this is not the case.
 
TERMS OF PAYMENT FOR EWCBR
 
With have already about 70 registered participants from over 15
countries, we believe that EWCBR 94 will be as much of a success as
EWCBR 93. However, several persons who have had their paper accepted
for oral presentations or posters have not yet registered. We urge you
to do so and to confirm your participation as quickly as possible. The
limit on the number of participants is strict and, if the current rate
of registration continues, we will probably close registration before
the workshop (no on-site registrations). Please, understand that we
cannot accept more participants than the conference room can hold and
we will not take any registration once we reach our limit. No
exception will be made, even for speakers, and we will not take bribes
(unless the bribe is high enough of course). In addition, your
registration will be only confirmed once we receive full payment.
Participants that do not pay their registration fee in time will have
to pay the late fee and assume the risk of the cancellation of their
registration even if they work in a large bureaucratic organisation or
in a govenment's agency. We apologise, but no exception will be made
even for french government agencies. If your organisation cannot cope
with these terms of payment, we suggest that you make an advance
payment on your own money and get your organisation to reimburse your
expenses afterward. Finally, we remind you to label your money
transfer in french francs and to pre-pay ALL BANKING EXPENSES. Several
registered participants will soon receive a request for additional
money, that range between 15$ and 35$, because they failed to so (what
counts is not how much money you have sent but how much money we
receive).
 
CHANGE OF SITE FOR THE CONFERENCE
 
Several people have also enquired about why we have changed the
location of the conference. As annonced during EWCBR 93, we initially
intended to hold the conference in a place that looked quite good on
the leaflets they had sent us.  It turned out that when we visited the
place, it was not nearly as nice as on the glossy leaflets. After
visiting several douzains of other places in the same area, we finally
decided to hold the conference in the Royaumont foundation that used
to be a monastery until the french revolution. It is really an
exceptional setting for EWCBR 94. Royaumont is a French national
monument that has been adapted to hold seminars. The food is superb,
the conference room is modern (although not as well equiped in
standard as last year's), the place is freshly repainted and the rooms
are nice. The Royaumont Foundation is primarily devoted to hosting
music festivals and cultural events but we managed to convince them
that the CBR community was composed of cultivated people... I hope my
nose will not begin to grow... Unfortunately, the Foundation cannot
accommodate more than 60 people in total in the evening so we had to
split the group into 2 for accommodations. Half of the participants
will be hosted on the conference site and the other half in a
luxurious Chateau near by. The quality of the service, of the food, of
the wine and of the accommodations is VERY HIGH in both places and,
although it is more expensive than the other place, we will be getting
much better value for the money. We hope that this clarifies any
remaining misunderstanding about why we changed the location of the
conference.
 
TRAVEL GRANTS
 
Several persons have requested travel grants. We cannot confirm any
grant at this stage. It is quite likely that we will get travel grants
for eastern countries participants, less likely for EC members and
quite unlikely for the others. However, we cannot make any commitments
at this stage and are still trying the best we can. You should thus
behave as if you do not have a grant, and if we do obtain one we will
probably notify it to you (and pay it) during the conference.
 
CONFERENCE PACKAGE
 
Finally, we have low secreterial resources. Please read and understand
what is written on the previous call for participation. The fee for
attending the conference is a global fee. The only reason why we have
split the conference fee and the accommodation fee is for tax reasons
in order to decrease the expenses for non French participants and
remove VAT on goods that are exported.  You should thus think of the
registration + accommodation fee as a whole.  Wether you intend to
sleep in the room or not, wether you intend to eat the food or not is
totally irrelevant. Please do not harrass us and ask for discounts on
the accommodation fee. We have negociated a fixed price, global
conference package that includes everything. With the exception of
industry day, WE WILL NOT TAKE REGISTRATIONS without food and
accommodations.
 
Once again, we apologise for being so strict, but please understand
that we have very limited secretarial ressources and that we have
tried kept the fee as low as possible (when taking into account regard
the exceptional quality of the conference location and food and wine).
