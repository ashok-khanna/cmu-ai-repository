		POST-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP 
 
		PROOF-THEORETICAL EXTENSIONS OF LOGIC PROGRAMMING
 
This workshop is intended to provide a forum for researchers to exchange
ideas on the influence of proof theory on the future development of the
field of logic programming.  This follows the workshops named
"Extensions of Logic Programming" since 1989. The previous workshops
were held in Tuebingen, Germany, (1989), Stockholm, Sweden, (1991), 
Bologna, Italy, (1992), St Andrews, Scotland, (1993). The 
proceedings of each has been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence series (numbers 475, 596, 660, forthcoming). The
workshop intends to bring together researchers from the two fields and
evaluate the state of the art. Given the different backgrounds required,
it may include a tutorial part besides contributed papers. 
 
We expect papers exploring (or criticizing) the fruitfulness of the
proof-theoretic approach to traditional and novel issues in logic
programming. Topics include, but are not necessarily limited to
 
     o proof-theoretic foundations
       - cut elimination 		
       - negation-as-failure
       - equational theories
       - program completion
       - reasoning by induction
       - partial inductive definitions
       - linear logic
       - constructive, modal and temporal logics
       - many-valued logics
       - higher-order logics
       - type-theoretic approaches
     
     o languages
       - Elf
       - GCLA
       - Isabelle
       - lambda Prolog
       - LO! 
       - Lolli
       - ACL 
 
    o applications
       - program synthesis, transformations and equivalence
       - program termination
       - unification theory and constraints
       - theorem proving
       - programming language implementations
       - modularity
       - knowledge representation
       
 
Organizing Committee
 
- Lars-Henrik Eriksson, Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS),
Stockholm, Sweden 
- Roy Dyckhoff, University of St Andrews, Scotland	
- Alberto Momigliano, Department of Philosophy, Carnegie Mellon University
- Mario Ornaghi, Department of Computer Science, Universita' di Milano,  Italy
 
 
Electronic submissions in LaTeX, DVI  or Postcript format of extended
abstracts (up to 5 pages) are strongly encouraged, preferably following
the Springer style. The abstracts should present work
that is original although not necessarily finished. The organizers will
select a number of the submitted extended
abstracts for presentation but other good submissions will be also
included in the informal proceedings. Please state an email address and
a fax number on your submission

International Conference on Logic Programming.
Pre-conference abstracts will be distributed to the participants.
Post-conference in-depth review of submitted papers for publication will
be considered.
