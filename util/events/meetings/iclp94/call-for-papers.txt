                       Call For Papers

          INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGIC PROGRAMMING (ICLP'94)
  
	        S. Margherita Ligure, Italy, 13-18 June 1994 

	   Sponsored by the Association of Logic Programming


Logic programming originates from the discovery that a subset of
predicate logic could be given a procedural interpretation which was
first embodied in the programming language Prolog. The unique features
of logic programming make it appealing for numerous applications in
artificial intelligence, computer-aided design and verification,
databases, and operations research as well as to explore parallel and
concurrent computing. The last two decades have witnessed substantial
developments in this field from its foundation to implementation,
applications, and the exploration of new language designs.

ICLP'94 is the eleventh international conference on logic programming
and is one of the two major annual international conferences reporting
recent research results in logic programming. The technical program
for the conference will include tutorials, invited lectures, and
presentations of refereed papers and posters. Papers are welcome on
all aspects of logic programming, including, but not limited to:

	Applications			 Language design     
	Architecture			 Natural language    
	Artificial Intelligence 	 Parallelism  
	Concurrency     		 Programming methodology 
	Constraints			 Proof theory            
	Databases			 Semantics and foundations
	Environments			 Static analysis
	Higher-order programming	 Theorem Proving
	Implementation         		 Types          


Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15 pages (including
references and figures), and must contain a cover page including the
following: a 200 word abstract, keywords, and postal and electronic
mailing addresses as well as phone numbers and fax numbers of the
responsible author. Submitted papers should not have been previously
published or being submitted to any journals or refereed conferences.
Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.  

Send SIX (6) copies of your submission by NOVEMBER 15, 1993 to

	Pascal Van Hentenryck 
	Brown University, Box 1910 
	Providence, RI 02912 (USA) 
	Email: pvh@cs.brown.edu 
	Phone: +1 401 863 76 34 
	Fax: +1 401 863 76 57 

Authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their
papers by FEBRUARY 21, 1994. Final versions of the accepted
papers must be received in camera-ready form by MARCH 15, 1994.
The proceedings will be published by MIT Press.

ICLP'94 will take place in Santa Margherita Ligure, a small town in
the Italian Riviera close to Genova, the largest city of Liguria.
Close to the conference site is the worldwide famous village of
Portofino, pearl of the Mediterranean Sea and marine natural park; not
far from Santa Margherita is also the pleasant resort area of "Cinque
Terre", consisting of five pictoresque villages on the rocky coast
which can be reached by train or boat only.
