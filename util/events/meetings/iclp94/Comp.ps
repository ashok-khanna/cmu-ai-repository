                           Call for Papers

                ICLP'94 Post-Conference Workshop on
                INTEGRATION OF DECLARATIVE PARADIGMS

                          June 17-18 1994
                   Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy


The integration of declarative paradigms and, in particular, the
integration of functional and logic programming, was an active area of
research some years ago. New models and languages were proposed and it
was shown that the new paradigm is feasible.

Recently, interest for this kind of languages has been spurred anew,
especially for what concerns efficient implementation. Currently, there
is active research in:

* Design of new programming languages accounting for a mature and
  up-to-date understanding of previously studied features meant to improve
  the expressive power of declarative languages (lazy evaluation,
  higher-order objects, types, object orientation, etc...).

* Development of efficient implementations. The proposals combine
  existing techniques from logic programming (e.g., WAM, mode analysis,
  abstract interpretation) and functional programming (e.g., graph
  reduction, strictness analysis, optimization of deterministic
  computations) as well as new techniques (e.g., combination of
  normalization and narrowing, residuation and coroutining,
  parallelization).

* Integration with other paradigms, like the inclusion of
  constraints, real-time programming, visual programming, etc.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from
different communities as well as to give the logic programming
community an idea of recent advances in the area. Hence, the workshop
may contribute to close the gap between the different communities and
create a good opportunity for exciting discussions. The workshop is
open to all topics concerned with the integration of declarative
paradigms. A non-exhaustive list is the following: language features,
semantics, execution principles, implementation issues, abstract
interpretation of integrated languages, environments for integrated
languages. We encourage communications in new implementation
techniques and novel integrations of declarative paradigms.
System demonstrations are also welcome in the case the ICLP organization
will provide adequate hardware.

SUBMISSIONS:
Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to submit
extended abstracts by March 28, 1994 to the contact address below.
Manuscripts should not exceed 5 pages. Electronic submissions
in Tex/LaTex/DVI/Postcript format are strongly encouraged.
They will be notified of acceptance/rejection by May 1, 1994.
The final version is due to May 15, 1994.
We plan to produce a technical report containing the extended
abstracts of all accepted presentations.

		FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

	"Logic and Reasoning with Neural Networks" 

		Workshop at the
International Conference on Logic Programming ICLP'94 
	Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy
		June 17 or 18, 1994


Description of the Workshop
===========================
The goal of the workshop is to initiate discussions 
and foster interaction between researchers interested 
in the use of neural networks and connectionist models 
for various aspects of logic and reasoning. 

There are a number of domains where the combination 
of neural networks and logic opens up interesting 
perspectives: 


* Methods for Reasoning

- cognitively plausible models of reasoning 
- reasoning with vague knowledge
- neural inference mechanisms
- probabilistic reasoning with neural networks 

* Knowledge Representation Aspects

- representation of non-symbolic information 
- knowledge acquisition from raw data (rule extraction) 
    with neural networks
- representation of vague knowledge
- similarity-based access to knowledge
- context-dependent retrieval of facts

* Integration of Symbolic and Neural Components 

- combining sub-symbolic and symbolic information 
- pattern recognition
- sensor fusion

* Implementation Techniques

- connectionist implementations of symbolic inference mechanisms 
- neural networks as massively parallel implementation technique 
- neural networks for learning of search heuristics 


There are at least three major aspects where a discussion 
of neural networks / connectionist models can be beneficial 
to the logic programming community at this time:

* development of reasoning techniques which are 
  closer to the way humans reason in everyday situation 

* dealing with vague knowledge, i.e. imprecise, uncertain, 
  incomplete, inconsistent information, possibly from 
  different sources and in various formats 

* efficiency improvements for symbolic inference mechanisms, 
  e.g. through adaptive learning from previously solved problems, 
  or content-oriented access to rules and facts 


Submission of Papers
====================

Prospective contributors are invited to submit papers 
or extended abstracts to the organizers by April 1, 1994. 
They will be notified about acceptance or rejection by May 1.
The final version of the papers is due June 1. 

We are planning to make the full papers accessible 
to the workshop participants in an ftp archive, 
and hand out only copies of the abstracts.
If possible, please use a text processing program 
that allows you to produce PostScript output; 
otherwise it might be difficult to print out
copies on other systems than the one you used.


Preliminary Agenda
==================


The workshop is planned for one day, the actual lenght
will depend on the number of presentations and participants. 
There will be four sessions of approximately 1 1/2 hours;
ideally, each of these sessions would concentrate on
one of the four topics mentioned in the workshop description
above. 
There will be one or two talks of approximately 30 min, 
where the essential background on the use of neural networks 
for logic and reasoning will be presented. 
The main purpose for this is to offer a brief introduction to
those attendants with little knowledge of neural networks, 
and to provide a common framework of reference for the workshop. 
Care will be taken that these presentations concentrate on 
fundamental aspects, providing an overview of the field 
rather than a detailed technical review of one
particular system or approach. 

The rest of the time slots will be used for presentations 
of submitted papers (20-30 min) with enough time for discussion. 
The final time schedule will be distributed after May 1.
The workshop will be concluded by a final discussion 
and a wrap-up of important aspects.



Important Dates
===============

Submission deadline     April 1, 1994
Notification of acceptance/rejection    May 1, 1994
Final version of papers due     June 1, 1994
Date of the workshop    June 17 or 18, 1994


Registration
============
According to the standard policy of LP post-coference workshops, 
the workshops are integrating part of the conference. 
This means that participants of the workshop are expected 
to register for the conference; there will be a small additional
fee for the workshop (probably US $40).
