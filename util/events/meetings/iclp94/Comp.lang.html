Please find enclosed the final call for papers for ICLP'94.

Concerning the yearly confusion about how hard the deadline for ICLP
submissions is, prospective authors should consider the following:

"Papers airmailed on or before November 15 and arriving before
December 1st will still be processed as being arrived in time; papers
send up to one week late and arriving before December 1st will also be
considered as submitted but will have a more rough treatment
concerning selection of reviewers and more likely to be rejected in
case of being borderline."

In other words, the announcement/rumour that the deadline is extended
has to be taken with salt: November 15 is the soft deadline, December
1st is the hard deadline.

                       Call For Papers

          INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGIC PROGRAMMING (ICLP'94)
  
	        S. Margherita Ligure, Italy, 13-18 June 1994 

	   Sponsored by the Association of Logic Programming


Logic programming originates from the discovery that a subset of
predicate logic could be given a procedural interpretation which was
first embodied in the programming language Prolog. The unique features
of logic programming make it appealing for numerous applications in
artificial intelligence, computer-aided design and verification,
databases, and operations research as well as to explore parallel and
concurrent computing. The last two decades have witnessed substantial
developments in this field from its foundation to implementation,
applications, and the exploration of new language designs.

ICLP'94 is the eleventh international conference on logic programming
and is one of the two major annual international conferences reporting
recent research results in logic programming. The technical program
for the conference will include tutorials, invited lectures, and
presentations of refereed papers and posters. Papers are welcome on
all aspects of logic programming, including, but not limited to:

	Applications			 Language design     
	Architecture			 Natural language    
	Artificial Intelligence 	 Parallelism  
	Concurrency     		 Programming methodology 
	Constraints			 Proof theory            
	Databases			 Semantics and foundations
	Environments			 Static analysis
	Higher-order programming	 Theorem Proving
	Implementation         		 Types          


Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15 pages (including
references and figures), and must contain a cover page including the
following: a 200 word abstract, keywords, and postal and electronic
mailing addresses as well as phone numbers and fax numbers of the
responsible author. Submitted papers should not have been previously
published or being submitted to any journals or refereed conferences.
Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.  

Send SIX (6) copies of your submission by NOVEMBER 15, 1993 to

	Pascal Van Hentenryck 
	Brown University, Box 1910 
	Providence, RI 02912 (USA) 
	Email: pvh@cs.brown.edu 
	Phone: +1 401 863 76 34 
	Fax: +1 401 863 76 57 

Authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their
papers by FEBRUARY 21, 1994. Final versions of the accepted
papers must be received in camera-ready form by MARCH 15, 1994.
The proceedings will be published by MIT Press.

ICLP'94 will take place in Santa Margherita Ligure, a small town in
the Italian Riviera close to Genova, the largest city of Liguria.
Close to the conference site is the worldwide famous village of
Portofino, pearl of the Mediterranean Sea and marine natural park; not
far from Santa Margherita is also the pleasant resort area of "Cinque
Terre", consisting of five pictoresque villages on the rocky coast
which can be reached by train or boat only.

                       June 13 -18, 1994

During the last couple of years a significant body of knowledge has been
accumulated providing us with a better understanding of semantic issues in
logic programming and the theory of deductive databases. In particular, the
class of perfect models for (locally) stratified logic programs and two
closely related extensions to normal, non-disjunctive, logic programs were
introduced and extensively investigated: the well-founded models and the
stable models. The problem of extending these approaches and defining a
suitable semantics for the class of disjunctive logic programs and deductive
databases turned out to be a difficult one, as evidenced by a large number
of papers and the recent book of Lobo, Minker and Rajasekar devoted to this
issue.
    Logic programs rely on a non-monotonic operator, often referred to as
negation by failure or negation by default.  The non-monotonicity of this
operator allows us to view logic programs as special non-monotonic theories
and thus makes it possible to draw from the extensive research in the area
of non-monotonic reasoning and use it as a guidance in the search for a
suitable semantics for logic programs.
    Research work aimed at better understanding of the relationships exist-
ing between logic programming (LP) and nonmonotonic formalisms (N- MF) is
mutually beneficial to both areas.  NMFs help us to determine suitable
semantics for LP and help us understand how LPs can express and compute
solutions to AI problems. Conversely, the NMFs can utilize the wide body of
knowledge already gathered about LPs and apply the existing implementations
of LPs.
    This one-day workshop is the fourth in a series of workshops held in
conjunction with Logic Programming conferences (NACLP '90, ILPS '91, and
ILPS '93) and will be concerned with all of the three aspects of Theory,
Implementation, and Applications.  Papers are welcome on all non- monotonic
aspects of logic programming, including, but not limited to:

        Abductive Extensions                  Implementations
        Applications to KR                    Inconsistency Handling
        Constructive Negation                 New Application Domains
        Disjunctive LP                        Semantics
        Epistemic Extensions                  Strong or Explicit Negation

Welcome to the International Conference on Logic Programming - 1994

Logic programming originates from the discovery that a subset of predicate
logic could be given a procedural interpretation which was first embodied
in the programming language Prolog.  The unique features of logic
programming make it appealing for numerous applications in artificial
intelligence, computer-aided design and verification, databases and
operations research as well as to explore parallel and concurrent
computing. The last two decades have witnessed substantial developments in
this field from its foundation to implementation, applications, and the
exploration of new language designs.

ICLP'94 is the eleventh international conference on logic programming and
is one of the two major annual international conferences reporting recent
research results in logic programming. Sponsored by the Association of
Logic Programming (ALP) and the Prolog Vendors Group, it has been
organized by DISI, DIST (departments of the University of Genova) and IMA
(Institute for Applied Mathematics of CNR); the CNR (National Research
Council of Italy), with its institutes and national committees, has given
a strong support to the conference.

The technical program for the conference includes 43 refereed papers
(arranged in two parallel sessions), various poster presentations and 4
invited lectures by Z. Manna (Stanford), A. Mackworth (UBC), J. Wing (CMU)
and S. Peyton Jones (Glasgow). The conference presents also 4 advanced
tutorials and an industrial session with important contributions from
people really involved in applications. The opportunities to discuss
various scientific themes during this week will be enhanced by the
organization of 12 post conference workshops on some of the most
up-to-date subjects in the field.

The opportunity to enjoy Italy and, hopefully, to have also a good time
during the conference is given by the choice of the place and by some
events scheduled as part of the social program. ICLP'94 takes place in
Santa Margherita Ligure, a small town in the Italian Riviera not far from
Genova, the largest city of Liguria. Close to the conference site is the
worldwide famous village of Portofino, pearl of the Mediterranean Sea and
marine natural park; not far from Santa Margherita is also the pleasant
resort area of "Cinque Terre", consisting of five picturesque villages on
the rocky coast which can be reached by train or boat only.

The social program includes an excursion to one of the oldest villages in
the nearby coast (S. Fruttuoso) which also can be reached by boat only.
The banquet will be held in one of the most important old building in
Genova with the possibility to visit it.

Italy is well known to be attractive from many points of view,
particularly in June, but this is not the main motivation for having for
the first time ICLP in Italy. Our Logic Programming community is one of
the largest in the world as witnessed by the GULP association (the Italian
society affiliated to ALP) and this event is the result of all the efforts
that many people have put into the development of Logic Programming and
GULP.

On behalf of all the colleagues who contribute to the organization of
ICLP'94, I welcome all participants and wish them a nice and successful
conference.  Maurizio Martelli

Workshop W1
Process-Based Parallel Logic Programming

Organizer:
        K. De Bosschere, Universiteit Gent, Belgium
	J.-M. Jacquet, University of Namur, Belgium
	A. Brogi, Universit` di Pisa, Italy

Contacts:

	Email: kdb@elis.rug.ac.be

Several process-based parallel logic programming languages (e.g.,
Delta-Prolog, CS-Prolog, Multi-Prolog and Shared-Prolog) have been
proposed as an alternative to goal-based (and/or) parallel execution
models for logic programs.  The main features of these languages are
explicit process creation and explicit communication based on channels or
blackboards.  The workshop is aimed at being a forum for discussing the
various topics of process-based parallel LP, ranging from theory to
practice.

Workshop W2
Verification and Analysis of (Concurrent) Logic Languages

Organizer:
        F.S. de Boer, Free University Amsterdam,
	The Netherlands
	M. Gabbrielli, Universit` di Pisa

Contacts:
        Frank S. de Boer
	Free University
	de Boelelaan 1081
	1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands
	E-mail: frankb@cs.vu.nl

This workshop aims at a discussion of the analysis and correctness of
logic programs and their concurrent (constraint) extensions.  More
specifically, we are interested in proof methods based on abstract
interpretation and the applicability of methods developed in different
programming paradigms, like process algebras, Hoare logics, etc.  The
workshop also includes discussion of techniques for the development of
(concurrent) logic programs.

Workshop W3
Logic and Reasoning with Neural Networks

Organizers:
        Franz Kurfess, University of Ulm, Germany
	Alessandro Sperduti, University of Pisa, Italy

Contacts:
        Franz Kurfess
	Dept. of Neural Inf. Proc.,
	D-89069 Ulm, Germany.
	kurfess@neuro.informatik.uni-ulm.de

The goal of the workshop is to initiate discussions and foster interaction
between researchers interested in the use of neural networks and
connectionist models for various aspects of logic and reasoning. There are
a number of domains where thecombination of neural networks and logic
opens up interesting perspectives: methods for reasoning, know-ledge
representation, integration of symbolic and neural components,
implementation techniques.


Workshop W4
Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments

Organizers:
        Markus Fromherz, Xerox PARC Palo Alto, USA
	Anthony J. Kusalik, University of Saskatoon, Canada
	Oysten Nytro, University of Trondheim, Norway
	Steven Prestwich, ECRC Munich, Germany

Contacts:
        Anthony J. Kusalik
	Dept. of Comp. Sci.,
	Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
	S7N 0W0 Canada.
	kusalik@cs.usask.ca

This workshop will provide a forum for researchers and logic programming
system developers to exchange ideas and results on all aspects of
environments for logic programming.  This includes work related to design
issues, new techniques and tools, and the solution of noteworthy problems
arising, for example, from new logic programming languages or interesting
application areas.  Both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art
presentations are welcome.

Workshop W5
Non-monotonic Extension of Logic Programming:
Theory, Implementation and Applications

Organizers:
        Jurgen Dix, University of Koblenz, Germany
	Luis Moniz Pereira, Univ. Nova de Lisboa, Portugal
	Teodor Przymusinski, University of California
	Riverside, USA

Contacts:
        Jurgen Dix
	Dept. of Comp. Sci.,
	Rheinau 1, 56075 Koblenz, Germany.
	dix@informatik.uni-koblenz.de

Logic programs rely on a non-monotonic operator, often referred to as
negation by failure. The non-monotonicity of this operator allows us to
view logic programs as special non-monotonic theories and thus makes it
possible to draw from the extensive research in the area of non-monotonic
reasoning. This workshop focusses on non-monotonic extensions of logic
programming and will be concerned with all of the three aspects of Theory,
Implementation, and Applications.


Workshop W6
Parallel and Data-Parallel Execution of Declarative Languages

Organizers:
        Jonas Barklund, University of Uppsala, Sweden
	Bhat Jayaraman, SUNY Buffalo, USA
	Jiro Tanaka, University of Tsukuba, Japan

Contacts:
        Jonas Barklund
	Computing Science Dept., Box 311,
	S-751 05 Uppsala, Sweden.
	jonas@csd.uu.se

The workshop will focus on language constructs, implementation technology,
program analysis and practical experiences of declarative programming
languages on parallel computers. There will be an emphasis on data
parallel computation (not restricted to SIMD computation) and other
massively parallel computation models. It is expected that logic
programming languages will be more represented than, e.g., functional
programming languages, but we would consider participation from these
neighbouring fields valuable.

Workshop W7
Applications of Logic Programming to Software Engineering

Organizers:
 	P. Ciancarini,	 Universit` di Bologna, Italy
	L. Sterling, Case Western Reserve
	University, Cleveland, USA

Contacts:
        Paolo Ciancarini
	Dip. di Matematica,
	P. di Porta S. Donato, 5,  40127 Bologna, Italy.
	cianca@cs.unibo.it

We will discuss which features of logic programming are most useful for a
software engineer, and which software engineering applications have been
already developed based on a logic programming approach. Suggested topics
are: Requirement analysis, specification and design based on logic
programming, software engineering environments including rule-based
components, Prolog-based tools, software process modeling based on logic
languages, and Logic and Object-oriented programming methods.


Workshop W8
Integration of Declarative Paradigms

Organizers:
        Hassan Ait-Kaci, Simon Fraser University, Canada
	Michael Hanus, MPI Saarbr|cken, Germany

	jjmoreno@fi.upm.es

The interest on the integration of declarative paradigms and, in
particular, the integration of functional and logic programming, has been
spurred anew, especially for what concerns efficient implementation. The
aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different
communities as well as to give the logic programming community an idea of
recent advances in the area.  A non-exhaustive list of topics is: language
features, semantics, execution principles, implementation issues, abstract
interpretation of integrated languages, environments for integrated
languages.

Workshop W9
Second ICLP-Workshop on Deductive Databases -
Deductive Databases and Logic Programming

Organizers:
        Natraj Arni, InferData Corp. Vaustin, USA
	Ulrich Geske, GMD-FIRST Berlin, Germany
	Fosca Giannotti, CNUCE-CNR Pisa, Italy
	Els Laenens, Univ. Antwerp, Belgium

	seipel@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de

Deductive databases use logic programming as a powerful declarative
language for accessing and maintaining large amounts of data.  Recent
research results in logic programming are useful for extending the power
and efficiency of deductive database systems.  Topics of the workshop are:
disjunctive DBs; sets, types and aggregation; abstract interpretations and
program transformations; non-deterministic extensions of logic DB
languages; non-monotonic deduction; constraint reasoning in DBs;
subsumption; expressiveness of query languages; query optimization and
evaluation; logics of active DBs; updates and knowledge acquisition.


Workshop W10
Proof-Theoretical Extensions of Logic Programming
Organizers:
        Roy Dyckhoff, University of St. Andrew, Scotland
	Lars-Henrik Eriksson, SICS Stockholm, Sweden
	Alberto Momigliano, Carnegie Mellon University, USA

Contacts:
        Alberto Momigliano
	CMU, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890, U.S.A.
	mobile@lcl.cmu.edu

The workshop will provide a forum to discuss the use of proof-theoretical
techniques in logic programming as well as the influence of proof theory
on the future development of this field. Topics include proof-theoretical
foundations of logic programming, languages based on proof theory and
applications. Critical and comparative papers are also welcome.

Workshop W11
Logic programming and education

Organizers:
        Rosa Maria Bottino, IMA-CNR Genova, Italy
 	Paola Forcheri, IMA-CNR Genova, Italy

Contacts:
        Rosa Maria Bottino
	IMA, Via De Marini 6,
	16149 Genova, Italy.
	Bottino@IMAGE.GE.CNR.IT

The workshop will focus onto two different aspects of the research
concerned with the use of logic programming, in particular of Prolog, in
education.  >From one hand we consider issues and problems related to the
teaching (and learning) of Prolog: problems in understanding Prolog,
misconceptions of novices, ways of representing the behaviour of Prolog,
problems of supporting program construction and debugging, etc. On the
other hand we consider the opportunities offered by Prolog as a tool for
the implementation of classroom products, such as modelling tools,
tutoring systems, problem solvers etc.
