                           ======================

       1993 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES


Sponsored by:
     ACM SIGCHI - Special Interest Group on Computer & Human Interaction 
     ACM SIGART - Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence
In Cooperation with:
     AAAI - American Association for Artificial Intelligence
     British HCI Group


                             January 4-7, 1993
  Buena Vista Palace Hotel, Walt Disney World Village, Orlando, Florida



OBJECTIVES

Advances in multidisciplinary research are creating a new generation of 
intelligent interfaces that use computers to facilitate the interaction of 
people with information, knowledge, tasks and situations. These 
interfaces rely on advanced computational techniques and cognitive 
science theories to build systems that enhance user performance. Such 
systems can help users to accomplish complex tasks by interpreting 
ambiguous input, phrasing multimodal output in ways sensitive to users' 
abilities and situations, and providing effective advice and assistance. 

This new event stems from a prior successful workshop in 1988 on 
Architectures for Intelligent Interfaces (sponsored by AAAI/ACM SIGCHI). 
The 1993 International Workshop will focus on a diversity of approaches 
to human-computer interaction, from those employing advanced 
computational techniques to those incorporating cognitive and user 
models to amplify human cognitive abilities. 

GOAL

The goal of the workshop is to explore ways in which techniques for 
knowledge representation, inferencing, modeling, and presentation can 
provide the adaptability and reasoning capabilities required for more 
intelligent human-computer interaction. We aim to stimulate high quality 
discussion amongst participants from different countries and from 
disciplines such as cognitive science, human-computer interaction, 
computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. The workshop will 
bring together researchers and practitioners with an interest in methods, 
techniques, tools, and technology for constructing and evaluating 
intelligent systems. 

FORMAT

The intimate size, single track, and comfortable surroundings make this 
workshop an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and 
implementation experiences. Attendance will be limited to 100 
participants with presentations spread over three days. The format is 
split into two and a half days of presentations with one half day of 
working sessions, enhanced by three thought-provoking plenary speakers.

SCOPE

Interested participants should submit an original paper for review. 
Submissions addressing theory, system building, or evaluation issues are 
welcomed. Papers may address human-computer interaction or artificial 
intelligence/computational perspectives on (but not limited to) the 
following topics: 

--  Intelligent User Interfaces in a diverse range of application areas 
    including tutoring and advisory systems; natural language processing; 
    generation and understanding of nonverbal media; planning and 
    explanation; information retrieval; computer-supported cooperative 
    work, decision support and supervisory control.
--  Interface-Building Tools and Techniques: knowledge-based and user 
    modelling techniques for intelligent interface design, including plan 
    and intent recognition, automatic presentation, explanation, user 
    aiding (aids, critics, tutors), knowledge representation and modeling of 
    users, systems, tasks.
--  Intelligent front-ends to interactive, multimedia, hypermedia, and 
    knowledge-based systems.
--  Adaptive and customisable systems.
--  Intelligent Agents and agent-based interaction.
--  Requirements and architectures for intelligent, cooperative, and 
    multimodal interfaces.
--  Methods for analyzing, designing & evaluating users' needs & 
    performance, intelligent interfaces & systems.

SUBMISSIONS

Papers will be accepted either for presentation as talks or posters. 
Authors are encouraged to submit work-in-progress to the poster session 
whilst longer papers should highlight both the general scientific 
contribution of the research and its practical significance. Six camera-
ready copies of original papers written in English should be submitted, as 
long papers (presented as a talk: 8 pages) or as short papers (interactive 
poster presentation: 4 pages). Submitted papers must be unpublished, 
substantively different from papers currently under review and must not 
be submitted elsewhere before notification date. A book, including revised 
papers and workshop results, may be published following the meeting.

Each paper should have a separate cover page containing the title of the 
paper; author(s) and affiliation(s), contact address of main author, phone, 
fax and e-mail address; an abstract (100-200 words) and a list of up to 
five key words or phrases linked to the submission topics describing its 
content. Detailed formatting instructions are available (for an example, 
see the ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, July 1991, pp. 93-96).

DEADLINES

You are requested to send notification of intention to participate and 
potential titles of submissions before July 1, 1992, to 
iiWorkshop93.chi@xerox.com. lnterested participants should forward SIX 
camera-ready copies of their paper to Wayne Gray, Graduate School of 
Education, Room 1008, Fordham University, 113 West 60th Street, New 
York, NY 10023 U.S.A.; +1-212-636-6464. E-mail or fax submissions will 
not be considered. Papers must be received before July 17, 1992. Authors 
will be notified by September 25, 1992. For further information, contact 
the Conference Secretariat at iiWorkshop93.chi@xerox.com or at the 
mailing address below.

STUDENT SUPPORT

Limited financial support is available to support attendance of deserving
students at the 1993 Workshop in an attempt to help foster the field and
expose students to a broad base of current research.  The 1993 Workshop
acknowledges the support of AAAI in providing this funding.

Interested students should submit to the Workshop Secretariat a letter
describing their research interests and current projects along with an
endorsement from their advisor no later than August 25.
