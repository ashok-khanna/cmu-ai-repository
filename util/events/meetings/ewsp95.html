	    Third European Workshop on Planning (EWSP'95)
			   Assisi (Italy)
			September 27-29, 1995


The European Workshop on Planning is held alternatingly with the AIPS
conference. EWSP'95 will be following up on the two previous meetings,
in '91 in St Augustin (Germany) and in '93 in Vadstena (Sweden), which
provided focused forums of high quality for the exchange of ideas and
results to a selected audience of workers in the field.

The third EWSP will be held from September 27 to 29, 1995, in Assisi,
Italy, a beautiful medieval town close to Perugia.  Participation will
be by invitation only and the number of participants will be limited
to a maximum of approx. 75 persons.

Preprints will be available to participants. The workshop proceedings
will be published shortly after the workshop in book form, pursuing
the "Current Trends in AI Planning" series, by IOS Press, Amsterdam.
