             ALP'94                                     PLILP'94
 Fourth International Conference on         Sixth International Symposium on
       Algebraic and Logic                Programming Language Implementation
           Programming                            and Logic Programming


                               Madrid  (Spain)
                            September 14-16, 1994


Following the three previous  ALP conferences in Gaussig (1988), Nancy (1990),
and Volterra (1992),  as well  as the five previous PLILP meetings in  Orleans
(1988),  Linkoping (1990),  Passau (1991),  Leuven (1992) and  Tallinn (1993),
the Fourth International Conference on Algebraic and Logic Programming and the
Sixth International Symposium on Programming Language Implementation and Logic
Programming  will be held  concurrently in Madrid  (Spain).  The event will be
organized jointly by the  Computer  Science  Departments  of  the  Universidad
Complutense de Madrid (UCM) and the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM).


                                    TOPICS

ALP aims at strengthening  the  connections  between  algebraic techniques and
logic  programming.  PLILP aims  at stimulating  research  on new  declarative
concepts, methods, and techniques relevant for the implementation of all kinds
of  programming  languages  with  particular  emphasis  on logic  programming.
Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

  ALP:

        Semantics of algebraic and logic programming
        Integration of functional and logic programming
        Term rewriting, narrowing, resolution
        Constrained logic programming and constrained theorem proving
        Concurrent features in algebraic and logic programming languages
        Higher order features in algebraic and logic programming languages
        Implementation issues (with possible system demonstrations)


  PLILP:

        Declarative implementation techniques
        Implementation of declarative concepts
        Program analysis and transformation
        Compiler specification and construction
        Executable specifications
        Constraint programming
        Amalgamation of logic programming with algorithmic, functional
          or object-oriented programming
        Programming environments for declarative languages

The scientific program  will include a number of  invited talks in addition to
the presentations of the accepted papers.  Invited talks,  as well as possibly
a selection of accepted contributions, will be scheduled for plenary sessions.
Other accepted contributions  will be scheduled  for parallel  ALP  and  PLILP
sessions.  We anticipate two proceedings  volumes to be published  by Springer
Verlag in the LNCS series.  All the participants will receive both volumes.  A
limited  number  of  scholarships  may  be  available  for  subsidizing  those
participants who are unable to obtain support from other sources.
