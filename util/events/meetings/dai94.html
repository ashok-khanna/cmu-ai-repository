                          Call for Papers
    13th International Distributed Artificial Intelligence Workshop
                  July 28-30, 1994: Seattle WA USA
                        "Making Connections"

Goal
----

Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with the cooperative
solution of problems in multi-agent intelligent systems with both
computational and human agents.  The central problem in DAI is how to
achieve coordinated action among such agents, so that they can accomplish
more as a group than individually.

The DAI workshop is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in this
field. For over a decade now the workshop has gathered a relatively small
group of active researchers for intensive discussions on the state of the
art as well as fruitful directions for future exploration. Previous DAI
Workshops have resulted in nine summaries published in AI Magazine, two
volumes of edited papers published by Pitman/Morgan Kaufmann as well as
special issues of the journals "Group Decision and Negotiation" and "IEEE
Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics".

A wide range of research communities throughout the world are now
addressing issues related to DAI. This include work on CKBS (cooperating
knowledge-based systems), CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work), ICIS
(intelligent cooperating information systems), GDSS (group decision support
systems), CE (concurrent engineering), organizational sciences, social
psychology, business process management, anthropology and so on. There is
also increasing recognition of the need for collaboration support
technology in many settings, as evidenced for example by the large
international Intelligent Manufacturing System (IMS) Program which
envisages future manufacturing facilities based on globally distributed
autonomous and intelligent systems. Such potential application areas pose
great challenges for DAI.

The goal of the 1994 DAI workshop is therefore "making connections": trying
to better understand the connections between DAI and related fields as well
as real-world problems. It is hoped that the workshop deliberations will
help participants (1) develop a better understanding of the gaps between
current theory and potential applications and (2) identify future research
directions that integrate multi-disciplinary efforts to address these gaps.

Diverse perspectives and approaches are of interest including, but not
limited to:

   "real-world" DAI systems
        - case studies of implemented practical applications
        - principles for selecting and applying DAI ideas
   design of coordination-capable agents
        - task decomposition (speech act formalisms etc).
        - distributed reasoning and control
        - intelligent agents
        - conflict management/negotiation (game theory etc.)
        - agent models
   multi-agent learning
        - inductive
        - explanation-based
   societies of agents
        - design & behaviour
        - economic models
   implementational approaches
        - languages: object-based concurrent programming languages 
          such as Actors and reflective languages
        - frameworks: ABE, MACE, AGORA, blackboard systems, distributed 
          search and constraint satisfaction
        - infrastructures
        - integration of heterogeneous systems

Workshop Time & Location
------------------------

July 28, 1994:        all day technical sessions
July 29, 1994:        morning sessions, open afternoon, evening reception
July 30, 1994:        morning session only - adjourn at noon

Site: rustic retreat (location TBD soon) close to Seattle to allow
participants to continue to AAAI conference in downtown Seattle July 31.

Structure
---------

The workshop will consist of several basic elements:

o Technical Presentations: There will be several moderated technical
sessions, each focusing on a particular technical theme, consisting of 3-4
10-15 minute talks follow by 30-40 minute Q&A sessions where the moderator
addresses initial questions to all the speakers and facilitates audience
participation.

o Invited Talks: We plan to include several invited presentations by
potential "customers" of DAI technology (e.g. from concurrent engineering,
sales & labor negotiations, scheduling, shop floor control,
telecommunications, networks, budget processes etc.) as well as potential
"collaborators" (i.e. prominent researchers in related fields such as CSCW
and GDSS).

o "Breakout" Groups: The workshop will include the opportunity for workshop
participants to divide into smaller groups for intensive discussions on
gaps between current theory and practical requirements, as well as new
inter-disciplinary research directions to addresss these gaps. Each group
will communicate their results to the workshop as a whole in a closing
technical session.

o Poster/Demo Session: Participants will be invited to display posters and
other demos describing  their work during the open afternoon July 29.

Participation Requirements
--------------------------

Participation at the Workshop will be by invitation only and limited to
approximately 35 people.  To participate, please submit 4 copies of a
technical paper (15 pages or less) describing original research or
significant applications in DAI.

Preference will be given to work that addresses one or more of the DAI
themes listed above, and that presents clear statements of research
findings rather than discussion of topics of study. We specifically
discourage the submission of papers in areas such as fine-grained
parallelism, hardware or language-level concurrency, and connectionism,
because we feel that work in these areas is more appropriate for other
workshops.  We welcome both theoretical and applied papers. Theoretical
papers should explain how their principles and methods can be mapped to
applications, while applied papers should explain why they use the
techniques that they do and why other approaches are less appropriate for
the problem at hand.

A small number of "interested observers" may also be invited to attend. 
Please submit a brief (1-2 page) description of your research interests and
reason for participation.

Please send submissions to the workshop chair and include electronic mail
addresses for the authors. Electronic submissions in ascii, Macintosh Word
or RTF format are welcome.
        
        Papers due      March 15, 1994
        Notification    April 30, 1994
        Final papers    May 30, 1994

Participants are invited to prepare posters and/or demos for presentation
during the open period the afternoon of July 29. Please let the workshop
chair know if you plan to do so.

A limited number of "scholarships" will be available to support attendance
of the workshop by graduate students of limited means. Please indicate if
you would like to be considered for this on your submission.
