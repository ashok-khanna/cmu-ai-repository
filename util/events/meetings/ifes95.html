                        FUZZ-IEEE/IFES '95
                 CALL FOR FUZZY ROBOT COMPETITION

                         March  20-24, 1995
                          YOKOHAMA, Japan

Venue:Yokohama Prince Hotel
Sponsor:FUZZ-IEEE/IFES '95 Fuzzy Robot Competition Organizing Committee
Competition Organizing Committee Chair: 
        Hisao Shiizuka (Kogakuin Univ.)
Competition Organizing Commitee:
        Takanori Shibata (Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, MITI)
        Koji Takeda (Fuji Xerox)
        Jun Tani (Sony CSL)
        Toru Yamaguchi (Utsunomiya Univ.)

   "FUZZ-IEEE/IFES '95" is the joint international conference of the Second
International Fuzzy Engineering Symposium and the Fourth IEEE International
Conference on Fuzzy Systems.  At this conference, a "Fuzzy Robot Competition" 
is planned in which participants compete using fuzzy technology and fuzzy 
information processing.  Participants will not present the actual robot,
rather they will compete by recording on video the robot they have 
constructed. This is a call for participants to take up this challenge.

How to Apply for Competition

Evaluations of Competition:
  The evaluations are based on two categories:"Motion" and "Intelligence"

Requirments of Competition:
(1) The contents of the video tape must be previously undisclosed
(2) Relevant technologies are fuzzy or neural networks, chaos, and genetic
algorithms, for such applications as flying robots, game robots,
sumo-wrestling robots, empty -can-collecting robots, and apple-peeling
robots.  They can be mobile or fixed so long as they move autonomously
through computer control. 
(3) Competition participants set and indicate their own conditions, and
record the performance on video tape.  At the same time, a paper must be
written describing the hardware and the system architecture.  However, an
explanation of theory must not be included in the video tape, but written
in the paper.

What to Submit:
    Two video tapes (the master tape and one copy, 3-5 minutes, VHS) recording
the performance of the fuzzy robot  However, they must be of good recording
quality.
    A paper written in English detailing the robot, of approximately 4 pages(A4 or letter-paper size)

Publication of a Video Proceedings:
    Selected robots that have been accepted will be compiled into a video
proceedings.

Publication of Competition Papers:
    The papers which have been accepted will be published.

Award:
    There will be a strict examination of the works that have been accepted,
and certificates awarded to excellent robots.  Supplementary prizes will be
awarded as well (one million yen in total.)

Transfer of Copyright:
   The copyright of the papers and video tapes accepted in this competition
will be transferred to the IEEE FUZZ/IFES '95.

Deadline of Submission:   End of November 1994

Notice of Acceptance:     End of January 1995

Papers and Videos should be submitted to:
LIFE (Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research)
Siber Hegner Bilding 4FL. 89-1 Yamashita-cho, Naka-ku, Yokohama 231, Japan
