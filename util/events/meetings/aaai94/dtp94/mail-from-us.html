Subject: Administrative stuff for spring symposium

I just got a bunch of messages from Hendler 
about boring administrative matters.

The least boring item is that we have to submit the 
call for participation to him by next Wednesday. 
I just looked over the the proposal and I don't 
think we have to change it much except for 
  -- we need to be specific about what we want in the 
     way of submissions
  -- if we want to add a fourth organizer we have 
     to do that now too.  
  -- we need to decide on 
     who we should send the CFP to---AAAI will send it to 
     the membership and to some obvious places like comp.ai, 
     but if we want the "outside world" to know about it we'll 
     have to send it other places too.   The uncertainty mailing
     list that Agosta maintains is an obvious choice, and I'll 
     contact some of my old Wharton DecSci friends too.  We 
     should be fairly organized and diligent about getting 
     the word out, though.

I'm inclined to solicit either full papers, extended 
abstracts, or short statements of interest, the first
two if the authors want to be considered for presenting 
material at the symposium itself.   The nature of the 
material we solicit at first does *not* determine what 
goes into the working notes.   

A quick summary of the timetable is:

         July 28    Draft of CFP to AAAI
         mid Aug    CFP to AAAI membership
         Oct 15     Submissions to us
         Nov 15     We decide on participants
         Jan 31     Working notes material to us
         Feb 11     Working notes from us to AAAI

Here's some more organizational trivia I've done:
   -- I've made publically available a directory with all 
      the stuff I've gotten from AAAI and the proposal 
      we sent in.  We can use that as a repository for 
      future material.  To get at the directory:
          1. ftp to cs.washington.edu
          2. cd pub/ai/dtp-symposium
          3. the only file you'll probably find interesting 
             at this point is mail-from-aaai, which contains 
             the stuff I just got from Hendler.  Among the 
             messages in that file are the timetable, a list 
             of the other symposia, the timetable, and some specific 
             instructions about what we need to do eventually.
             Nothing urgent at this point except for the 
             CFP.
   -- I'll create a mail alias 
              dtp-symposium@cs.washington.edu
      that we can first use for the submissions and later can 
      use to contact the invitees.  You'll have to decide 
      at some point whether you want to be on the mailing list 
      (and thus receive the submissions directly) or whether 
      you'd rather have me compile them here and distribute 
      them.

Guess that's it for now.  What I need from you in the short 
term is (1) any suggestions/preferences about what to solicit
from applicants, and (2) any suggestions for a fourth 
committee member, if any.

Over & out,
Steve.

Would it be possible to set up a mail alias
      dtp-symposium
to handle mail traffic for an upcoming Stanford
Spring Symposium I'm organizing?   I'll put 
the mailing list in   june:~hanks/dtp-symposium/dtp-symposium.mlist
if that's OK.  

Thanks,
Steve.

Not much time.  I believe that Stuart is in England and incommunicado until
1 August, so the two of us will have to handle this.

It is probably still worth going over and rewriting.  I will try to take a
stab later today.

Stuart seemed to be keen on this, but obviously won't be able to follow up.
 I am inclined to let it go.

Sure, we can send it to lots of places on the net.  There was talk at UAI
of setting up a new forum, since Agosta's has kind of stagnated.

Sounds right to me.  Let us also state that both position papers (e.g.,
assessments of state-of-the-art) and technical contributions are welcome. 
What I would like to avoid is too many people presenting the same work they
are going to present at AAAI, AIPS, or UAI in the summer.

  The nature of the

Yes, but nobody is going to prepare new stuff for the working notes after
acceptance.  

>          2. cd pub/ai/dtp-symposium

For some reason, I could not cd to dtp-symposium ("No such file or
directory", though it looked like it was there).

Sure.

I made only some very minor changes---got rid of 
"the call for participation will..." and added 
information about how to submit at the bottom.
I agreee, I think it came out pretty well.
Text below also appears in the ftp directory under

1994 Spring Symposium Call for Participation
=================

Title: Decision-Theoretic Planning

=================

Organizing Committee:

Steve Hanks, University of Washington (chair)
   hanks@cs.washington.edu
Stuart Russell, University of California, Berkeley
   russell@cs.berkeley.edu
Michael P. Wellman, University of Michigan 
   wellman@engin.umich.edu
   
=====================

Both AI planning and decision theory are devoted to the problem of how an 
agent chooses a good course of action, based on information about the 
world and about the agent's capabilities and preferences.

The AI community has concentrated on the task of synthesis: given a 
description of a situation, schematic descriptions of actions with methods 
for composing them, and some objectives, generate a course of action that 
furthers those objectives.  Classical planning algorithms have for the most 
part assumed that the agent has perfect information about and control over 
the world, and that the objectives are described by a symbolic goal state 
that either is or is not satisfied. 

These simplifying assumptions conspire to make it difficult to reason 
about tradeoffs in the planning process, in particular tradeoffs involving 
the relative likelihood and desirability of possible plan outcomes. Under 
the classical assumptions, both plan success and plan quality are 
all-or-nothing propositions.

Decision theory provides a language for expressing richer notions of 
success and quality, along with a normative criterion for making tradeoffs 
among plans achieving the objectives with varying degrees and likelihoods.  
Decision theory lacks a computational model of how to generate those plans 
in the first place, however, and thus does not address the synthesis task.

This symposium aims to unify current lines of research in the AI planning 
community with research in related disciplines---decision analysis, 
economics, and control theory---by exploring how the richer constructs offered 
by the decision-theoretic methodology for describing preference and 
uncertainty can be applied to the problem of plan synthesis.  Although AI 
and decision theory have sometimes been viewed as competing approaches, a 
growing number of researchers have begun to appreciate their complementary 
character, and are starting to address the challenge of integrating these 
ideas.

We invite contributions pertaining to all aspects of decision-theoretic 
planning, particularly those making substantive connections between the 
two fields. Topics will include, but are not limited to:

-- Representing and reasoning about preferences 
How can AI planning's notion of goals be extended to richer utility models? 
How do we represent concepts such as partial goal satisfaction, the cost 
of consuming resources, multiple objectives, and so on?

-- Uncertain effects of actions
How can causal or action models be extended to take into account 
uncertainty about the state of the world, the effects of actions, and 
exogenous events?  How do we represent information-gathering actions 
(e.g. active sensing), and cope with the complexity of conditional 
planning? 

-- Model construction
How can representations and techniques from the decision sciences and 
other disciplines---e.g., graphical decision models such as influence 
diagrams and solution techniques such as policy iteration---be applied to 
the problem of plan generation?  In particular, how can we exploit these 
technologies without unduly restricting the expressiveness of our 
representation for actions and their effects?

-- Specialized problems and representations 
For example, what is the relationship between decision-theoretic techniques
for path- and motion-planning problems that generally describe their state
spaces and operators numerically and the problems involving symbolic state
spaces and operators more typically addressed by AI planning research?

-- Decision-theoretic meta-level reasoning 
How can decision-theoretic criteria be applied to the problem of 
controlling the reasoning of an agent so that it behaves rationally 
without (necessarily) using decision-theoretic calculations to make its 
decisions?  Possible techniques include the use of decision theory to 
control the plan-generation process itself, and using the methodology to 
pre-compile rational behaviors. 

Various groups in AI, in the decision sciences, in control theory, and in 
economics have been pursuing research efforts using the concepts and 
techniques underlying decision-theoretic planning.  The efforts have varied 
in the issues they consider important and in the simplifying assumptions 
they make.  This symposium will provide a forum for exploring these
differences, with the aim of distinguishing the fundamental barriers 
from those merely cultural or terminological.  By cross-fertilizing 
the ideas from several decision disciplines (of which AI planning is one), 
we will ultimately arrive at a better understanding of the common enterprise. 

=====================
Submission information

We invite submissions of two sorts:

  -- Technical contributions,  for which an extended abstract
     of at most five pages should be submitted.  Work in progress
     is encouraged.    

  -- Position papers or statements of interest.  These should be 
     short (1 to 2 page) statements indicating the submittor's particular 
     interest in the symposium's topic, specifically addressing
     how his or her research or experience attacks the problem 
     of reconciling the decision-theoretic and AI planning
     approaches to problem solving (or would benefit from such 
     a reconciliation).

We strongly encourage electronic submissions.  Send submissions 
and questions to 

         dtp-symposium@cs.washington.edu

Send paper submissions to
