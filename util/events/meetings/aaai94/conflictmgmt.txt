Workshop Description
--------------------

A central aspect of cooperative problem solving is the avoidance,
detection, and resolution of conflicts among group members.  Therefore,
conflict management is of great theoretical and practical interest in
the development of models of multiagent problem solving.  Work on
conflict management has occurred in a variety of settings including
Multiagent Planning and Design, Artificial Intelligence and Law,
Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Group Decision Support Systems,
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Software Engineering, Sociology,
Organizational Science, and International Relations.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together academic and industrial
researchers from diverse fields to exchange ideas and promote discussion
about models of conflict management.  Through exploring common themes,
it is hoped the participants will better understand related work from
other areas, and can begin to outline a general theory of conflict
management across multiple domains.  The workshop also aims to encourage
progress toward better models of conflict management and better tools
for supporting it.

Topics
------

Papers are encouraged in, but not limited to, the following topics:

  o What are the current theoretical underpinnings for conflict
    management, and how can they be applied to practical problems?

  o How and where are theoretical and computational models of conflict
    management being used today?  How do these models fare in real-world
    environments?

  o What lessons do empirical studies of conflict management have to
    offer for the development of the next generation of computational
    models?

  o How can computers support group conflict management? What are the
    benefits and challenges of the different approaches?

  o Which aspects of conflict management are generic and which are
    domain-specific? Can the same techniques work with human and
    computational participants?


Format
------

This full-day workshop will consist of four moderated sessions, each
focusing on a primary subject area and including:

  o a moderator's overview of common themes and key issues

  o presentations of selected papers by workshop participants:
    presenters will be asked to address key issues identified by the
    moderators

  o a discussion panel, focusing on shared issues rather than on further
    explanation of participants' individual work.

Workshop participants will also be invited to display posters describing
their work.

Attendance:
-----------

Participation is by invitation only, and will be limited to
approximately 35 people.

Submission Requirements:
-----------------------

Those who wish to attend the workshop should submit either: 1) four
copies of a brief research summary and statement of interest; or 2)
those who wish to present current research at the workshop
should submit four copies of a research abstract (no longer than 6
pages), focusing on the main contribution of the work in preference to
introductory material, literature review, etc.  Please include a
list of keywords (e.g, design, planning, CSCW, etc.), the authors'
electronic and physical address information, and indicate if you would
like to display a poster at the workshop.  Either hard-copy or email
submissions are welcome.
