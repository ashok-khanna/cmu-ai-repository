       KDD-94: AAAI Workshop on Knowledge Discovery in Databases 
               Seattle, Washington, July 31-August 1, 1994
               ===========================================

Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is an area of common interest for
researchers in machine learning, machine discovery, statistics, intelligent
databases, knowledge acquisition, data visualization and expert systems. The
rapid growth of data and information created a need and an opportunity for
extracting knowledge from databases, and both researchers and application
developers have been responding to that need.  KDD applications have been
developed for astronomy, biology, finance, insurance, marketing, medicine,
and many other fields.  Core Problems in KDD include representation issues,
search complexity, the use of prior knowledge, and statistical inference.

This workshop will continue in the tradition of the 1989, 1991, and 1993 KDD
workshops by bringing together researchers and application developers from
different areas, and focusing on unifying themes such as the use of domain
knowledge, managing uncertainty, interactive (human-oriented) presentation,
and applications.  The topics of interest include:

        Applications of KDD Techniques
        Interactive Data Exploration and Discovery
        Foundational Issues and Core Problems in KDD
        Machine Learning/Discovery in Large Databases
        Data and Knowledge Visualization
        Data and Dimensionality Reduction in Large Databases
        Use of Domain Knowledge and Re-use of Discovered Knowledge
        Functional Dependency and Dependency Networks 
        Discovery of Statistical and Probabilistic models
        Integrated Discovery Systems and Theories
        Managing Uncertainty in Data and Knowledge
        Machine Discovery and Security and Privacy Issues

We also invite working demonstrations of discovery systems. The workshop
program will include invited talks, a demo and poster session, and panel
discussions. To encourage active discussion, workshop participation will be
limited.  The workshop proceedings will be published by AAAI.  As in previous
KDD Workshops, a selected set of papers from this workshop will be considered
for publication in journal special issues and as chapters in a book.

Please submit 5 *hardcopies* of a short paper (a maximum of 12 single-spaced
pages, 1 inch margins, and 12pt font, cover page must show author(s) full
address and E-MAIL and include 200 word abstract + 5 keywords) to reach the 
workshop chairman on or before March 1, 1994.
