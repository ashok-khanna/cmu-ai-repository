Jim,
 Good idea. Here's what we'll do. Please forward it to all interested parties.
Thanks, and stay warm.

Due to the earthquake in Los Angeles, and the severe winter weather in the
North-Eastern U.S. and Canada, the deadline for the receipt of AAAI papers is
being extended to Friday, January 28, 1994, for those authors that are severely
impacted by these events. In order to minimize disruption of the self-selection
and review process, however, the title pages, including paper title, authors,
addresses, content areas, and abstract, must still arrive at the AAAI office by
Monday, January 24th. These should be sent electronically, to
abstract@aaai.org, in the format specified in the call for papers. This
extension applies only to those individuals whose ability to complete their
papers on time was severely impacted by these events, and authors are requested
and expected to be honest in their use of it. If an electronic title page is
submitted, but a decision is later made not to submit the paper, please send a
message to abstract@aaai.org informing us of this fact as soon as possible.
Please forward this message to anyone you know who may have been impacted by
the storms or earthquake. Thank you very much.
