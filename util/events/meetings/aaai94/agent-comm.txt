               Planning for Inter-agent Communication
===========================================================================

Description of Workshop:

Planning for inter-agent communication, whether in some natural or
artificial language, requires real-time planning of resource-bounded
communicative acts that change other agents' knowledge (and
consequently, perhaps their actions).  Communication planning is a
promising domain for "scale-up" of planning techniques because a planner
must handle larger numbers of interacting constraints than are normally
attempted, apply these constraints to a larger number of choices in the
development and realization of a plan, and deal with inherent
uncertainties about the effects of a communicative action on a
recipient.  Communication planning has received some attention in (at
least) the discourse planning, theories of action, robotics, and
distributed AI communities.  The purpose of this workshop is to bring
together representatives of these communities, with the specific
objectives of:
 1. identifying characteristic functional requirements of the
    communication planning problem, supported with examples,
 2. identifying planning formalisms or models of natural language
    discourse that can provide these required functionalities, or
    identifying functionalities that have not been modeled, and
 3. proposing future research that would facilitate progress in at least
    two of the relevant research communities.
 The workshop will be organized towards the goal of consensus on a
union of these observations, i.e., a list of functional requirements
paired with either identified planning formalisms or discourse models
or proposals for further research.

Topics:

 Potential topics include how planning formalisms or discourse models
can (when appropriate):
 * generate communicative goals and select those worth pursuing,
 * respect limitations of the recipient's working memory,
 * rely on the recipient's inferences to achieve communicative goals,
 * prevent unintentional effects not limited to the negation of explicit
   goals,
 * deliberately overload communicative acts to achieve multiple goals,
 * address a single communicative goal in multiple ways to increase
   the likelyhood of success,
 * deliberately violate normally-respected "conversational rules" to
   achieve a communicative effect,
 * plan to communicate the goal-structure of the communication itself,
 * plan to evaluate the success of communicative acts,
 * be sensitive to prior plans and communications, and to their
   failures, and
 * initiate concurrent execution after a temporal resource bound.

Format of Workshop: 

The workshop will take place over a day and a half. The first day will
be divided equally between selected presentations grouped by the issues
they address and discussion of those issues. A working committee will
synthesize the day's discussion in the evening, and the second morning
will be devoted to presentation and discussion of a summary of
conclusions and issues for further research.

Attendance: 

The workshop will be limited to 40 participants, with invitations based
on submitted position papers.

Submission requirements: 

Potential participants should submit a short (2000 words or less)
position paper, preferably via email in plain text, or in postscript if
figures are required.  If electronic submission is not possible, submit
4 printed copies.  Invited authors will have the option of including
revised versions of their papers in a citable AAAI Press Technical
Report to be based on the workshop.
