                                CALL FOR PAPERS

                               for the symposium

             ======================================================
                Artificial Neural Networks and Adaptive Systems
             ======================================================

          chairs: Stephen Grossberg, USA, and Georg Dorffner, Austria

                                 as part of the
          Twelfth European Meeting on Cybernetics and Systems Research

                                April 5-8, 1994
                             University of Vienna,
                                Vienna, Austria


        For this symposium,  papers  on  any  theoretical  or  practical
        aspect of artificial neural networks are invited. Special focus,
        however, will  be  put  on  the  issue  of  adaptivity  both  in
        practical engineering applications and in applications of neural
        networks to the modeling of human behavior.   By  adaptivity  we
        mean  the  capability  of  a  neural network to adjust itself to
        changing environments.  For this, a careful distinction  between
        "learning" to devise weight matrices for a neural network before
        it is applied (and usually left  unchanged)  on  one  hand,  and
        "true"  adaptivity  of  a  given  neural  network  to constantly
        changing conditions on the other hand - i.e. real-time  learning
        in unstationary environments - is made.  The following is a - by
        no means exhaustive - list of possible topics in this realm:

          - online learning of neural network applications facing
            changing data distributions
          - transfer of neural network solutions to
            related but different domains
          - application of neural networks for
            adaptive autonomous systems
          - "phylogenetic" vs. "ontogenetic" adaptivity
            (e.g. adaptivity of connectivity and architecture vs.
             adaptivity of coupling parameters or weights)
          - short term vs. long term adaptation
          - adaptive reinforcement learning
          - adaptive pattern recognition
          - localized vs. distributed approximation (in terms of
            overlap of decision regions) and adaptivity

        Preference will be given  to  contributions  that  address  such
        issues  of  adaptivity,  but  -  as  mentioned initially - other
        original work on neural newtorks is also welcome.

        As an additional  highlight, Prof. S. Grossberg  will be one  of 
        the plenary speakers of the EMCSR 1994.

        Below is  a  description  of  the  EMCSR  conference  containing
        guidelines  for  submissions.  Note  that  for  this  particular
        symposium the deadline has been extended to

                      ====================================
                                 October 20, 1993
                      ====================================

        If you are planning to submit by this postponed deadline, please
        send  a  brief notification containing a tentative title of your
        submission to

                             georg@ai.univie.ac.at

        by Oct 8 (the original deadline). Electronic  submission  (latex
        or  postscript) to the same address is possible (note again that
        this applies only for this symposium, and  does  not  apply  for
        camera ready accepted FINAL papers).

                          !Hope to see you in Vienna!

About the Congress:
- -------------------
The international support of the European Meetings on Cybernetics and
Systems Research held in Austria in 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982,
1984, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992 (when 300 scientists from more than 30
countries met to present, hear and discuss 210 papers) encouraged the
Council of the Austrian Society for Cybernetic Studies (OSGK) to organize a
similar meeting in 1994 to keep pace with continued rapid developments in
related fields.

A number of Symposia will be arranged and we are grateful to colleagues who
have undertaken the task of preparing these events. As on the earlier
occasions, eminent speakers of international reputation will present latest
research results at daily plenary sessions.

Systems Research, edited by R. Trappl, have been published by World
Scientific, Singapore as :
