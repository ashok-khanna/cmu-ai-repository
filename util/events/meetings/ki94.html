18th German Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence

	Saarbr"ucken, September, 18-23, 1994

General Chairs: J"org Siekmann, DFKI, Univ. Saarbr"ucken		
		Hans-J"urgen B"urckert, DFKI Saarbr"ucken

The scientific, as well as the economic importance of 
Artificial Intelligence research has steadily 
grown, even though in some degree, partly slower than 
had been hoped for. AI research in Germany had a 
belated start, but steadily improved in recent years. Today 
the field is well established and some areas even play an 
outstanding role internationally. This positive 
development is accounted for in the forthcoming German 
Conference on AI, which is especially broadly based, 
aiming at researchers, university students, users and 
practitioners in industry alike.

The German Conference on Artificial Intelligence is 
traditionally organised once a year by the AI-section of the 
German Society for Computer Science (GI). This is one of has
the four subdivisions of the GI and today the AI section 
more than four thousand members. In 1994, the conference will 
be carried out at the University fo Saarland in Saarbr"ucken 
by the German Research Center of AI (DFKI), the Computer 
Science Department (FBI), the Institute of Computer 
Linguistics (CoLi) and the Max Planck Institute for 
Computer Science (MPI). It comprises a Scientific 
Conference, from the 18th to 22nd of September 1994, 
and an Industrial Congress on the 22nd and 23rd of 
September 1994. Tutorials will be offered on Sunday the 
18th, scientific talks form Tuesday to Thursday in the 
morning and workshops in the afternoon.

On Monday a symposium will be held, covering a selected 
topic, the "International Symposium on Logics in Artificial 
Intelligence", chaired by Dov Gabbay (Imperial College 
London) and J"org Siekmann (DFKI, University of Saarland). 
Invited speakers will give lectures on current issues 
pertaining to this context. This is prompted by the 
publication of the multivolume "Handbook of Logics in 
Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming".

The Industrial Congress offers a multifaceted programme 
which demonstrates how AI is put into industrial practice: 
talks on areas of applications of AI, consulting service 
offers from the German AI-Institutes' association (AKI) and 
an AI Exhibition.

Contributions to the Scientific Conference and the 
Industrial Congress will be published in a set of Springer-
Verlag conference publications. KI-94 will be supported 
by an advisory board consisting of the previous and future 
chair persons, as well as representatives from Industry 
and University.

Posters and System Demos at the Scientific Conference
=====================================================
Research groups and scientists will be given the 
opportunity through posters and system demos to 
present current AI-projects and AI-systems. These 
contributions will be reviewed by the program committee 
as well, and will appear along with the papers in the LNAI.

Submission Deadline for the Scientific Conference
=================================================
Papers and proposals for posters should be sent in six (6) 
copies to one of the two program chairs (s.f.) till April 
8th, 1994. Papers received after that date cannot be 
considered. Fax or e-mail submissions are also 
unacceptable.

The papers should be clearly legible and written in 12 
point type. The length of a paper should not exceed 16 
pages with roughly 38 lines/page and 75 characters per 
line (corresponding to a standard LaTex article-style), 
including bibliography and appendix. The title page is 
separate.

Proposals for posters and system demos require the 
submision of a one- to three-page summary of the 
presentation (adding diagramms if necessary).

The title page should show the title of the contribution, 
the catagory (paper, poster or system demo), the names 
of all authors with postal and e-mail addresses. In additon, 
the title page should contain an abstract, of not more than 
200 words, supplemented optionally by keywords which 
characterise the contribution's content.

In order to facilitate the review process, the contents of 
the title page should be sent till April 8th via e-mail to

	ki-94-abstract@dfki.uni-sb.de

using only plain ASCII text. The order of content in this 
message should be

TITLE:<title> 
AUTHOR:<name of first author> 
ADDRESS:<address of first author> 
AUTHOR:<second author> 
..... 
AREA:<area> 
KEYWORDS:<keywords> 
ABSTRACT:<summary>

Review Process
==============
All submitted papers, proposals for posters and system 
demos will be reviewed by at least two members of the 
program committee.

The main criteria underlying the judgment of papers are 
the achieved results, originality, technical quality and 
presentation. Proposals for posters and system demos 
are judged against their AI-context and quality of 
presentation. The authors will be informed of the program 
committee's decision by May 20th.

Publication
===========
Accepted papers will be allocated 12 pages in the 
conference proceedings, which will be published in the 
Springer LNAI series. Each accepted poster and system 
demo will have one page reserved in the conference 
proceedings for a summary of its presentation. A camera-
ready copy must be submitted to one of the program 
chairs by June 17th, 1994.

	=========================
	===  KI-94 Workshops  ===
	=========================

Chairs: J"urgen Kunze, HU Berlin		
	Herbert Stoyan, Universit"at Erlangen

The Workshops take place in the afternoon on 
September 20th and 22th. A workshop should discuss 
current problems in applications of AI and basic research. 
Its participants will be working on these problems and will 
share a common interest in an interchange with equally 
inclined persons or those active in similar areas. However, 
this should not entail lengthy papers. Problems should 
be well focused; extensive topics are not suitable. All 
users, researchers and producers in the field of AI who 
are interested in an intensive discussion should submit 
an appropriate proposal.

Submission of Workshop Proposals
================================
A group of 25 active participants is envisaged. The 
Workshops should be made, if possible, accessible to 
other conference attendees. The workshop organisers 
will decide for themselves the conditions for attendance 
and possible papers, which are required. Ample time 
should be set out for general discussion. The total 
duration of such a workshop will cover two to three 
afternoons (4 hour tracks each). The "Extended 
Abstracts" of the workshop contributions will be 
published in a second volume, the general workshop 
proceedings.

Proposals for Workshops, of about two pages in length, 
should contain:

 -  Workshop topic. This can be subdivided concisely into 
    specific problems.
 -  Name of the workshop.
 -  A brief explanation why the workshop is of particular 
    interest at this time.
 -  The names and addresses of the organising committee. 
    The three to four members should be knowledgeable 
    in their fields, preferably bringing in a differing of 
    perspectives to the workshop topic. This should be 
    reflected in the proposal.
 -  An indication of likely schedule and time involved and if 
    possible a list of likely attendees.

Workshop proposals will gain merit, which tackle 
controversial issues, which speed scientific advances and 
support the formation and testing of theoretical results 
and their transfer into practical applications.

The workshop proposals must be submitted as soon as 
possible, at the latest by December 3rd,1993. Organisers 
will produce a call for workshop participation and submit 
this by January 14th, 1993. This call will be released in the 
first edition of the 1994 German AI-journal. Further 
distribution of this call lies in the organisers' hands.

Workshop Participants
=====================
Organisers decide workshop attendance on the basis of 
submissions and required contributions, which they must 
receive by May 1st, 1994. Attendees must be notified by 
May 15th, 1994. A one to two page document containing 
an attendance list, the programme and a brief description 
of the workshop must be sent till May 1st, 1994 to one of 
the workshop coordinators (s.f.). The contents will be 
published in a special edition of the German AI-journal.

Publication of Workshop Contributions
=====================================
Abstracts of all Workshop contributions will appear in a 
seperate workshop volume which, along with the other 
conference proceeding's volumes, will be handed out to 
each participant. The abstracts will amount to two pages in 
length (including title, authors and bibliography) using 12 
point type, and each page having roughly 38 lines with 75 
characters per line. The revised copies of the workshop 
papers must be collected by the respective organisers till 
June 1st, 1994, be supplemented by an opening 
summary (similar in length to the workshop papers) and 
forwarded to Herbert Stoyan (s.f.) by June 17th, 1994.

Workshop Scheduling
===================
All workshop participants must register for the KI-94. The 
local arrangement committee will provide venues, govern 
the organisation and coordinate the workshop curriculum. 
The workshop coordinators reserve the right to drop 
workshops that fail to organise within the set bounds. 
Workshops shall not be used as a forum for marketing 
hard- and software products.

	===  KI-94 Workshops  ===
	=========================

Chairs: J"urgen Kunze, HU Berlin		
	Herbert Stoyan, Universit"at Erlangen

The Workshops take place in the afternoon on 
September 20th and 22th. A workshop should discuss 
current problems in applications of AI and basic research. 
Its participants will be working on these problems and will 
share a common interest in an interchange with equally 
inclined persons or those active in similar areas. However, 
this should not entail lengthy papers. Problems should 
be well focused; extensive topics are not suitable. All 
users, researchers and producers in the field of AI who 
are interested in an intensive discussion should submit 
an appropriate proposal.

Submission of Workshop Proposals
================================
A group of 25 active participants is envisaged. The 
Workshops should be made, if possible, accessible to 
other conference attendees. The workshop organisers 
will decide for themselves the conditions for attendance 
and possible papers, which are required. Ample time 
should be set out for general discussion. The total 
duration of such a workshop will cover two to three 
afternoons (4 hour tracks each). The "Extended 
Abstracts" of the workshop contributions will be 
published in a second volume, the general workshop 
proceedings.

Proposals for Workshops, of about two pages in length, 
should contain:

 -  Workshop topic. This can be subdivided concisely into 
    specific problems.
 -  Name of the workshop.
 -  A brief explanation why the workshop is of particular 
    interest at this time.
 -  The names and addresses of the organising committee. 
    The three to four members should be knowledgeable 
    in their fields, preferably bringing in a differing of 
    perspectives to the workshop topic. This should be 
    reflected in the proposal.
 -  An indication of likely schedule and time involved and if 
    possible a list of likely attendees.

Workshop proposals will gain merit, which tackle 
controversial issues, which speed scientific advances and 
support the formation and testing of theoretical results 
and their transfer into practical applications.

The workshop proposals must be submitted as soon as 
possible, at the latest by December 3rd,1993. Organisers 
will produce a call for workshop participation and submit 
this by January 14th, 1993. This call will be released in the 
first edition of the 1994 German AI-journal. Further 
distribution of this call lies in the organisers' hands.

Workshop Participants
=====================
Organisers decide workshop attendance on the basis of 
submissions and required contributions, which they must 
receive by May 1st, 1994. Attendees must be notified by 
May 15th, 1994. A one to two page document containing 
an attendance list, the programme and a brief description 
of the workshop must be sent till May 1st, 1994 to one of 
the workshop coordinators (s.f.). The contents will be 
published in a special edition of the German AI-journal.

Publication of Workshop Contributions
=====================================
Abstracts of all Workshop contributions will appear in a 
seperate workshop volume which, along with the other 
conference proceeding's volumes, will be handed out to 
each participant. The abstracts will amount to two pages in 
length (including title, authors and bibliography) using 12 
point type, and each page having roughly 38 lines with 75 
characters per line. The revised copies of the workshop 
papers must be collected by the respective organisers till 
June 1st, 1994, be supplemented by an opening 
summary (similar in length to the workshop papers) and 
forwarded to Herbert Stoyan (s.f.) by June 17th, 1994.

Workshop Scheduling
===================
All workshop participants must register for the KI-94. The 
local arrangement committee will provide venues, govern 
the organisation and coordinate the workshop curriculum. 
The workshop coordinators reserve the right to drop 
workshops that fail to organise within the set bounds.

18th German Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence

	Saarbr"ucken, September, 18-23, 1994

General Chairs: J"org Siekmann, DFKI, Univ. Saarbr"ucken
		Hans-J"urgen B"urckert, DFKI Saarbr"ucken

The scientific, as well as the economic importance of
Artificial Intelligence research has steadily
grown, even though in some degree, partly slower than
had been hoped for. AI research in Germany had a
belated start, but steadily improved in recent years. Today
the field is well established and some areas even play an
outstanding role internationally. This positive
development is accounted for in the forthcoming German
Conference on AI, which is especially broadly based,
aiming at researchers, university students, users and
practitioners in industry alike.

The German Conference on Artificial Intelligence is
traditionally organised once a year by the AI-section of the
German Society for Computer Science (GI). This is one of
the four subdivisions of the GI and today the AI section has
more than four thousand members. In 1994, the conference will
be carried out at the University of Saarland in Saarbr"ucken
by the German Research Center of AI (DFKI), the Computer
Science Department (FBI), the Institute of Computer
Linguistics (CoLi) and the Max Planck Institute for
Computer Science (MPI). It comprises a Scientific
Conference, from the 18th to 22nd of September 1994,
and an Industrial Congress on the 22nd and 23rd of
September 1994. Tutorials will be offered on Sunday the
18th, scientific talks form Tuesday to Thursday in the
morning and workshops in the afternoon.

On Monday a symposium will be held, covering a selected
topic, the "International Symposium on Logics in Artificial
Intelligence", chaired by Dov Gabbay (Imperial College
London) and J"org Siekmann (DFKI, University of Saarland).
Invited speakers will give lectures on current issues
pertaining to this context. This is prompted by the
publication of the multivolume "Handbook of Logics in
Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming".

The Industrial Congress offers a multifaceted programme
which demonstrates how AI is put into industrial practice:
talks on areas of applications of AI, consulting service
offers from the German AI-Institutes' association (AKI) and
an AI Exhibition.

Contributions to the Scientific Conference and the
Industrial Congress will be published in a set of Springer-
Verlag conference publications. KI-94 will be supported
by an advisory board consisting of the previous and future
chair persons, as well as representatives from Industry
and University.

18th German Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence

	Saarbr"ucken, September, 18-23, 1994

General Chairs: J"org Siekmann, DFKI, Univ. Saarbr"ucken		
		Hans-J"urgen B"urckert, DFKI Saarbr"ucken

The scientific, as well as the economic importance of 
Artificial Intelligence research has steadily 
grown, even though in some degree, partly slower than 
had been hoped for. AI research in Germany had a 
belated start, but steadily improved in recent years. Today 
the field is well established and some areas even play an 
outstanding role internationally. This positive 
development is accounted for in the forthcoming German 
Conference on AI, which is especially broadly based, 
aiming at researchers, university students, users and 
practitioners in industry alike.

The German Conference on Artificial Intelligence is 
traditionally organised once a year by the AI-section of the 
German Society for Computer Science (GI). This is one of 
the four subdivisions of the GI and today the AI section has
more than four thousand members. In 1994, the conference will 
be carried out at the University of Saarland in Saarbr"ucken 
by the German Research Center of AI (DFKI), the Computer 
Science Department (FBI), the Institute of Computer 
Linguistics (CoLi) and the Max Planck Institute for 
Computer Science (MPI). It comprises a Scientific 
Conference, from the 18th to 22nd of September 1994, 
and an Industrial Congress on the 22nd and 23rd of 
September 1994. Tutorials will be offered on Sunday the 
18th, scientific talks form Tuesday to Thursday in the 
morning and workshops in the afternoon.

On Monday a symposium will be held, covering a selected 
topic, the "International Symposium on Logics in Artificial 
Intelligence", chaired by Dov Gabbay (Imperial College 
London) and J"org Siekmann (DFKI, University of Saarland). 
Invited speakers will give lectures on current issues 
pertaining to this context. This is prompted by the 
publication of the multivolume "Handbook of Logics in 
Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming".

The Industrial Congress offers a multifaceted programme 
which demonstrates how AI is put into industrial practice: 
talks on areas of applications of AI, consulting service 
offers from the German AI-Institutes' association (AKI) and 
an AI Exhibition.

Contributions to the Scientific Conference and the 
Industrial Congress will be published in a set of Springer-
Verlag conference publications. KI-94 will be supported 
by an advisory board consisting of the previous and future 
chair persons, as well as representatives from Industry 
and University.

Papers are also welcome, which investigate the principles 
and problems involved when AI is put into practice. 
Contributions though, which describe commercial AI 
applications should be submitted to the Industrial 
Congress.

Submissions to the scientific program must be original, 
neither, published or accepted for publication elsewhere, 
nor currently going through a review process at another 
conference (with exception of specialised workshops). 
Accepted submissions will appear in the Springer 
"Lecture Notes in AI" and therefore must be written in 
English.

Posters and System Demos at the Scientific Conference
=====================================================
Research groups and scientists will be given the 
opportunity through posters and system demos to 
present current AI-projects and AI-systems. These 
contributions will be reviewed by the program committee 
as well, and will appear along with the papers in the LNAI.

Submission Details for the Scientific Conference
=================================================
Papers and proposals for posters should be sent in six (6) 
copies to one of the two program chairs (s.f.) till April 
8th, 1994. Papers received after that date cannot be 
considered. Fax or e-mail submissions are also 
unacceptable.

The papers should be clearly legible and written in 12 
point type. The length of a paper should not exceed 16 
pages with roughly 38 lines/page and 75 characters per 
line (corresponding to the standard LaTex article-style), 
including bibliography and appendix. The title page is 
separate.

Proposals for posters and system demos require the 
submision of a one- to three-page summary of the 
presentation (adding diagramms if necessary).

The title page should show the title of the contribution, 
the catagory (paper, poster or system demo), the names 
of all authors with postal and e-mail addresses. In addition, 
the title page should contain an abstract, of not more than 
200 words, supplemented by keywords which 
characterise the contribution's content.

In order to facilitate the review process, the contents of 
the title page should be sent till April 8th via e-mail to

	ki-94-abstract@dfki.uni-sb.de

using only plain ASCII text. The order of content in this 
message should be

TITLE:<title> 
AUTHOR:<name of first author> 
ADDRESS:<address of first author> 
AUTHOR:<second author> 
..... 
AREA:<area> 
KEYWORDS:<keywords> 
ABSTRACT:<summary>

Review Process
==============
All submitted papers, proposals for posters and system 
demos will be reviewed by at least two members of the 
program committee.

The main criteria underlying the judgment of papers are 
the achieved results, originality, technical quality and 
presentation. Proposals for posters and system demos 
are judged against their AI-context and quality of 
presentation. The authors will be informed of the program 
committee's decision by May 20th.

Publication
===========
Accepted papers will be allocated 12 pages in the 
conference proceedings , which will be published in the 
Springer LNAI series. Each accepted poster and system 
demo will have one page reserved in the conference 
proceedings for a summary of its presentation. A camera-
ready copy must be submitted to one of the program 
chairs by June 17th, 1994.

	=========================
	===  KI-94 Workshops  ===
	=========================

Chairs: J"urgen Kunze, HU Berlin		
	Herbert Stoyan, Universit"at Erlangen

The Workshops take place in the afternoon on 
September 20th and 22th. A workshop should discuss 
current problems in applications of AI and basic research. 
Its participants will be working on these problems and will 
share a common interest in an interchange with equally 
inclined persons or those active in similar areas. However, 
this should not entail lengthy papers. Problems should 
be well focused; extensive topics are not suitable. All 
users, researchers and producers in the field of AI who 
are interested in an intensive discussion should submit 
an appropriate proposal.

Submission of Workshop Proposals
================================
A group of 25 active participants is envisaged. The 
Workshops should be made, if possible, accessible to 
other conference attendees. The workshop organisers 
will decide for themselves the conditions for attendance 
and possible papers, which are required. Ample time 
should be set out for general discussion. The total 
duration of such a workshop will cover two to three 
afternoons (4 hour tracks each). The "Extended 
Abstracts" of the workshop contributions will be 
published in a second volume, the general workshop 
proceedings.

Proposals for Workshops, of about two pages in length, 
should contain:

 -  Workshop topic. This can be subdivided concisely into 
    specific problems.
 -  Name of the workshop.
 -  A brief explanation why the workshop is of particular 
    interest at this time.
 -  The names and addresses of the organising committee. 
    The three to four members should be knowledgeable 
    in their fields, preferably bringing in a differing of 
    perspectives to the workshop topic. This should be 
    reflected in the proposal.
 -  An indication of likely schedule and time involved and if 
    possible a list of likely attendees.

Workshop proposals will gain merit, which tackle 
controversial issues, which speed scientific advances and 
support the formation and testing of theoretical results 
and their transfer into practical applications.

The workshop proposals must be submitted as soon as 
possible, at the latest by December 3rd,1993. Organisers 
will produce a call for workshop participation and submit 
this by January 14th, 1993. This call will be released in the 
first edition of the 1994 German AI-journal. Further 
distribution of this call lies in the organisers' hands.

Workshop Participants
=====================
Organisers decide workshop attendance on the basis of 
submissions and required contributions, which they must 
receive by May 1st, 1994. Attendees must be notified by 
May 15th, 1994. A one to two page document containing 
an attendance list, the programme and a brief description 
of the workshop must be sent till May 1st, 1994 to one of 
the workshop coordinators (s.f.). The contents will be 
published in a special edition of the German AI-journal.

Publication of Workshop Contributions
=====================================
Abstracts of all Workshop contributions will appear in a 
seperate workshop volume which, along with the other 
conference proceeding's volumes, will be handed out to 
each participant. The abstracts will amount to two pages in 
length (including title, authors and bibliography) using 12 
point type, and each page having roughly 38 lines with 75 
characters per line. The revised copies of the workshop 
papers must be collected by the respective organisers till 
June 1st, 1994, be supplemented by an opening 
summary (similar in length to the workshop papers) and 
forwarded to Herbert Stoyan (s.f.) by June 17th, 1994.

Workshop Scheduling
===================
All workshop participants must register for the KI-94. The 
local arrangement committee will provide venues, govern 
the organisation and coordinate the workshop curriculum. 
The workshop coordinators reserve the right to drop 
workshops that fail to organise within the set bounds. 
Workshops shall not be used as a forum for marketing 
hard- and software products.
