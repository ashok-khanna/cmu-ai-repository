			CALL FOR PAPERS

		TEACHING AND LANGUAGE CORPORA 94

	    Lancaster University 11 - 13th April 1994

			Aims of the Conference

While the use of computer text corpora in research is now well
established, they are now being used increasingly for teaching
purposes.  This includes the use of corpus data to inform and create
teaching materials; it also includes the direct exploration of corpora
by students, both in the study of linguistics and in the study of a
foreign language.  We would like to bring together researchers and
teachers who are involved in such work in order to encourage an
international exchange of current experience and expertise.

Papers are invited on the following topics

- the uses of corpora in the teaching of linguistics
- the uses of corpora in the teaching of a foreign language
- software for the use of corpora in teaching
- corpus annotation
- issues concerning funding and resourcing
- availability of corpora
- necessary skills (teacher and learner) for exploiting corpora
- applications of spoken corpora
- computational linguistics

By "corpora" we mean:

- corpora of written and spoken language
- parallel corpora (collections of the same text in more than one language)
- translation corpora

			Format for Submission

The conference will be composed of oral and poster presentations. To
be considered, you need to submit an abstract of your intended paper
by no later than 30th September 1993 for a poster. If you want to
