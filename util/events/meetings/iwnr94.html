			 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
	  5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON NONMONOTONIC REASONING
			   May 29--June 1, 1994
	    Castle Dagstuhl, near Saarbrucken, Germany

The Fifth International Workshop on Nonmonotonic Reasoning will be
held May 29--June 1, 1994, at Castle Dagstuhl near Saarbrucken.  The
aim of the workshop is to bring together active researchers interested
in the area of nonmonotonic reasoning to discuss current research,
results, and problems of both a theoretical and practical nature.  The
field of nonmonotonic reasoning includes work on circumscription,
autoepistemic and default logic, truth maintenance, closed-world
databases, logic programming, probabilistic reasoning, and related
formal systems and application areas.

Because of the conference on knowledge representation and reasoning
(KR-94) to be held the previous week in Bonn, the format of this
workshop will be somewhat different from previous ones.  There will be
an increased focus on panel discussions; individual paper
presentations will be restricted to position papers of the form not
generally accepted at large conferences.  Where possible, the panels
will be organized around these position papers or around groups of
related results presented at KR-94.  By a "position paper," we mean a
paper that discusses the significance of already known concepts or
results, explains the interest and potential of current directions of
research, or speculates on notions and questions that lie ahead.

Attendance will be limited and by invitation only.  Space permitting,
at least one author of each accepted KR-94 paper dealing with
nonmonotonic reasoning will be invited.  Others wishing to attend
should submit a short description of their past accomplishments and
current research interests.  Position papers should be limited to 4000
words; papers of greater length or papers that are clearly more
suitable for conference submission will be rejected without review.
Panel suggestions are also welcome.

A limited number of spaces will be reserved for students, and student
lodging and travel subsidies will hopefully be available.  Students
should indicate their university and year of study, and include
letters of recommendation from their supervisors.

Please include your postal (and, if possible, electronic mail)
addresses on all correspondence.  Submissions may be either hardcopy
(4 copies) or electronic (postscript files only) to either of the
program chairs:
