                                CALL FOR PAPERS

The A.I. duPont Institute and the Universiy of Delaware are pleased to sponsor
 the 4th ICORR Conference in Wilmington, Delaware on June 15 & 16, 1994. ICORR
 `94, to be held in conjunction with the International Service Robotics
 Association (ISRA), will provide a platform for researchers, clinicians,
 manufacturers, and consumers to exchange ideas and gather information on the
 latest advances in rehabilitation robotics. The theme of this year's conference
 will be "Robots for Consumers". In addition to traditional research papers,
 participants are encouraged to submit posters summarizing overall institutional
 activities. The conference will also feature exhibits and demonstrations of
 robotic hardware and software. ICORR `94 has been scheduled immediately
 preceding RESNA in hopes that participants can take advantage of the diversity
 and professional benefits of both meetings.

Abstracts of 400 words or less for ICORR `94 papers or posters must be
 postmarked by November 15, 1993. Authors will be notified of abstract
 acceptance by December 15, 1993. Final papers (6 page limit) will be due in
 February, 1994 for publication in the Conference Proceedings. Paper topics may
 include, but are not limited to:

Safety

Teleoperation

Assessment

Design for manufacture

Modeling and control

Education

Technology transfer

Human/machine interface

Marketing issues
