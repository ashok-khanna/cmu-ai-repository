CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT

COMPUTING IN AEROSPACE 9
San Diego, California - Oct. 19-21, 1993
Princess Resort on Mission Bay

Sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)

Computing in Aerospace is the premier conference for exchange of technical
information, plans, and visions among the aerospace computing community,
including industry, government, and universities.  The conference theme is
"Advancing the State of the Practice - Applications and Commercialization
of
Technology."  The conference will include 6 parallel tracks, 60 paper and
panel
sessions, and over 260 paper presentations in nearly every aspect of
aerospace
computing.

A full conference program and registration forms were published in the
July 1993 edition of Aerospace America.  A program and registration
forms may be obtained by contacting the AIAA Meetings Department at
202-646-7463.  Additional information about the conference may be
obtained by contacting Mark Gersh (mgersh@nasamail.nasa.gov,
202-358-4527), Don Rosenthal (rosenthal@kronos.arc.nasa.gov,
415-604-3367), or Allan Jaworski (jaw@groucho.aerosys.loral.com,
301-805-0533).

Vendors and other organizations interested in exhibition space should
contact
Melinda Howell at 202-646-7467.  Exhibit arrangements are flexible and can
accommodate both major vendor presentations and table-top demonstrations of
systems described in conference papers.  An evening reception will be held
in
the exhibit hall to ensure maximum visibility of exhibits.

OUTSTANDING LOCATION

The San Diego Princess Resort is located in the center of San Diego, on a
forty-four-acre island in Mission Bay, ten minutes from San Diego
Intercontinental Airport. Comfortable guest rooms, spacious conference
facilities, excellent restaurants, recreational and exercise facilities,
and a
spectacular garden setting will provide the perfect environment for
Computing
in Aerospace 9.  A special conference rate of $105 for a single/double room
has
been negotiated and will be held for conference attendees until Sept. 17.
Rooms at the current per diem rate are available for Government employees.
Call 800-344-2626 or 619-274-4630 for reservations.
