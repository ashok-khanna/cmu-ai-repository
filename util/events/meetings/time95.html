                                TIME-95:
      Second International Workshop on Temporal Representation and Reasoning
                    (in conjunction with FLAIRS-95)


                       Melbourne Beach, Florida, USA
                               April 26, 1995

                             CALL FOR PAPERS

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together active researchers in the area
of temporal representation and reasoning in Artificial Intelligence.  Through
paper presentations and discussions, the participants will exchange, compare,
and contrast results in the area. The workshop is planned as a one-day event to
immediately precede FLAIRS-95 (Eighth Annual Florida Artificial Intelligence
Research Symposium, April 27-29). Workshop participants are also encouraged to
submit papers to FLAIRS and attend the conference. The workshop will be
conducted as a combination of paper presentations, a poster session, an invited
talk, and a panel discussion. The format will provide ample time for discussions
and exchange of ideas. The workshop registration fee will be waived for those
who register for FLAIRS-95. Submission of high quality papers or extended
abstracts describing mature results or on-going work are invited for all areas
of temporal representation and reasoning, including, but not limited to:

                temporal logics and ontologies
                temporal languages and architectures
                planning, actions, and events
                frame problem
                continuous versus discrete time
                point versus interval representations
                temporal knowledge, belief, and uncertainty
                temporal learning and discovery
                multiple agents, communication, and synchronization
                foundational issues and applications

To maximize interaction among participants, the size of the workshop will be
limited. Accepted papers will be invited for full presentation or a poster
presentation. All submissions must be received by November 10, 1994.
Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to the first author (or
designated author) on February 1, 1995. Prospective participants should submit
5 copies of a 5-8 page extended abstract to:
        TIME-95,
        Department of Computer Science,
        University of Regina,
        Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada S4S 0A2.

                              PUBLICATION

All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings. As well, a
selected subset of the papers will be invited for inclusion (subject to
refereeing) in a special issue of a journal.
