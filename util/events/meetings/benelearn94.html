                              BENELEARN-94

              4th Belgian-Dutch Conference on Machine Learning

                            10 juni 1994

                      Erasmus University Rotterdam


First Anouncement and Call for Papers

General Information:

BENELEARN is the annual conference on machine learning in Belgium and
The Netherlands. This conference provides a forum for researchers 
from these two countries to present their latest work. It also
present an opportunity to communicate with others. 
The selected papers will be published in the Proceedings of Benelearn-94.
They will appear in the report series of the  of Computer Science Department 
of the Erasmus University.  

Program:

The scientific program consists of invited talks on Symbolic Machine Learning
and Genetic Algorithms/Neural Networks, and two parallel sessions for
presentation of submitted papers.

Submission:
Papers in all areas of Machine Learning are sollicited, including, but
not limited to:

        Abduction                            Neural Networks
        Applications of Machine Learning     Inductive Learning
        Computational Learning               Inductive Logic Programming
        Genetic Algorithms                   Multistrategy Learning 

Especially papers on applications in all areas of Machine Learning,
particularly Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks are encouraged.
Full papers are limited to 12 pages including title page and references.
Deadline: May 10th, 1994
