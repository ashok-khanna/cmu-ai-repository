THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION, ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE APPLIED TO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND LABORATORY MEDICINE

                   January 25-28, 1994
                    Pan Pacific Hotel,
                      San Diego CA

After   the success of   the two   first   editions held in  Montreux,
Switzerland, the International Conference  on Automation, Robotics and
Artificial Intelligence applied to Analytical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine moves to the West Coast of the US for its third edition.

Short courses will be given on January 25, the day preceding the
symposium.

Subjects of general interest will be introduced by plenary lectures
followed by brief research presentations.

Participants will have the opportunity to attend selected lectures
related to their field of interest and participate in discussion
sessions.

An exhibition and a poster presentation will be held in a room
adjacent to the conference room.  Instruments and applications will be
displayed by manufacturers and users.
