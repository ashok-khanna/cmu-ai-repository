               INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP
         ON THE DESIGN OF COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS

              25th - 27th January 1995
               Juan-les-Pins,  France


OBJECTIVES

A growing  number of  system  designers  consider that 
the  problem solving capabilities of the human-machine 
couple are  more important than the performance of the 
system  alone.   This view  mandates that  the design, 
validation and maintenance of  such systems utilize an 
interdisciplinary approach and  that new concepts need
to be defined to understand the characteristics of the
cooperation  between the artificial  and human agents.
The aim of this workshop is to review the state of the 
art in the  field of cooperative systems.  The program 
committee is  seeking for original papers in all areas 
concerning the  design of  cooperative systems. Topics 
of interest include:

o  Methodologies for the analysis of functional speci-
   fications, knowledge acquisition and  validation of 
   cooperative systems,

o  Cooperation models and their use in design,

o  Cooperative systems architecture,

o  Communication  in  cooperative  systems  (dialogues, 
   negotiation, explanations and user models),

o  Theoretical contributions or empirical studies  from
   Cognitive Psychology and Ergonomy, Distributed Arti-
   ficial Intelligence,OrganizationalSciences, Decision
   Analysis,Group Decision Support Systems and Groupware.

Papers should either describe  significant results from 
ongoing research or user experience or offer new contri-
butions to  theories and  methodologies for cooperative 
system design, as well as techniques and tools.
