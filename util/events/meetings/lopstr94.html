  This workshop is the fourth one after LOPSTR'91 and '92 in 
Manchester (U.K.) and LOPSTR'93 in Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgium).
This time the workshop will take place in Pisa (Italy) the  week after 
ICLP'94 (S.Margherita Ligure - Italy) and in conjunction with META'94.
The two workshops will be in the same location and will be run in
parallel. The two workshops will share invited lectures of general interest.

  The aim of the workshop is to present recent work (including work in
progress), and to discuss new ideas and trends in logic program synthesis,
transformation, and development, as well as in related fields such as
inductive logic programming and automated verification of logic program 
properties.  This workshop is also intended to bring together researchers 
active in these areas, and is a good opportunity for researchers working
in related areas to get an overview of the current state of the art.


SUBMISSION
----------
  Authors should submit 5 copies of an EXTENDED ABSTRACT by JANUARY 10, 1994. 
These extended abstracts should be no longer than 5,000 words (excluding
references), and should clearly explain the interest of the approach by 
comparing with appropriate related work.  Submission of abstracts by email 
is also accepted (LaTeX or Postscript). The accepted abstracts will be 
collected into preliminary proceedings, which will be available at the 
workshop.

  Extended abstracts can be completed into full papers after the workshop, 
and will be reviewed for publication in the final LOPSTR'94 proceedings 
(which are expected to be published by Springer-Verlag).


DEADLINES
---------
  January  10, 1994: Submission of LOPSTR extended abstracts
  March  20, 1994: Notification of acceptance/rejection for presentation
                   at the workshop.

The deadlines for the post-workshop submission of LOPSTR full papers,
notification of acceptance/rejection, and production of camera-ready version
for the LOPSTR'94 proceedings are  July 30, September 6, and October 1, 1994.
