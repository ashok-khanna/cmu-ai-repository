CALL FOR PAPERS

SYMPOSIUM ON AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY

July 19-20 1994

            
The IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society is sponsoring a symposium on 
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology to be held in the 
Boston, MA. area  at the Cambridge Center Marriott Hotel on 
July 19-20 1994.  The objective of the Symposium is to disseminate 
knowledge of recent technological advances in the field, to be a 
focus for the current state of the art including identification of 
technology shortfalls and to provide a forum for discussion of 
new relevant ideas.

TOPICS

The Symposium will focus on topics that are related to the 
AUTONOMOUS OPERATION OF UNDERWATER VEHICLES.  These 
include but are not limited to :

	Sensors and Multi-Sensor Fusion
	Communications and Telemetry
	Navigation		
	Imaging Techniques and Systems
	Modeling and Simulation Methods
	Mission Control and Software Architectures
	Energy Systems 		
	Autonomous Manipulation
	Vehicle Design and Control	
	Launch and Recovery Techniques and Issues
	Multiple Cooperating Vehicles		

The Symposium will include a VIDEO PROCEEDINGS Session and visits to 
area technical attractions including the C. S. Draper Laboratories.  

ABSTRACTS

Prospective authors should submit a proposed title and an abstract 
(300-500 words) with a cover sheet containing title author(s) names, 
addresses with one author named as the point of contact including 
phone and fax numbers.  Since acceptance is by review of abstracts, 
it would be helpful if authors would describe the problem addressed 
solutions obtained and its importance to the subject of the 
conference.  Abstracts should be submitted to :
