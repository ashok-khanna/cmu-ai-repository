The Tenth International Conference on Mathematical and Computer 
Modelling and Scientific Computing is scheduled to take place 5-8 July 
1995 at the Boston Marriott Hotel Copley Place in Boston, 
Massachusetts, U.S.A.  Plenary lectures by world-renowned scientists 
and technical sessions on many recent developments in engineering and 
sciences comprise a long-standing tradition at the ICMCM's.  The 
objective of the conference is to bring together researchers, educators, 
planners, and model users from various disciplines including the 
traditional and emerging areas of engineering and sciences for cross 
fertilization and exchange of information.  Authors are invited to 
contribute their work for presentation at the conference in the form of 
one-page abstracts typed single-space before 15 December 1994.  Early 
submissions are encouraged.  The abstracts will be processed as they 
come in, and decisions on selection will be promptly communicated to 
the authors by FAX not later than 31 January 1995.  Abstracts may be 
submitted by FAX by dialing to U.S.A.: (314)-364-3351.

                       -------------------------

The topics of interest are broadly categorized into:

     Modelling and Computation in Engineering and Sciences; 
     Computational Sciences and Technologies;
