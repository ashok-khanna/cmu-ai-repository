      KBSE-8: 8th Knowledge-Based Software 
	    Engineering Conference
	    Call for Participation

       Sponsored by Rome Laboratory, USAF

     In cooperation with AAAI, IEEE and ACM

	   September 20 - 23, 1993
	     Chicago, Illinois

The 1993 Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference 
will provide a forum for researchers, practitioners, and 
developers to exchange ideas and results regarding the 
application of artificial intelligence and knowledge-based 
techniques to all aspects of software development.  The 
Conference scope covers all activities related to software, 
including planning, domain modeling,  reuse, specification, 
design, coding, documentation, evaluation, prototyping, testing, 
maintenance, and re/reverse engineering. 

TUTORIALS

The three day conference will be proceeded by a day of tutorials.
There will be three tutorials given, in parallel, on Monday, September
20, 1993.  The following is a brief description of each along with a 
biography of the presentor.

A Survey of Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (half day)
W. Lewis Johnson
USC / Information Sciences Institute
johnson@isi.edu

This tutorial is intended to give attendees an understanding of the
key concepts in knowledge-based software engineering.  It will
identify software engineering tasks that are amenable to
knowledge-based solutions, and categorize the various types of
knowledge-based systems that may be developed.  The current state of
the art in KBSE research and development will then be examined, in
each area of software engineering.  The key technologies currently
being used in these solutions will then be examined in detail.  The
tutorial will also place Rome Laboratory's Knowledge-Based Software
Assistant program in the overall context of knowledge-based software
engineering.

Dr. Johnson is Project Leader and Research Assistant Professor at the
University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.  He
has been active in KBSE research for a number of years.  He was chair of the
KBSE'92 conference, and is a member of the KBSE steering committee.
He is currently co-editor-in-chief of the journal Automated Software
Engineering: The International Journal for Artificial Intelligence and
Automated Reasoning in Software Engineering.  He conducts research
in a several areas in artificial intelligence relating to man-machine
collaborative problem solving.

======================================================================

KIDS: An Algorithm Synthesis System (full day)
Douglas R. Smith
Kestrel Institute
email: smith@kestrel.edu

Dr. Smith will outline a formal model of the software development
process being developed at Kestrel Institute.  This model uses
concepts from mathematical logic to represent application domains,
software specifications, and knowledge about algorithms, data
structures, optimization techniques, and software architectures.  He
will discuss how these representations are composed to produce
executable code.

KIDS (Kestrel Interactive Development System) is a state-of-the-art
synthesis system supporting many aspects of this formal model of
software development.  Dr. Smith will describe the system and plans
for its future development.  The synthesis of a scheduler will be used
as an illustration.

======================================================================

A Knowledge-Based Approach To Software Process Engineering (full day)
Walt Scacchi
University of Southern California
Scacchi@pollux.usc.edu

Process  integration  represents  the  ability  to  model  and execute software
development processes users should follow when using software engineering tools
or  environments.  CASE  and KBSE environments that support process integration
can guide people working  in  different  development  roles  in  their  use  of
CASE/KBSE  tools,  as  well  as  in  using these tools to model, prototype, and
develop software  application  systems  and  related  documentation.    Process
integration  also  provides  a strategy for how to best exploit tool, data, and
presentation integration mechanisms, together with process asset  repositories.
This   tutorial  describes  techniques  used  for  modeling,  integrating,  and
executing  software  development   processes   with   process-integrated   KBSE
environments,  as  well  as  present  examples  that  help  to  show  how these
techniques and environments operate. It also describes experiences with the use
of  these  process  integration  capabilities  in  both research and industrial
settings. Finally, it describes  current  research  efforts  that  continue  to
advance  our  knowledge  of  the design and practice of process-integrated KBSE
environments.

Walt Scacchi received a Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science at University
of  California, Irvine in 1981. He is currently an associate research professor
in the Information and Operations Management Dept. at USC.  Since  joining  the
faculty  at  USC  in  1981,  he  created and continues to direct the USC System
Factory Project.  This was the first software factory  research  project  in  a
U.S.  university.  Dr.  Scacchi's  research  interests  include knowledge-based
systems for modeling and simulating software processes, CASE  technologies  for
developing  large  heterogeneous  information  systems,  large  scale  software
production, software technology transfer  and  transition,  and  organizational
analysis  of system development projects. Dr. Scacchi is a member of ACM, IEEE,
AAAI, Computing Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), and Society for
the History of Technology (SHOT).  He is an active researcher with more than 70
research publications, and numerous consulting and visiting scientist positions
with  firms  including  AT&T  Bell  Laboratories, Microelectronics and Computer
Technology Corporation (MCC), Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon
University,  SUN  Microsystems,  Perceptronics,  Hewlett-Packard,  and Andersen
Consulting.
