              Workshop on Programming in Goedel
              ---------------------------------

         University of Manchester, 14-15 April, 1994
         --------------------------------------------

                 First Call for Participation
                 ----------------------------

Goedel is a new declarative, general-purpose programming language 
in the family of logic programming languages. It is a strongly 
typed language, the type system being based on many-sorted logic 
with parametric polymorphism. It also has a module system.
Goedel supports infinite precision integers, infinite precision 
rationals, and also floating point numbers. It can solve constraints
over finite domains of integers and also linear rational constraints.
It supports processing of finite sets. It also has a flexible 
computation rule and pruning operator which generalises the commit
of concurrent logic programming languages. Considerable emphasis is
placed on Goedel's meta-logical facilities which provide significant 
support for meta-programs that do analysis, transformation,
compilation, verification, debugging, and so on.

Goedel should be of interest to researchers in program development, 
parallel language implementation, and the theory of logic programming, 
as well as teachers of logic programming.

The workshop at Manchester is sponsored by ALP UK. It will be run by 
the team that developed Goedel, consisting of John Lloyd, Pat Hill, 
Antony Bowers, Jiwei Wang, and Corin Curr. The workshop will mainly 
consist of talks describing the Goedel language and its implementation 
together with programming practice sessions. In addition, some of the 
participants with experience of using Goedel in teaching or in 
developing applications programs in Goedel will describe their work.
