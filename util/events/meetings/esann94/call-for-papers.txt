                        European Symposium
                  on Artificial Neural Networks

                 Brussels - April 20-21-22, 1994

             First announcement and call for papers

Scope of the conference
-----------------------

ESANN'93 was held in Brussels, in April 1993.  It gathered more than 80
scientists, from about 15 countries, who wanted to learn more about the last
developments in the theory of neural networks.

The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks will be organized for the
second time in April 1994, and, as in 1993, will focus on the fundamental
aspects of the artificial neural network research.  Today, thousands of
researchers work in this field; they try to develop new algorithms, to mimic
properties found in natural networks, to develop parallel computers based on
these properties, and to use artificial neural networks in new application
areas.  But the field is new, and has expanded drastically in about ten years;
this lead to a lack of theoretical works in the subject, and also to a lack of
comparisons between new methods and more classical ones.

The purpose of ESANN is to cover the theoretical and fundamental aspects of
neural networks; the symposium is intended to give to the participants an
up-to-date and comprehensive view of these aspects, by the presentation of new
results and new developments, of tutorial papers covering the relations between
neural networks and classical methods of computing, and also by round tables
confronting views of specialists and non-specialists of the field.  The program
committee of ESANN'94 welcomes papers in the following aspects of artificial
neural networks :
. theory
. models and architectures
. mathematics
. learning algorithms
. biologically plausible artificial networks
. neurobiological systems
. adaptive behavior
. signal processing
. statistics
. self-organization
. evolutive learning
Accepted papers will cover new results in one or several of these aspects or
will be of tutorial nature.  Papers insisting on the relations between
artificial neural networks and classical methods of information processing,
signal processing or statistics are encouraged.


----------------------
Call for contributions
----------------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit six originals of their contribution
before November 26, 1993.  Working language of the conference (including
proceedings) is English.

Papers should not exceed six A4 pages (including figures and references). 
Printing area will be 12.2 x 19.3 cm (centered on the A4 page); left, right,
top and bottom margins will thus respectively be 4.4, 4.4, 5.2 and 5.2 cm.
10-point Times font will be used for the main text; headings will be in bold
characters, (but not underlined), and will be separated from the main text by
two blank lines before and one after.  Manuscripts prepared in this format will
be reproduced in the same size in the book.  

The first page will begin by a heading, indented 1cm left and right with
regards to the main text (the heading will thus have left and right margins of
5.4 cm).  The heading will contain the title (Times 14 point, bold, centered),
one blank line, the author(s) name(s) (Times 10 point, centered), one blank
line, the affiliation (Times 9 point, centered), one blank line, and the
abstract (Times 9 point, justified, beginning by the word "Abstract." in bold
face).

Originals of the figures will be pasted into the manuscript and centered
between the margins.  The lettering of the figures should be in 10-point Times
font size.  Figures should be numbered.  The legends also should be centered
between the margins and be written in 9-point Times font size as follows:

The pages of the manuscript will not be numbered (numbering decided by the
editor).

A separate page (not included in the manuscript) will indicate:
. the title of the manuscript
. author(s) name(s)
. the complete address (including phone & fax numbers and E-mail) of the
corresponding author
. a list of five keywords or topics
On the same page, the authors will copy and sign the following paragraph:
"in case of acceptation of the paper for presentation at ESANN 94:
- at least one of the authors will register to the conference and will present
the paper
- the author(s) give their rights up over the paper to the organizers of ESANN
94, for the proceedings and any publication that could directly be generated by
the conference
- if the paper does not match the format requirements for the proceedings, the
author(s) will send a revised version within two weeks of the notification of
acceptation."

Contributions must be sent to the conference secretariat.  Prospective authors
are invited to ask examples of camera-ready contributions by writing to the
same address.

Local details
-------------

The conference will be held in the center of Brussels (Belgium).  Close to most
great European cities, Brussels is exceptionally well served by closely-knit
motorway and railway systems, and an international airport.  Besides an
artistic and cultural center of attraction, Brussels is also renowned for its
countless typical cafés, form the most unassuming to the most prestigious. 
Belgian food is typical and famous, and the night life in Brussels is
considerable.


---------
Deadlines
---------

Submission of papers	November 26, 1993
Notification of acceptance	January 17, 1994
Symposium	April 20-22, 1994


------
Grants
------

A limited number of grants (registration fees and economic accommodation) will
be given to young scientists coming from the European Community (Human Capital
and Mobility program, European Community - DG XII).  Grants will also probably
be available for scientists from Central and Eastern European countries. 
Please write to the conference secretariat to get an application form for these
grants.
