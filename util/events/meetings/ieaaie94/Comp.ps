                         TUTORIAL & WORKSHOP PROGRAM

Tuesday Morning, May 31,1994

(W) WORKSHOP                8:30 - 12:30

Workshop on Formalisms for Representing
and Reasoning about Time
Organized by Helen Gill of Mitre Corp. and NSF, VA,
and Steve Seidman of Auburn University, AL

For over a decade, formal methods have been used with great
success to specify and verify concurrent and distributed systems.
In recent years, many research groups have extended these
methods to incorporate time and have used the timed methods to
model time-critical concurrent systems. An alternative approach
to specifying and verifying time-critical systems is based on
developing logics that explicitly incorporate time. The techniques
used to represent and reason about time in these formalisms are
quite varied. The papers included in this special session were
selected to provide an overview of a broad range of recent work
on timed models of concurrent systems. The session will end with
a discussion of current trends in this area by a panel of
distinguished researchers.

Papers will be presented by D. Clarke and I. Lee (University of
Pennsylvania); L. Dillon and Q. Yu, (University of California,
Santa Barbara); T. Henzinger and P. Ho (Cornell University); M.
Mislove (Tulane University); J. Quemada, D. de Frutos, and C.
Miguel (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid). and J. Tsai
(University of Illinois at Chicago).

The members of the panel are Rance Cleaveland (North
Carolma State University); E. A. Emerson (University of Texas).
A. Mok (University of Texas); G. M. Reed (Oxford University):
Stephen Seidman (Auburn University, moderator).



(TI) TUTORIAL.                 8:30 - 12:30

Introduction to Neural Networks
Given by
Khosrow Kaikhah of Southwest Texas State University

Neural Networks, or Artificial Neural Systems (ANS), are a
combinatlon of Biology, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
Neural Networks mimic the functionality of the human brain and
can be classified into three categories:

        a. Associative Memory Networks
        b. Supervised Learning Networks
        c. Unsupervised Learning Networks

The tutorial introduces some of the terminologies,
architectures, and advances in this field. Similarities and
differences between Neural Networks and the human brain will
be pointed out by focusing on several examples of each category.


Tuesday Afternoon, May 31,1994

WORKSHOP PANEL DISCUSSION       1:30 - 3:15

Panel Discussion: R. Cleaveland, H. Gill, A. Emerson,
A. Mok, G.M. Reed, S. Seidman



(T2) TUTORIAL              1:30 - 5:00

Evolutionary Algorithms
Given by
Zbigniew Michalewicz of the
University of North Carolina, Charlotte

The tutorial will provide an overview of basic evolutionary
computation techniques and their applications.

During the last thirty years there has been a growing interest in
problem solving systems based on the principle of evolution.
Such systems maintain a population of potential solutions,
incorporate a selection process based on an extrinsically imposed
fitness of each individual, and include methods for creating
randomly perturbed variants of current trials. There is also a
growing interest in "non-standard" evolutionary computation
methods, as "pure" evolutionary computation techniques are
generally not the most successful optimization techniques.
Evolutionary methods have been successfully applied to a variety
of difficult problems, including numerical optimization, machine
learning, optimal control, cognitive modeling, classic operations
research problems, engineering design, robotics, and signal
processing.

(T3) TUTORIAL--             1:30 - 5:00

INVITED TALK                  8:30 - 9:30

Program Synthesis for Mathematical Modeling Applications

Program synthesis techniques have been applied to
automatically generate mathematical modeling programs from
high-level specifications. Using the Sinapse system, a modeler
can specify a set of governing partial differential equations and
select solution algorithms from a set of finite difference methods;
the system then produces reasonably efficient implementations in
either Fortran77, Connection Machine Fortran or C. Sinapse
includes object knowledge bases, a simple planning system, and
transformation rules. Most of the examples have been simulations
of sonic wave propagation, but the system is designed for
expansion into other applications and algorithms.

Background information:

Dr. Elaine Kant received her undergraduate degree in
Mathematics from M.I.T. and her Ph.D. in Computer Science
from Stanford University. She is a Fellow of the American
Association for Artificial Intelligence. Elaine has been with
Schlumberger since 1985, currently as a Senior Research
Scientist, in the Modeling and Simulation group at the
Schlumberger Laboratory for Computer Science (in Austin,
Texas). Before joining Schlumberger, she was an assistant
professor of Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Elaine's major research interests are in understanding and
supporting scientific problem solving and in understanding and
automating the design, implementation, and analysis of
algorithms and programs.

The field of artificial intelligence has developed broadly along
the lines of symbolic problem-solving approaches and trainable
connectionist or probabilistic approaches. The activity of the
human in the feedback loop, often neglected, has important
practical consequences as the interface makes possible a
synergistic guidance and complementarity between the best
capabilities in the biological and electronic systems. Some
aspects of this collaboration between human and machine, at the
interface, will be covered in this presentation.
