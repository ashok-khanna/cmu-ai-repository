     IEA/AIE-94 continues the tradition of emphasizing applications of
 artificial intelligence and expert/knowledge-based systems to engineering
 and industrial problems.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  Computer Aided Design/Manufacturing  Natural Language Processing
  Dependability & AI/ES                Neural Networks
  Distributed AI Architectures         Pattern Recognition
  Expert & Diagnostic Systems          Planning & Scheduling
  Intelligent Databases                Practical Applications
  Intelligent Interfaces               Reasoning Under Uncertainty
  Intelligent Tutoring                 Robotics
  Knowledge Acquisition                Sensor Fusion
  Knowledge Representation             Intelligent Software Development Tools
  Machine Learning                     System Dependability
  Machine Vision                       Temporal and Spatial Reasoning
  Model-Based & Qualitative Reasoning  Verification & Validation

     Authors are invited to submit four copies of papers, written in English,
 of up to 10 single-spaced pages, presenting the results of original research
 or innovative practical applications relevant to one or more of the listed
 areas of interest. Practical experiences with state-of-the-art AI
 methodologies are also acceptable when they reflect lessons of unique value
 to the conference attendees. Shorter works, up to 6 pages, to be presented
 in 10 minutes, may be submitted as short papers representing work in progress
 or suggesting possible research directions. (Please indicate "short paper"
 in the submission letter in this case.) Submissions should be received by
 the Program Chair by November 5, 1993. Notification of the review process
 will be made by January 22, 1994, and final copies of papers will be due
 for inclusion in the conference proceedings by February 22, 1994.
