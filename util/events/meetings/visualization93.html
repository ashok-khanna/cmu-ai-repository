Visualization '93 Workshops:

Participation in the workshops requires approval by the workshop
organizers. Please contact the workshop organizer directly to
indicate your interest. Participants are expected to prepare a short
paper that outlines their research and to provide data to be shared
by colleagues in the field. Participation is limited.

Workshop position statements must be received by the workshop
organizer by September 1. A registration form for the workshop
will be mailed to each workshop participant by the Registration
Chair by October 1. The fee for a one-day workshop is $100,
which includes breaks and lunch. Visualization '93 registration is

Workshop Description:

As the use of visualization increases, education about the field
becomes more and more important.  In this full day workshop, we
will discuss approaches to formal and informal education in
visualization.  Teaching visualization is challenging because of
the breadth of topic, the multi-disciplinary nature of the area, the
mixed backgrounds of potential student audiences, and the relative
scarcity of the types of instructional resources that are usually
available for more well-established areas.  This workshop presents
an opportunity for participants to share their solutions to these
problems, discuss related issues, and learn what their counterparts
are doing in the area of visualization education.  The primary goal
of the workshop is information exchange among a diverse group
of providers of visualization education.

The workshop will address the following issues:
% What are the essential topics to teach about visualization?
% Who are the target audiences for visualization education?
Researchers and students? Disciplines?
% What are different strategies for developing expertise in
visualization? Topics or Project Emphasis?
% What are the tradeoffs among different strategies?
% What resources are available for visualization education?
% What hardware, software, output are necessary to support
visualization education?



Workshop 2 (Full Day)
Monday, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm

Workshop Description:

Visualization is a powerful method for performing data analysis in
many disciplines, and like other data analysis tasks requires
different levels of decision-making processes. These decision-
making processes require knowledge and experience from
interdisciplinary areas such as data and visual representation, as
well as knowledge  of the functional characteristics of data
manipulation and visualization procedures, and software packages
that perform these procedures. Due to the heavy knowledge
requirements of current visualization systems, data analysis has
required a level of expertise that exceeds the qualifications of
ordinary data analysts or scientists.  Ideally, a visualization
analysis scenario must go through the steps of relevant data search
and retrieval, acquistion of user's task requirements, and then
production of useful data display plans or designs.  The three
fundamental areas that visualization systems inadequately handle
are: (1) Data Access, (2) Task Understanding, and (3) Visualization
Design processes. The design of  visualization systems that
intelligently handle these three issues is the focus of this one day
workshop.



Workshop 3 (Full Day)
Tuesday, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm
Visualization in Decision-Support

Workshop Description:

This workshop will bring together researchers from a number of
fields to share work on supporting the human decision maker under
conditions of less than perfect knowledge and less than perfect
criteria for a decision.  Its primary focus will be on visualization
methods that support this process.  The emphasis will be on visual
representations of problem sets that facilitate the perception of
patterns, relations, and exceptions in the representation itself.
Statistical or AI heuristic methods that present results in novel
graphic form will be considered.


Workshop 4 (Full Day)
Tuesday, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm
Database Issues for Data Visualization

	(508) 934-3384
	(508) 452-4298

Workshop Description:

Data Visualization deals with the effective portrayal of data with a
goal towards insight about the data. Typically, the data is of high
volume,  multidimensional in nature, and does not lend itself to
easy display. The data is also often spatial and temporal in nature.

Database issues for data visualization have become increasingly important as
ever-larger data set sizes and dimensionality create problems that present-day
systems cannot handle. Collaborative computing requires multiple users
accessing multiple, heterogeneous databases. To explore relationships between
many data variables, researchers must be able to query data in meaningful
ways. Currently, visualization system users are only given minimal querying
support, limited in most cases to interaction with output data represent-
ations, or single-valued data probes. This workshop intends to deal with
issues specifically related to the integration of database management sys-
tems with data visualization in hopes of determining methods for supplying
end users with the data interaction support they require, and overcoming
performance impediments related to the integration.

4.	How to Lie and Confuse with Visualization

People have lied with statistics and maps for
years.  Now it's time to look into lying and confusing
in the field of visualization.  Your once-a-year big
chance to do just that, in the open, will be in this
special session on Tuesday, October 26, 1993 at 7:00
pm.  You are invited to bring with you visualization
lies and confusing articles, yours or others, on 35
mm slides or video.  During this evening, it will be
allowed to lie but not to borrow credit, so please do
not forget to mention the producers' names.  After
the informal presentations and truthful debates, the
audience will choose the biggest (visualization) lie
for 1993.  When the evening is over, lying will be
outlawed again.  Then, we will be all able to benefit
from this teaching of what it takes to produce
realistic and faithful visualizations.

    Reservations and advance submissions are now
being accepted (c/o Nahum Gershon, The MITRE
Corporation, 7525 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA
22102).  Both are not required but are strongly
recommended.  For more information    (genuine!),
