                            CALL FOR PAPERS


                           THIRD WORKSHOP ON

                 THEOREM PROVING WITH ANALYTIC TABLEAUX

                          AND RELATED METHODS


               Abingdon, near Oxford, U.K., May 4-6, 1994

This workshop is a continuation of workshops on the same topic
held in Lautenbach near Karlsruhe (1992) and Marseille (1993).
Each had a wide international participation.

Topics of Interest
------------------
Given the increased interest in tableau-based theorem proving,
this workshop intends to bring together researchers interested
in the mechanisation of reasoning with tableaux and related
systems. Included (but not exclusively) will be:

       - analytic tableaux           - model elimination
       - connection method           - sequent calculi

The workshop has a dual focus, bringing together:

    - people who develop tableau-like calculi for classical
      and non-classical logics;
    - people who are involved in the practical implementation of
      tableau-like calculi.

Hence, the focus will be on both theoretical work and the
presentation of implementation techniques and related practical
experience.

Submission of Papers
--------------------
Authors are invited to submit four copies of a short paper (at
most seven pages) or four copies of a long paper (at most 15
pages) in English before
                        ---------------------
                         November 22th, 1993
                        ---------------------

to Marcello D'Agostino. The papers will be refereed by the programme
committee and all accepted papers will be printed
in a technical report.

Publication of the Contributions
--------------------------------
Accepted papers will be considered for publication in a special
volume intended for the Oxford University Press series
Studies in Logic and Computation (subject to approval by the
publishing house). Selected papers will be recommended for
publication in the Journal of Logic and Computation,
subject to further (quick) reviewing.

Further Information
-------------------
The conference language is English and presentation will not
exceed 30 minutes. Each talk will be followed by a discussion
of 10 minutes. The workshop is planned for at most 40 talks.
Notification of acceptance will be sent by the middle of
February 1994. Contact Steve Reeves for details.

The workshop registration fee will be 90.00 pounds.
