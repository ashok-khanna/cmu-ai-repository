		   Call for workshop participation:


			  Automated Reasoning
	     Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice


			  April 11-12, 1994
		      University of Leeds, England


		      Held as part of the first
	       AISB Biennial Workshop and Tutorial Series
			 and co-sponsored by
    University of Leeds Centre for Theoretical Computer Science and
	     University of York Intelligent Systems Group


This workshop will provide an opportunity for the automated reasoning
community to meet in an informal setting to discuss recent work, new
ideas, and current trends in the field of automated reasoning.  It will
also provide an opportunity to get an overview of the many specialised
areas in which automated reasoning is progressing.

The scope of the workshop will cover the full breadth and diversity of
automated reasoning, including topics such as logic and functional
programming; equational reasoning; deductive databases; unification and
constraint solving; formal methods for specifying, deriving,
transforming and verifying software systems, hardware systems, and
system requirements; deductive and non-deductive reasoning, including
abduction, induction, nonmonotonic reasoning, and analogical reasoning;
commonsense reasoning; and the wide range of topics that fall under the
heading of knowledge representation and reasoning.

A large part of the workshop will be devoted to open discussion sessions
organised around specific topics related to the theme of the workshop,
"bridging the gap between theory and practice."  In addition to ample
discussion sessions, there will be open poster sessions, giving all
participants the opportunity to present their work.

This is intended to be an inclusive workshop, with participants
encouraged from the broad spectrum covered by the field of automated
reasoning.  We encourage the participation of experienced researchers as
well as those new to the field, especially students.

Required Background: Some understanding of the pure or applied problems
in any subarea of automated reasoning.

Submission Requirements: Anyone interested in participating in this
workshop should submit a position paper by February 16, 1994, to the
programme chair at the address below.  The paper should address the
theme of the workshop, "bridging the gap between theory and practice,"
as it applies to any aspect of automated reasoning.  As an example, one
could address the design of logic programming systems that are practical
for programming yet are close to being pure deductive systems.
Submissions must be a maximum of 2 pages of A4 paper with one inch
margins.  Authors either may submit three unstapled hardcopies of their
paper, or may email their paper in postscript.

On the basis of these submissions, invitations to the workshop will be
issued by March 3, 1994.  The position papers of all participants will
be assembled into an informal proceedings distributed to all
participants.  Participants wishing to revise their position papers, may
do so by March 15, 1994.

Funds are available to defray the expenses of full-time students who
attend the workshop.  If you are interested in obtaining such funding,
include with your submission a separate page containing a short case
for support that includes:
   - a statement that you are a full-time student, giving the name of your
     department and institution, and the degree that you are working on,
   - an estimated budget for attending the workshop, and
   - a list of all funds, with their sources, that you expect to have
     available for workshop expenses.

=======================================================================

The AISB Workshop and Tutorial Series comprises several workshops and
tutorials, thus providing an opportunity for attendees of one event to
meet with those from events during breaks and in the evenings. In some
instances, it is also possible for to attend more than one event.  In
particular, the schedule was designed to permit participation in the
Automated Reasoning Workshop on April 11-12 and the one-day Spatial and
Spatio-temporal Reasoning Workshop on April 13.  Further information on
the Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Reasoning Workshop can be obtained from
John Gooday (gooday@scs.leeds.ac.uk).

The other workshops and tutorials in the series are:

  Workshops
    Evolutionary Computing
    Models or Behaviours -- which  way forward for robotics?
    Computational Linguistics for Speech and Handwriting Recognition
    Spatial and Spatio-temporal Reasoning
    Computational Models of Cognition and Cognitive Functions
    Postgraduate Workshop

  Tutorials
    Practical Introduction to the Soar Cognitive Architecture
    Computing and Cognition as  Information Compression
