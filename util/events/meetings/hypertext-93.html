TECHNICAL PROGRAM
The technical program begins with a reception honoring Ted Nelson, the
father of hypertext. At the end of the reception, he will offer his views
on the future of the field.

The technical program includes three days of papers, panels, posters,
demonstrations, technical briefings, and videos. Papers present advances in
theory, implementations, or experience with hypertext. Technical briefings
offer in-depth analyses and demonstrations of hypertext systems or
applications. Panels provide a forum for exploring the art and business of
hypertext.

The video program will be available in hotel guest rooms and run
continuosly in a video theatre. Everyone is welcome to bring videos of
their own to show in the video theatre. Demonstrations of recent advances
or prototype systems enable conference participants to view systems in
action, as well as discuss the systems with the people who created them.
Posters promote in-depth interaction between presenters and participants.
This format also provides an opportunity for the exploration and discussion
of late-breaking developments, work-in-progress, and emerging concepts.
