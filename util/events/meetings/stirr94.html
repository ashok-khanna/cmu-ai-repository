 	            CALL FOR PAPERS

			Workshop
                           on

		Spatial and Temporal Interaction:
		 Representation and Reasoning

Singapore (prior to ICARCV'94), November 8, 1994

AIMS

The representational issues of spatial and temporal knowledge
are fundamental to several disciplines, such as Intelligent Systems,
Planning, Natural Language Understanding, Intelligent Process Control,
and  Discrete Simulation.  Each discipline uses its own specific
methods to model time and space.  Further, there are diverse ways in
which spatio-temporal reasoning is applied in different application
domains.  This workshop seeks to bring together researchers from
different fields to exchange and share ideas on this subject.

This one day workshop will be organised in Singapore in conjunction
with the International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Computer
Vision on 8th of November 1994.  The format of the workshop will be
a single track session where participants will present their work and
have time to discuss and summarise the presented work.  It is the aim
of the workshop to provide a forum for formal presentation and
informal discussions.  The number of participants will be limited to
around 30 to allow for meaningful discussions.

TOPICS

Submissions are invited in the following areas ( not an exclusive list):
	Spatial and Temporal Representation in
			Vision and AI
			Intelligent Systems
			Intelligent Control
			Planning
 	Learning Spatial /Temporal concepts
	Spatial/temporal reasoning
	Inexact reasoning
	Diagrammatic reasoning

DUE DATES

Papers due 			1st July 1994
Notification of acceptance	1st August 1994
Final Camera ready papers	9th September 1994

FORMAT

Authors are invited to submit three copies of their paper.
The length of the paper should not exceed 20 (double spaced)
pages including diagrams and tables.  Papers can be 
addressed to

The proceedings of the workshop will be published, and distributed to the
participants at the workshop. Authors of selected papers may be invited to
submit a paper to a special issue of an archival journal related to the
topic of spatial reasoning.

Any questions regarding the technical content of the workshop should be
directed to either of the co-chairs.
