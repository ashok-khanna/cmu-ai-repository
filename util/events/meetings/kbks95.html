        Second International Conference on Building and Sharing of
                   Very Large-Scale Knowledge Bases

                          April 10-13, 1995

                        University of Twente

                  FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS


Following the success of KB&KS'93, the First International Conference
on Building and Sharing of Very Large-Scale Knowledge Bases, in Tokyo,
Japan, a second conference with the same charter will be held at the
much acclaimed campus of the University of Twente, Enschede, the
Netherlands.

This is a first announcement. The electronic version of the general
information brochure will be updated regularly. See below, under
"Further information", for ways to access the information.


                          CALL FOR PAPERS

Like the first conference, the Second International Conference on
Building and Sharing of Very Large-Scale Knowledge Bases solicits
papers relevant to the subject. Papers reporting experimental work are
particularly invited. The charter of the conference is exemplified by:

- Knowledge representation systems for large knowledge bases
  o Computational complexity (both theoretical and empirical) in
    relation to scaling
  o Standardisation; sharing and reuse

- Contents of large knowledge bases
  o Knowledge acquisition for large knowledge bases
  o Reuse of resources
  o Standardisation; sharing and reuse; ontologies

- Applications of large knowledge bases, with particular emphasis on
  scientific and engineering applications. There will be a special
  track on large knowledge bases for materials science.

Authors are invited to submit a paper as either a flat ASCII file or a
self-contained standard PostScript file by email to:

kbks95-papers@cs.utwente.nl

Upon acceptance, authors will be required to deliver their final paper
using a special LaTeX style file that will be made available in due
time. If you have difficulties in complying with these standards,
please notify the organisers (address can be found below, under
"Further information").

Timetable:
December 1, 1994 - Deadline for paper submissions
January 10, 1995 - Notification of acceptance/rejection to authors
March 1, 1995 - Deadline for final paper
April 10, 1995 - Start of conference
