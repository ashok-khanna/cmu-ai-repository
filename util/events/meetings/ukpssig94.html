                       Call for Papers

                    The 13th Workshop of the 
        UK Planning and Scheduling Special Interest Group 

               University of Strathclyde, Glasgow
                     4th and 5th of May 1994


We are pleased to invite contributions for the 13th UK Workshop on 
AI Planning Systems and  AI Scheduling Systems, to be held at The 
University of Strathclyde, May the 3d and 4th, 1994.

This workshop will be aimed at bringing together researchers
attacking different aspects of the planning problem and the
scheduling problem. In order to attend we ask that you submit a paper
reporting work in progress or completed work (approx 5000 words), or a 
statement of interest or views on a particular topic (approx 1000 words).

This workshop will differ from previous SIG meetings in that we intend to
run two concurrent sessions on the first day (the 4th of May), one 
devoted to AI planning, the other to AI scheduling.



Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Applications: Empirical studies of existing planning/scheduling 
systems; domain-specific techniques; heuristic techniques.

Architectures: Real-time support for planning/scheduling/control;
mixed-initiative planning and user interfaces.

Environmental and task models: Analyses of the dynamics of
environments, tasks, and domains with regard to different models of
planning and execution.

Formal Models: Reasoning about knowledge, action, and time; search
methods and analysis of algorithms; formal characterisation of
existing planners and schedulers.

Intelligent Agency: Resource-bounded reasoning; distributed problem
solving; integrating reaction and deliberation.

Learning: Learning in the context of planning and execution; learning
new plans and operators; learning in the context of scheduling and
schedule maintenance

Memory Based Approaches: Case-based planning/scheduling; plan and operator
learning and reuse; incremental planning.

Planning and Perception: Integration of planning and perceptual
systems.

Reactive Systems: Environmentally driven devices/behaviours; reactive
control; behaviours in the context of minimal representations; schedule
maintenance.

Robotics: Motion and path planning; planning and control; planning
and perception.

Constraint-based Planning/Scheduling and Control Techniques: 
Constraint/preference propagation  techniques, variable/value ordering 
heuristics, intelligent backtracking/TMS-based techniques, iterative repair 
heuristics, etc.

Coordination Issues in Decentralised/Distributed planning/scheduling:
coordination issues in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, system 
architecture issues, integration of strategic and tactical decision making.

Iterative Improvement Techniques for Combinatorial Optimisation: 
Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Neural Nets, etc
applied to scheduling and/or planning.

Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research: Comparative studies
and innovative applications combining AI and OR techniques,
applied to scheduling and/or planning


Submission Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Those interested in participating should submit three copies
of a paper (work in progress, completed work, or statement of interest)
to the workshop organiser (Patrick Prosser) by the 31st of January 1994. 
Papers can also be submitted via email to pat@cs.strath.ac.uk
Participants will be selected by the Programme Committee based on their 
submissions. Invitations to participate will be sent by the 1st of March 1994.

On a separate sheet of paper, please indicate what level of attendance you
would require (see below under "Attendance at Workshop"), in order that we
can make this available in advance, and say whether you are interested in
scheduling, planning, or both.

Submissions and inquiries should be sent to:

Workshop Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wednesday the 4th of May. The day will be devoted to paper presentations. 
We will start with a plenary session, followed by two parallel sessions,
one on planning, the other on scheduling. There will then be a break for
coffee, followed by further parallel sessions, then lunch. After lunch we 
will then have two further parallel sessions, punctuated with coffee. The 
day's presentations will then close with a plenary session where we will 
organise group discussions for the following day. The workshop dinner 
will be held on the Wednesday evening.

Thursday the 5th of May. Four parallel discussion groups (2 on
planning, 2 on scheduling), during the morning. After lunch each of the
groups will make a brief presentation of their findings. There will
then be a business meeting of the SIG, and a new chairperson will be
elected.


Workshop Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The workshop will be held on campus, in the Strathclyde Graduate Business
School 's conference facilities (the recently completed Cathedral Street 
Building). Accommodation is available in the adjacent Sir William Duncan 
Building (more details below). The campus is within walking distance of 
two main line railway stations (Queen Street and Central Station), and is 
within easy reach of Glasgow Airport.


Attendance at Workshop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 levels of attendance at the workshop. 

Level 1: Accommodation for 2 nights
         3d of May, bed and breakfast and evening meal
         4th of May, bed and breakfast, lunch, workshop dinner
         5th of May , lunch

Level 2: Accommodation for 1 night
         4th of May, bed and breakfast, lunch, workshop dinner
         5th of May, lunch

Level 3: 4th of May, lunch and workshop dinner
         5th of May, lunch

Accommodation is in the Sir William Duncan Building. The 72 rooms
within this building have recently been refurbished and redecorated
to a high standard. Rooms include en-suite bathroom with shower, tea
and coffee making facilities, colour tv, single bed, telephone. 
The Sir William Duncan Building is connected to the Cathedral Street
building via a covered bridge.
         
We expect that the cost of attending the workshop will be (at most):

 Level 1. 150 pounds including vat
 Level 2. 115 pounds including vat
 Level 3.  60 pounds including vat

These prices may be reduced when we clarify the situation with respect 
to vat, and any financial assistance that we might be granted.

It is expected that the 4 best papers from the workshop will be published in
a future issue of AISB Quarterly (the Newsletter of the Society for the Study
of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour).
