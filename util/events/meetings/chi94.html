CHI '94 Workshops

Workshops provide an opportunity for small groups of participants who
share a technical interest to meet for 1 to 2 days of dialogue on their
areas of common concern.  Workshops are different than paper sessions,
panels and posters, in that the focus of workshops is on group
discussion of topics rather than presentations of individuals' positions
with follow-up questions.  All workshops require pre-conference activity
by the participants.  CHI '94 offers 10 workshops covering a range of
research and applied topics.  These workshops will be held Sunday, April
24 and Monday, April 25.

Results of the workshop can be presented both during and after the
conference.  During the conference, it is possible to present results
and expand discussion by holding a Special Interest Group Meeting (see
information on SIGs in this program).  After the conference, each
organizer provides an article summarizing the workshop for publication
in the SIGCHI Bulletin.  Several SIGCHI workshops have further presented
their contents by publishing books and journal articles.

Participation in a Workshop: To ensure a small enough group for open
interchange, each workshop is limited to a maximum of 20 participants
including the organizers. Participants are chosen before the conference
on the basis of position papers sent to the workshop organizers. Unless
stated otherwise in the individual workshop descriptions below, the
position papers are 2-3 page statements on the workshop theme. All
position papers are due to all workshop organizers by February 18th,
1994. Submitters will be notified of their selection by March 4, 1994
and must confirm their participation by March 18, 1994.

Fees: The fees are $25 for a 1-day workshop, $40 for a 1.5-day workshop,
and $50 for a 2-day workshop.

Pattern Recognition in Human-Computer Interaction: A Viable Approach?

All day Sunday, April 24 and Monday, April 25

In 1991, a SIGCHI workshop entitled "Neural Networks and Pattern
Recognition in Human-Computer Interaction" was held, involving
researchers using novel techniques, such as machine learning and neural
networks, on human-computer interaction (HCI) problems. Three years on
it is still unclear whether such an approach is viable for realistic
applications.

This workshop will address this question, bringing together researchers
in pattern recognition and HCI researchers who are investigating
problems involving the analysis of traces of interaction (e.g.
evaluation, user modelling, error diagnosis). The emphasis of the
workshop will be active research:  Participants will attempt to apply
pattern recognition techniques to derive solutions to identified HCI
problems. Its aim is twofold: to initiate interdisciplinary research in
the area and to consider the scope of these methods.

This will be a two-day workshop, limited to 16
participants who will be involved either in pattern recognition
(statistical, inductive or neural) or in relevant HCI research, but not
necessarily both.

Position statements (2-3 pages) from pattern recognition researchers
should describe the technique, its strengths and limitations, and any
computer tools.  HCI researchers should identify their problem area and
the pattern recognition issues it raises.  Participants will begin
discussion and establish research "teams" prior to the workshop itself,
and applicants should be prepared to take part in this preliminary work.

A book based on the workshop activities is planned and participants will
be asked to submit papers for inclusion at a later date.
