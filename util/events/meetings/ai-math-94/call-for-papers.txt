                        APPROACH OF THE SYMPOSIUM

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics
is the third of a biennial series featuring applications of
mathematics in artificial intelligence as well as artificial
intelligence techniques and results in mathematics.  There has always
been a strong relationship between the two disciplines; however, the
contact between practitioners of each has been limited, partly by the
lack of a forum in which the relationship could grow and flourish.
This symposium represents a step towards improving contacts and
promoting cross-fertilization between the two areas.  The editorial
board of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence serves
as the permanent organizing committee for the series of Symposia.

                        SUBMISSION DEADLINES
