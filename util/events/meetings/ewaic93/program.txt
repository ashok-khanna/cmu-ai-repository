                     FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

   EAST-WEST AI CONFERENCE: from theory to practice - EWAIC'93

                Moscow, Russia, September 7-9, 1993

Organized by
      (S)AAI - (Soviet) Association for Artificial Intelligence
jointly with

                        General Information
                        ===================

The major aims of the  "East-West  Conference on  Artificial  Intel-
ligence :  From Theory to Practice"  are to provide  a forum for the
exchange of ideas  between Eastern and Western scientists  regarding
the current state-of-the-art of the field of Artificial Intelligence
and its applications.

The main goal of the conference is to identify and study the relation
between theory and practice.

You are cordially invited to participate in EWAIC'93.

The technical programme of EWAIC'93 will run from Tuesday 7th to
Thursday  9th (inclusive) and will include invited talks,
presentations, posters and demonstrations. Monday 6th is reserved for
