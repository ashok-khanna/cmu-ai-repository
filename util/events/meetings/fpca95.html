	    7th Annual SIGPLAN/SIGARCH/WG2.8 Conference on

	Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture 1995

		La Jolla, California, June 26-28, 1995

			CALL FOR PAPERS

The seventh conference on Functional Programming Languages and
Computer Architectures will cover the design and theory of functional
programming languages, their applications, and their implementations
on both parallel and sequential architectures. Topics include (but are
not limited to): language design, type theory, formal semantics;
compilation techniques for sequential and parallel machines,
compile-time analysis, optimisations, program transformations; partial
evaluation; programming methods; generalisations of the functional
programming paradigm for state, control, non-determinism, and
parallelism; special-purpose functional languages and architectures;
architectural and system support for storage management, for garbage
collection, and for input/output in functional languages.  Papers
accepted for the conference must contain material not presented
previously in any formal forum.

Authors are also encouraged to submit papers showing how
insights from functional programming can be applied to other areas in
computer science; for example, the description and transformation of
VLSI circuit specifications, the systematic derivation of systolic
and data-parallel architectures and algorithms, and so on.

Submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance,
correctness, and clarity.  Each paper should explain its contribution in
both general and technical terms, identifying what has been
accomplished, saying why it is significant, and comparing it with
previous work. Authors should make every effort to make the technical
content of their papers understandable to a broad audience.

Authors should submit 14 copies of a full paper (up to 10 pages,
typeset 10-point on 16-point spacing in two-column conference style
format, printed double-sided if possible).  In addition, each
submission should be accompanied by electronic mail to
fpca95@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk, with a single postal address and electronic
mail address for communication, and complete title, author and
affiliation information.  For uniformity of submissions, a LaTeX style
file is available by electronic mail request from
fpca95@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk.  The program chair will either reject or
arbitrarily truncate all excessively long papers.

Submissions must be received by December 31, 1994.  Authors of
accepted papers will be expected to sign a copyright release
form.
