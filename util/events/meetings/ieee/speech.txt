VENUE
 
The 1993 IEEE Workshop on Speech Coding for Telecommunications will 
be held at Hotel Le Chantecler in Sainte-Adele, Quebec, 
about 70 kilometers northwest of Montreal in the Laurentian Mountains.
Sainte-Adele is within an hour of driving time from Montreal, and 
approximately two and a half hours from Ottawa, the capital of Canada.  
The Workshop will be held at a time when the mountains will be clothed 
in splendid fall colors.  Outdoor recreational activities, besides fall 
foliage viewing, include water sports on the lake, tennis, golf, hiking, 
mountain biking, and horseback riding.  Indoor facilities available 
include fitness equipment, swimming and whirlpool, sauna, and courts for 
squash, racquetball, and badminton.
 

WORKSHOP REGISTRATION
 
Complete the Workshop registration form and return it to the Workshop
Registrar by mail or fax.  Authors who have already registered may
use the Workshop registration form to sign up for the pre-arranged bus 
service.  Your payment may be remitted by a cheque or money order in 
Canadian dollars, payable to 1993 IEEE Workshop on Speech Coding. You 
may pay by charging to a credit card (fax registrations must charge to 
credit cards); only VISA or MasterCard can be accepted. The registration 
fee covers Workshop attendance, social events, and one copy of the Workshop
Proceedings. Additional copies of the Proceedings may be purchased at the
registration desk for Cdn $40 each. Meals are covered separately by your
accommodation arrangement with the Hotel (see below). Persons accompanying
Workshop delegates and who are not attending the technical sessions of the
Workshop need only register with the Hotel; however, accompanying persons
are welcome to participate in the social functions organized for Workshop
delegates.

Registrations will be accepted on a first-come-first-served basis.
Registrations received on or before September 15, 1993 are eligible to pay
the advance registration fees, and registrations received after September
15, 1993 are required to pay the late registration fees. Any arrears due 
to a difference between your remittance and the applicable fees will have 
to be cleared when you check in at the registration desk. To prevent
overcrowding, the Organizing Committee reserves the right to limit
enrollment and will notify registrants of their registration status.
On-site registration is treated as late registration. Due to limited
enrollment, on-site registration will not be accepted without prior
approval from the Workshop Registrar.

The registration fees are refundable, minus a Cdn $30 cancellation charge,
provided a written request is received by the Workshop Registrar by
September 30, 1993. With written notice to the Registrar, a registration
may be transferred to another person without charge.


ACCOMMODATION

Workshop delegates are responsible for making their own reservations for
accommodation directly with the hotel. Complete the hotel registration form
and return it to Hotel Le Chantecler by mail or fax. September 13, 1993 
is the last date by which room availability is guaranteed for Workshop
delegates. The hotel daily rates cover three meals (supper, breakfast,
lunch) each day, but a tax of 11.28% will be added to the hotel bill.  On
the hotel reservation form, you may also sign up for the lunch served on
October 13 prior to the commencement of the Workshop.

Delegates are welcome to make reservations with Le Chantecler for earlier
arrival or later departure. Alternatively, you may wish to stay in a hotel
in Montreal before and/or after the Workshop. Greater Montreal with its 3
million population is renowned as the second largest French city in the
world (after Paris). It has so many things to offer that no short

TRAVEL INFORMATION
 
Flights from Canadian and U.S. locations arrive at Dorval Airport, 
and flights from elsewhere arrive at Mirabel Airport.  Mirabel 
Airport is located in between Montreal and Sainte-Adele.  Delegates 
may choose between driving to Le Chantecler themselves, taking a bus 
from downtown Montreal that has been pre-arranged by the Workshop 
Organizing Committee, and taking a taxi.
 
Driving Instructions
 
>From Montreal, Dorval, or Mirabel, it is necessary to get on Autoroute 15
(Autoroute des Laurentides) and head north (northwest geographically) to
reach Sainte-Ad=E8le. If you are renting a car, ask your rental agency for
directions and a map. Autoroute 15 skirts the eastern boundary of Mirabel
Airport. From Mirabel to Sainte-Ad=E8le, take Autoroute 15 in the direction
going away from Montreal. From Dorval Airport, head towards Mirabel Airport
and continue on Autoroute 15 to Sainte-Ad=E8le. One possible route from
Dorval is to take 520 east (northeast), then 13 north (northwest), then 640
east (northeast), and 15 north (northwest).

While you on Autoroute 15 north to Sainte-Adele, take Exit 67 and follow 
Route 117 north.  At the 4th traffic light, turn left on rue Morin.  At the 
top of the hill, turn right on rue Chantecler and continue on to Hotel Le 
Chantecler.  The Hotel is about 3 km from Exit 67.
 
Car Rental
 
Most multinational car rental companies also operate in Canada,
usually under the same name.  One notable exception is Tilden,
which is affiliated with National in the U.S., Europcar in Europe,
and Nippon Car Rental in Japan.  To reserve a car, we suggest that 
you call your one of the car rental multinationals or a travel agent 
in your home country.  
 
Pre-arranged Bus Service To/From Sainte-Adele
 
The Workshop Organizing Committee has arranged for bus service between
downtown Montreal and Sainte-Ad=E8le, with optional stops at the two 
airports on the return trip. Registrants wishing to use the bus service 
should indicate so on the Workshop registration form. The fare is Cdn $20
one way, prepaid with the registration. Registrants who have prepaid the 
bus fare are guaranteed seats on the bus. Those who have not prepaid may 
board the bus if seats are available; no additional bus service will be 
enlisted for non-prepaid passengers. The bus fare for non-prepaid 
passengers is Cdn $25 one way, payable upon boarding to a Workshop official.
 
The bus will leave from downtown Montreal for Sainte-Adele on October 13, 
at 11:00 a.m.  Passengers will be picked up at the Mansfield Street 
entrance (near the intersection of Mansfield Street and Rene-Levesque 
Boulevard West) of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.  On October 15, the bus 
will leave Sainte-Adele for the Queen Elizabeth Hotel at 4 p.m.  Passengers 
on the return trip wishing to disembark at Mirabel Airport or Dorval Airport 
should notify the driver before the bus departs Sainte-Adele. 
 
Bus Service Between the Airports and Montreal
 
Autocar Connaisseur operates scheduled bus service between three locations:
downtown Montreal, Dorval Airport, and Mirabel Airport. Boarding in
downtown for the airports is at the Mansfield Street entrance (near the
intersection of Mansfield and Rene Levesque) of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.
The Dorval-downtown service operates every 20 minutes during most hours of
the day and every 30 minutes in the early morning and late night hours; the
cost is Cdn $8.50 one way and $16 return. The Mirabel-downtown service 
operates hourly before 12:00 noon and every half hour after 12:00 noon; 
the cost is Cdn $13 one way and $20 return. The Dorval-Mirabel service 
operates hourly in the periods 9:20-11:20 and 20:20-23:20, and every half 
hour in the period 11:20-20:20. Delegates planning a tight itinerary are
strongly advised to call Autocar Connaisseur at (514) 934-1222 for the exact
bus schedule.

Taxi
 
Taxi service between Dorval and downtown Montreal is currently fixed by
regulations at Cdn $24.  The taxi fare is roughly Cdn $60 between Mirabel 
and downtown.  Between Mirabel and Sainte-Adele, the taxi fare is 
approximately Cdn $40.  You may choose to take a bus from Dorval or 
downtown to Mirabel (see bus information above) and then take a taxi to 
Sainte-Adele.
 
Required Documentation
 
It is the responsibility of the delegate to comply with all Canadian
border entry requirements.  Please ask your local travel agent or nearest 
Canadian Embassy or Consulate what travel documents you need to visit 
Canada.  You might also need to check with your local authorities concerning 
documents required for returning to your country of residence. 
 
Health Insurance
 
Visitors to Canada should have adequate medical insurance coverage!
Canadian government health plans do not cover non-residents visiting
Canada.  We strongly suggest that you obtain health insurance that 
covers you during your stay in Canada.
 
Currency
 
There are banks and money changers in the airports and downtown Montreal. 
However, we suggest that you carry some Canadian money with you prior to 
arrival in Canada.  American dollars are accepted for many transactions,
though an exchange rate premium may be incurred.  As for delegates holding 
a currency not widely circulated internationally, it would be prudent to 
obtain Canadian or U.S. dollars prior to departure for Canada.
