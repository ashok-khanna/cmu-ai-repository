[This appeared in my e-mail recently.  It's a bit outside my
field, and what's more, our budget this year gives me similar
chances of attending conferences in the Ukraine and in the
asteroid belt,  but I thought some of you might be interested.
Respond to the addresses herein, not to me, as you now have all 
the information that I do about the conference. -jc]
