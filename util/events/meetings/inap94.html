topic:   Symposium on Industrial Applications of Prolog


Dear Colleague,

The other day I received the Call for Papers for INAP'94 from
Mr Yagihashi of Ren Associates and I am very pleased to forward it to you.

I hope you find the conference and its focus interesting.

If you know some researcher or practitioner working with Prolog who may not be aware of INAP, I shall be very happy if you can make the Call for Papers also available to her/him.

With best regards

INAP Target Focus and Audience
------------------------------

Prolog is famous as the first very high level programming language and for
its unique potential as a specification, artificial intelligence and
general purpose programming language.

Due to the growing number and economic importance of industrial applications
of Prolog based systems there is increasing need for specialized information
exchange catering to a sophisticated and critical audience in order to
discuss achievements, trends, needs and problems of commercial users.

INAP is a forum to discuss results and potential of the application of Prolog
in products, production, management, services and software engineering,
together with requirements, tools, programming techniques and standards
necessary to satisfy technological and economic constraints.

Authors are invited to submit full manuscripts (max 8 pages A4) or extended
abstracts in English or Japanese on applications of Prolog and related
topics including but not limited to:

     * Prolog in products
     * Prolog in production
     * Prolog in services
     * Prolog as R&D tool
     * software engineering
     * programming techiques
     * programming paradigms
     * standardization
     * industrial requirements
