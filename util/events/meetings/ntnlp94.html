			   Call for Papers

	    North Texas Natural Language Processing Workshop

================================================================================

Motivation

	Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fast growing area of research
and development.  Both government and industry have high interest in NLP
systems, and there is a need for more research and progress in this area.

	A workshop in NLP is being organized at UT-Arlington with the
intent of bringing researchers together to share their recent results
with each other.  Participants from industry as well as academia are
invited to attend the workshop, and to participate in discussions.

	Research in NLP is timely because there is a convergence in
several areas such as high-performance computer technology, large data
storage systems, and new results in parsing and reasoning.  Recently,
several research sites have gained experience in building systems with
large knowledge bases for processing natural language.  Some of these
sites have participated in the TIPSTER program, and some in the Message
Understanding Conferences (MUC).  The availability of large ontologies
such as WordNet will undoubtably stimulate construction of even larger
linguistic knowledge bases.


Workshop Format

	Researchers are invited to submit an extended summary
(approximately 1000 words) of their papers to the workshop committee.
Abstracts should describe original results.  The intent is to accommodate
as many presentations as possible and to allow ample time for discussion.
Currently, the workshop is intended for one day; however, if there are a
large number of participants, the workshop will be extended to two days.
Participation is open to all interested individuals, and is not restricted
to researchers from North Texas.  Individuals who do not wish to submit
a paper for presentation are invited to attend the workshop and participate
in discussions.


Important Dates

	Extended summaries should be submitted to the workshop committee
no later than March 15, 1994.  Authors will be notified of paper acceptance
by April 11, 1994, and final copies of papers are due on May 10, 1994.
Papers must be submitted in hard copy to the address below, and will be
assembled into the proceedings, which will be available at the workshop.
Electronic versions of ASCII or Postscript submissions may also be sent to
ntnlp@centauri.uta.edu.

	The workshop will take place at the University of Texas at
Arlington on May 23.  Registration information will be sent to all
submitters and will be available upon request.


Cost

	The workshop fee is $50.00, and includes a copy of the
proceedings and refreshments.
