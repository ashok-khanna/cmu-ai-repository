(10 characters per inch for typewriters).  Each page must have a
maximum of 38 lines and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article style, 12 point).  Papers not
adhering to this format may be returned without review.  Double-sided
printing is strongly encouraged.  The title page of each paper must
include the e-mail and postal addresses of all authors, an abstract,
and one or more keywords from the following list to aid in the
reviewing process: analogy, Bayesian learning, case-based reasoning,
cognitive modeling, computational learning theory, concept formation,
decision trees, discovery, explanation-based learning, genetic
algorithms, inductive logic programming, instance-based learning,
knowledge acquisition, minimum description length, neural networks,
reformulation, reinforcement learning, scientific theory formation,
speedup learning, theory refinement, unsupervised learning,
constructive induction, multi-strategy learning.

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

The COLT and ML conferences will be held together this year at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick.  This is the first time that COLT and ML
will be held in the same location, and we are looking forward to a
lively and interdisciplinary meeting of the two communities.  Please
come and help make this exciting experiment a success.

Among the highlights of the conferences are three invited lectures,
and, on Sunday, July 10, a day of workshops and tutorials on a variety
of topics relevant to machine learning.  The tutorials are sponsored
by the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer
Science (DIMACS), and are free and open to the general public.  COLT
is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Algorithms and
Computation Theory (SIGACT) and on Artificial Intelligence (SIGART).
In addition, COLT and ML received generous support this year from AT&T
Bell Laboratories and the NEC Research Institute.

>>>> WARNING <<<<  The dates of the conferences coincide this year
with the World Cup soccer matches being held at Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, New Jersey.  These games are expected to be the largest
sporting event ever held in the New York metropolitan area, and it is
possible that the volume of soccer fans in the area could adversely
affect your ability to make travel reservations.  Therefore, IT IS
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU MAKE ALL YOUR TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS AS
EARLY AS POSSIBLE.


			 GENERAL INFORMATION

LOCATION.  The conferences will be held at the College Avenue Campus
of Rutgers University in downtown New Brunswick, which is easily
accessible by air, train, and car.  For air travel, New Brunswick is
35 minutes from Newark International Airport, a major U.S. and
international airline hub.  By rail, the New Brunswick train station
is located less than four blocks from the conference site and is on
Amtrak's Northeast corridor.  For travel by car, the conference site
is approximately three miles from Exit 9 of the New Jersey Turnpike.

See instructions below for obtaining a map of the campus.  Most
conference activities will take place in Scott Hall (#21 on map) and
Murray Hall (#22).  Conference check-in and on-site registration will
take place in Scott Hall (follow signs for exact room location) on
Saturday, July 9 at 3-6pm, and everyday after that beginning at 8am.

REGISTRATION.  Please complete the attached registration form, and
return it with a check or money order for the full amount.  The early
registration (postmark) deadline is May 27, 1994.

HOUSING.  We have established the group rate of $91/night for a single
or a double at the HYATT REGENCY HOTEL (about five blocks from the
conference site).  This rate is only guaranteed through June 10, 1994,
and, due to limited availability, it is strongly recommended that you
make reservations as soon as possible.  To reserve a room, please
contact the Hyatt directly and be sure to reference ML94/COLT94 (phone
908-873-1234 or 800-233-1234; fax 908-873-1382; or write Hyatt
Regency, 2 Albany Street, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA).  Parking is
available at the hotel for a discounted $3/night.

We have also reserved dormitory space in two dorms, both of which are
an easy walk to the main conference site.  Dorm reservations must be
made by the early registration deadline of May 27, 1994.  Both dorms
include daily maid service (linens provided first day for the week and
daily fresh towels and beds made).  The Stonier Hall dorms (#56 on
map) are air-conditioned with private bath and are situated in the
center of the campus.  Due to limited availability, only shared double
rooms are available in Stonier.  Only a block away, the Campbell Hall
dorms (#50) are one of a set of three "river dorms" overlooking the
Raritan River.  Although Campbell Hall is not air-conditioned, the
view of the river is quite pleasing and rooms on the river side should
offer good air flow.  Baths in Campbell are shared on each floor, with
single and double rooms available.

Please specify your dorm preference on your registration form, and we
will assign space accordingly on a first come, first served basis as
long as rooms are available.  Unfortunately, because there are only a
finite number of rooms within each dormitory, we cannot absolutely
guarantee your request.  Check-in for the dorms will take place at the
Housing Office in Clothier Hall (#35) which is located next to the
Hurtado Health Center (#37) on Bishop Place.  Check-in hours will be
4pm to midnight, July 9-13.

TRAVEL BY AIR.  Newark International Airport is by far the most
convenient.  A taxi from the airport to New Brunswick costs about $36
(plus nominal tolls) for up to four passengers.  (This is the
flat-rate fare for a _licensed_ taxi from the official-looking taxi
stand; it is strongly recommended that you refuse rides offered by
unlicensed taxi drivers who may approach you elsewhere in the
airport.)  Shuttle service to New Brunswick is available from ICS for
$23 per person.  ICS shuttles run direct to the Hyatt, and require at
least one-day advance reservations (908-566-0795 or 800-225-4427).  If
renting a car, follow signs out of the airport to New Jersey Turnpike
South, and continue with the directions below.  By public
transportation, take the Airlink bus ($4 exact fare) to Newark Penn
Station and follow the "by rail" directions below.  (New Jersey
Transit train fare is $5.25 one-way or $8 round trip excursion; trains
run about twice an hour during the week, and less often in the evening
and on weekends.)

TRAVEL BY CAR.  Take the New Jersey Turnpike (south from Newark or New
York, north from Philadelphia) to Exit 9.  Follow signs onto Route 18
North or West (labeled differently at different spots) toward New
Brunswick.  Take the Route 27, Princeton exit onto Albany Street
(Route 27) into downtown New Brunswick.  The Hyatt Regency Hotel will
be on your left after the first light.  If staying at the Hyatt, turn
left at the next light, Neilson Street, and left again into the front
entrance of the hotel.  If staying in the dorms, continue past this
light to the following light, George Street, and turn right.  Stay on
George Street to just before the fifth street and turn left into the
Parking Deck (#55 on map).  Walk to the Housing Office in Clothier
Hall (#35) for dormitory check-in.  Parking passes will be provided to
all conference registrants.

TRAVEL BY RAIL.  Take either an Amtrak or a New Jersey Transit train
to the New Brunswick train station.  This is located at the corner of
Albany Street and Easton Avenue.  If staying at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel, it is a (long) three block walk to the left on Albany Street to
the hotel.  If staying in the dorms it is a (long) six block walk to
the Housing Office in Clothier Hall (#35 on map) for dormitory
check-in.  (The taxi stand is in front of the train station on Albany
Street.)

MEALS.  Continental breakfast is included with registration, but not
lunch or dinner.  Restaurants abound within walking distance of the
conference and housing venue, ranging from inexpensive food geared to
college students to more expensive dining.

A reception on July 12 is scheduled at the rustic Log Cabin, situated
next to the experimental gardens of the agricultural campus, as part
of the registration package for all ML94 and COLT94 attendees.  The
banquet on July 13 is included in the registration package for
everyone except students.

CLIMATE.  New Jersey in July is typically hot, with average daily
highs around 85 degrees, and overnight lows around 70.  Most days in
July are sunny, but also come prepared for the possibility of
occasional rain.

THINGS TO DO.  The newly opened Liberty Science Center is a fun,
hands-on science museum located in Liberty State Park, about 30-45
minutes from New Brunswick (201-200-1000).  From Liberty State Park,
one can also take a ferry to the Statue of Liberty and the Immigration
Museum at Ellis Island.

New York City can be reached in under an hour by rail on New Jersey
Transit.  Trains run about twice an hour during the week, and once an
hour on weekends and at night.  Fare is $7.75 one-way, $11.50 round
trip excursion.

New Brunswick has a number of theaters, including the State Theater
(908-247-7200), the George Street Playhouse (908-246-7717), and the
Crossroads Theater (908-249-5560).

The New Jersey shore is less than an hour from New Brunswick.  Points
along the shore vary greatly in character.  Some, such as Point
Pleasant, have long boardwalks with amusement park rides, video
arcades, etc.  Others, such as Spring Lake, are quiet and
uncommercialized with clean and very pretty beaches.  Further south,
about two hours from New Brunswick, are the casinos of Atlantic City.

You can walk for miles and miles along the towpath of the peaceful
Delaware and Raritan Canal which runs from New Brunswick south past
Princeton.

Your registration packet will include a pass for access to the College
Avenue Gymnasium (near the dormitories, #77 on map).
