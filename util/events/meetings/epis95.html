                              CALL FOR PAPERS

                  Emerging Paradigms for Intelligent Systems

           HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES - 28

                           JANUARY 3 - 6, 1995

                               MAUI, HAWAII

Papers are invited for the minitrack on Emerging Paradigms for Intelligent 
Systems as part of the Information Systems track at the Hawaii International 
Conference on System Sciences  (HICSS).

Papers are invited on issues relating to the design and development of
integrated AI architectures based on emerging computational
technologies (distributed processing, object-oriented design,
concurrent processing, visualization techniques, standardized
interfaces, etc.). The goals of the track are to bring together
researchers actively involved in the design of intelligent systems
(and intelligent applications) as well as those involved in the
development of computational technologies that are viable models for
implementation of large intelligent systems. Issues of interest in
this track include the impact of using new computational paradigms for
the design of intelligent systems, as well as the amenability of
integrated approaches to intelligent architectures towards the
employment of new computational models.  Papers describing research as
well as position papers are invited in, but not restricted to, the
following topics (specifically {\em contributing towards the
identification of emerging paradigms for intelligent architectures}):

integrated AI architectures 
unified AI ontologies
integrating reasoning strategies
concurrent AI models
distributed AI models
hybrid KR systems
hybrid reasoning strategies
object-oriented AI design
concurrent object-oriented design

The purpose of HICSS is to provide a forum for the interchange of
ideas, research results, development activities, and applications
among academicians and practitioners in computer-based system
sciences.  The conference consists of tutorials, advanced seminars,
presentations of accepted papers, open forums, task forces, and
plenary and distinguished guest lectures.  There is a high degree of
interaction and discussion among the conference participants because
the conference is conducted in a workshop-like setting.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING PAPERS:

1. Submit 6 (six) copies of the full paper, consisting of 20-25 pages
    double-spaced including title page, abstract, references and diagrams
    directly to the minitrack coordinator.

2. Do not submit the paper to more than one minitrack.  Paper should
    contain original material and not be previously published or currently
    submitted for consideration elsewhere.

3. Each paper must have a title page which includes the title, full name of
    all authors, and their complete addresses including affliation(s),
    telephone numbers(s), and e-mail address(es).

4. The first page of the paper should include the title and a 300-word
    abstract.


DEADLINES:

MARCH 15, 1994: Abstracts may be submitted to minitrack coordinators (or
                 track coordinators) for guidance and indication of
                 appropriate content.  authors unfamiliar with HICSS or who
                 wish additional guidance are encouraged to contact any
                 coordinator to discuss potential papers.

JUNE 1, 1994:   Six (6) copies of the full papers must be submitted to the
                 approriate minitrack or track coordinator.

AUG. 31, 1994:  Notification of accepted papers mailed to authors.

OCT. 1, 1994:   Accepted manuscripts, camera-ready, sent to minitrack
                 coordinators.  One author from each paper must be registered
                 by this time.

NOV. 15, 1994:  All other registrations must be received.  Registration
                 received after this deadline may not be accepted due to
                 space limitations.  Hotel reservations should also be made
                 by this time.

Thee "Emerging Paradigms for Intelligent Systems" minitrack is part of
the Information Systems track.  There are three other major tracks in
the conference: Architecture, Software Technology and Biotechnology
Computing.  The Information Systems track itself has several
minitracks that focus on a variety of research topics in Collaboration
Technology, Decision Support and Knowledge-based Systems, and
Organizational Systems and Technology.  For more information contact:
