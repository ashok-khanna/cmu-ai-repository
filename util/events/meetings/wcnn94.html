	Attn: Program Chairs

INNS members will be allowed a chance for revision. In order to be elegible for
revision, your cover letter MUST include your INNS member number.
All members of INNS up to the paper deadline may designate up to one paper with
themselves as an author for automatic acceptance. This guarantees only a poster 
presentation and abstract publication  for that paper.
INNS members and others may submit papers already accepted by journals, or 
publicly accessible Tech reports. In lieu of a paper, for considerations as the
basis of an oral presentation. In such a case, the member must submit at least
three copies of the relevant paper, along with an abstract of the talk which
clearly cites the paper well enough to permit easy access to it. When such talk
are accepted, then only the abstracts will be published.

1. NEWS 
   From the Organizing Committee:
   The INNS Office has had a management change. We apologize for any delay, 
   confusion or inconvenience you may have experienced during transition.
   The Registration Deadline has been extended to MAY 16.
   Many of you know our new management from previous Congresses: 
   Talley Associates  (Att: Melissa Bishop)
   Address: 875 Kings Highway, Suite 200
   Woodbury, NJ 08096; Voice 609-845-1720; FAX 609-853-0411 
   You may use this FAX for Congress Registration.
   Details of the change will be presented Monday June 6, 5-6 pm during 
   the Presidential Speech. Your support is making WCNN'94 a success. 
         Signed: Paul Werbos, Bernard Widrow, Harold Szu
         
Should you have any specific recommendation about ways to make WCNN-94
more productive, please contact any Governors that you know or 
Dr. Harold Szu at (301) 390-3097; FAX (301) 390-3923; e-mail: 
hszu%ulysses@relay.nswc.navy.mil.  

To improve the structure of the Congress and achieve a more compact
schedule for attendees, several changes have been made since the
Preliminary Program:
A. Short Courses Start Sunday Morning June 5. 
   All Saturday Short Courses have been moved to Monday June 6, with the
   exception that Course [I] (J. Dayhoff) will be given Sunday 8AM - 12PM.
   To make room in the schedule for that change, Course [H] (W. Freeman) 
   moves from Sunday to Monday 8AM - 12PM.
   On Monday the Short Courses are concurrent with the Exposition.
B. The SPECIAL OFFER has been made more generous, to encourage students.  
   For each of your Short Course registrations you can give a colleague 
   in the same or lower-priced Registration  Category a FREE Short Course! 
   Enter his or her name on the Registration Form below ``TOTAL.'' 
   The recipient of the gift should indicate ``Gift from [your name]'' at  
   the time of registration. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PRE-REGISTERED,  arrange  
   the gift now by FAX to 609-853-0411.

1. NEWS!
   	WCNN'94 has accepted over 600 papers that are published in the
  Proceedings.  An interdisciplinary and scientific approach to neural
  network is maintained with a balanced program in all application areas
  as well. Furthermore, WCNN'94 has two days (Sunday & Monday June 5,6) 
  filled with 22 half-day short courses (never given before) by all INNS
  Governors who have participated this year.  Judging by these, WCNN'94
  will be indeed a very exciting conference.
    To ease the on-site registration congestion, the official deadline 
  for WCNN'94 pre-registration has been postponed to
                       May 16, 1994. 
  PostDocs may obtain the Student Rate by including a letter from your
  Supervisor with the  Registration Form (or bring it to the Congress
  for a refund).
  FAX the Form (item 9) or email your questions to:

   Talley Associates  (Att: WCNN'94 Melissa Bishop)
   Address: 875 Kings Highway, Suite 200
   Woodbury, NJ 08096; Voice 609-845-1720; FAX 609-853-0411,
   e-mail: 74577.504@compuserve.com 
   
   SUBMIT YOUR NOVEL RESULTS UNTIL JUNE 1 FOR ON-SITE PUBLICATION
   In order to stimulate rapid growth in neural network research, we 
   encourage the presentation of your newest results in the Congress. 
   The deadline for Proceedings has passed, but in answer to many 
   requests here is good news:

You may submit one original and three copies in the standard format to
our Talley conference management (to be reviewed by the three members of
Organization Committee) for rapid separate publication at the Congress. 
                  The deadline is June 1, 1994.  
Notification will be made by fax, phone, or e-mail a few days after 
receipt of your paper. If accepted, your registration will be 
handled specially to enjoy the saving of pre-registration. If there are 
a sufficient number of these Novel papers accepted, there will be a special 
session created called "Novel Results" during the Congress. Otherwise, a 
poster presentation will be guaranteed.

  Moreover, in order to promote the WCNN'94 education program, you can
give a short course to one of your friends free of charge, if you pay for 
one tuition. If you sign up for two courses, you will get one extra
free, and this bonus is likewise extended to your chosen friend as well.
  	Finally, we mentioned that we have streamlined WCNN'94 meeting
management by giving Talley direct control over the management of the
Conference, without going through the Executive Office.  Many of you know 
the Talley management team from previous Congresses. You may use their
FAX (609-853-0411) for registration; use the form at the end of this message. 
   
   Signed: Paul Werbos, Bernard Widrow, Harold Szu
         
P.S. Should you have any specific recommendation about ways to make WCNN'94
more successful, please contact any Governors that you know, or 
Dr. Harold Szu at (301) 390-3097; FAX (301) 390-3923; e-mail: 
hszu%ulysses@relay.nswc.navy.mil.  
                              ***
To improve the structure of the Congress and achieve a more compact
schedule for attendees, several changes have been made since the
Preliminary Program:
A. Short Courses Start Sunday Morning June 5. 
   All Saturday Short Courses have been moved to Monday June 6, with the
   exception that Course [I] (J. Dayhoff) will be given Sunday 8AM - 12PM.
   To make room in the schedule for that change, Course [H] (W. Freeman) 
   moves from Sunday to Monday 8AM - 12PM.  On Monday the Short Courses are 
   concurrent with the Exposition.  [To Lecturers: Talley will reproduce 
   Course Notes received by no later than May 20.]
B. The SPECIAL OFFER has been made more generous, to encourage students.  
   For each of your Short Course registrations you can give a colleague 
   in the same or lower-priced Registration  Category a FREE Short Course! 
   Enter his or her name on the Registration Form below ``TOTAL.'' 
   The recipient of the gift should indicate ``Gift from [your name]'' at  
   the time of registration. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PRE-REGISTERED,  arrange  
   the gift now by FAX to 609-853-0411.
