                     KR'94 - 2nd CALL FOR PAPERS 

                  FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                            PRINCIPLES OF
                KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING
                                   
              Gustav Stresemann Institut, Bonn, Germany
                           May 24-27, 1994
               with support from GI, ECCAI, and CSCSI
                in cooperation with AAAI and IJCAII

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: November 8, 1993


Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by inference
algorithms provide an important foundation for much work in Artificial
Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems, and a growing
number of researchers study the principles governing systems based on
such representations and reasoning.  The KR conferences bring together
these researchers in a more intimate setting than that of general AI
conferences, and provide authors with the opportunity to give
presentations of adequate length to present substantial results.
This year's conference will take place in Europe for the first time.

The conference emphasizes both the theoretical principles of knowledge
representation and reasoning and the relationships between these
principles and their embodiments in working systems.  Authors are
encouraged to relate their work to at least one of the following
questions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real
    problems, and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation
    and reasoning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge
    representation systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding
    approaches in other parts of AI (natural language, robotics, etc.)
    or in other fields (psychology, philosophy, logic, economics,
    cognitive science, computer science, management, engineering, etc.)  

Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:

REPRESENTATIONAL FORMALISMS            REASONING METHODS AND TASKS
- logics of knowledge and belief       - deduction

                         SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The Program Committee will review EXTENDED ABSTRACTS rather than
complete papers.  Abstracts must be at most twelve (12) pages with a
maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article-style, 12pt), excluding the title
page and the bibliography.  Overlength submissions will be rejected
without review.  All abstracts must be submitted on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4
paper, and printed or typed in 12-point font (10 characters/inch on a
typewriter).  Dot matrix printout, FAX, or electronic submission will
not be accepted.  Each submission should include the names and
complete addresses (including email, when possible) of all authors.
Correspondence will be sent to the first author, unless otherwise
indicated.  Also, authors should indicate under the title which of the
questions and/or topic areas listed above best describes their paper
(if none is appropriate, please give a set of keywords that best
describe the topic of the paper).  To be considered, five (5) paper
copies of the extended abstract must be received by one of the program
co-chairs no later than November 8, 1993 (or must have been sent by
express courier no later than November 5).  Authors are also
STRONGLY encouraged (it is to their advantage) to submit an electronic
abstract in the form described below.  Electronic abstracts that
accurately reflect the contents of the papers will significantly aid
the reviewing process by helping direct the papers to the most
appropriate reviewers.

                         MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must be unpublished and substantively different from
papers currently under review.  Papers may be submitted after January
1, 1994 to other conferences as long as (a) the prior submission to
KR'94 is noted on those submissions and (b) the paper is withdrawn
from the later conference if accepted by KR'94.

                         ELECTRONIC ABSTRACT

In addition to submitting the paper copies of the extended abstract,
authors should (if possible) send a short (200 word) electronic
abstract of their paper to KR94-abstracts@medg.lcs.mit.edu to aid in
the reviewing process.  In order to make use of software for
classifying papers and selecting reviewers, most of the electronic
abstract must be in plain ASCII text (no LaTeX or other formatting
commands) in the following format, separating each field from the next
with a blank line.

TITLE: <title of paper>

FIRST AUTHOR: <last name, first name>

FIRST ADDRESS: <first author address or affiliation>

COAUTHORS: <their names, if any>

OTHER ADDRESSES: <addresses or affiliations of coauthors>

CONTENT AREAS: <at most three content areas, separated by commas>

KEYWORDS: <keywords, separated by commas>

ABSTRACT: <text of the abstract>

The content areas preferably should be drawn from the topics listed
above, with other areas added only if necessary.  The keywords are to
aid the human reviewers only and may be chosen as desired.  The text
of the abstract field may include formatting commands, if desired, but
these should be omitted from all other fields.  A blank form for
electronic abstracts and an example abstract may be found at the end
of this Call.

                           REVIEW OF PAPERS

Submissions will be judged on clarity, significance, and originality.
An important criterion for acceptance is that the paper clearly
contributes to principles of representation and reasoning that are
likely to influence current and future AI practice.  Extended
abstracts should contain enough information to enable the Program
Committee to identify and evaluate the principal contribution of the
research and its importance.  It should also be clear from the
extended abstract how the work compares to related work in the field.

                             NOTIFICATION

Authors will be notified of the Program Committee's decision by
January 24, 1994.  Notification will be made by electronic mail
whenever possible.

                             FINAL PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers will be expected to submit substantially
longer full papers for the conference proceedings.  Final camera-ready
copies of the full papers will be due February 28, 1994.  Final papers
will be allowed at most twelve (12) double-column pages in the
conference proceedings (corresponding to approximately 28
article-style LaTeX pages; a style file will be provided by the
publisher).

                          PLANNING TO ATTEND

People planning to attend the conference are asked to send a note
stating their intention as early as possible to the local conference
organizer, Ms. Christine Harms (Christine.Harms@gmd.de), in order to
help estimate the facilities needed for the conference.  (Postal

TITLE: Begriffsschrift: A formula language, modeled upon that of
arithmetic, for pure thought 

FIRST AUTHOR: Frege, Gottlob

FIRST ADDRESS: Department of Mathematics, University of Jena, Germany

CONTENT AREAS: logics, deduction

KEYWORDS: ideography, conceptual content, inferential sequence,
argument, function

ABSTRACT: I present an ideography to provide the most reliable test of
the validity of a chain of inferences, one that points out every
presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed, so that its origin
can be investigated.  I am confident that my ideography can be
successfully used wherever special value must be placed on the
validity of proofs, as for example when the foundations of the
differential and integral calculus are established.
