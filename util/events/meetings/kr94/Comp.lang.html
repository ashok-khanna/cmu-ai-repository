                     KR'94 - 2nd CALL FOR PAPERS 

                  FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                            PRINCIPLES OF
                KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING
                                   
              Gustav Stresemann Institut, Bonn, Germany
                           May 24-27, 1994
               with support from GI, ECCAI, and CSCSI
                in cooperation with AAAI and IJCAII

SUBMISSION DEADLINE: November 8, 1993


Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by inference
algorithms provide an important foundation for much work in Artificial
Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems, and a growing
number of researchers study the principles governing systems based on
such representations and reasoning.  The KR conferences bring together
these researchers in a more intimate setting than that of general AI
conferences, and provide authors with the opportunity to give
presentations of adequate length to present substantial results.
This year's conference will take place in Europe for the first time.

The conference emphasizes both the theoretical principles of knowledge
representation and reasoning and the relationships between these
principles and their embodiments in working systems.  Authors are
encouraged to relate their work to at least one of the following
questions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real
    problems, and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation
    and reasoning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge
    representation systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding
    approaches in other parts of AI (natural language, robotics, etc.)
    or in other fields (psychology, philosophy, logic, economics,
    cognitive science, computer science, management, engineering, etc.)  

Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:

                         SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The Program Committee will review EXTENDED ABSTRACTS rather than
complete papers.  Abstracts must be at most twelve (12) pages with a
maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article-style, 12pt), excluding the title
page and the bibliography.  Overlength submissions will be rejected
without review.  All abstracts must be submitted on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4
paper, and printed or typed in 12-point font (10 characters/inch on a
typewriter).  Dot matrix printout, FAX, or electronic submission will
not be accepted.  Each submission should include the names and
complete addresses (including email, when possible) of all authors.
Correspondence will be sent to the first author, unless otherwise
indicated.  Also, authors should indicate under the title which of the
questions and/or topic areas listed above best describes their paper
(if none is appropriate, please give a set of keywords that best
describe the topic of the paper).  To be considered, five (5) paper
copies of the extended abstract must be received by one of the program
co-chairs no later than November 8, 1993 (or must have been sent by
express courier no later than November 5).  Authors are also
STRONGLY encouraged (it is to their advantage) to submit an electronic
abstract in the form described below.  Electronic abstracts that
accurately reflect the contents of the papers will significantly aid
the reviewing process by helping direct the papers to the most
appropriate reviewers.

                         MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must be unpublished and substantively different from
papers currently under review.  Papers may be submitted after January
1, 1994 to other conferences as long as (a) the prior submission to
KR'94 is noted on those submissions and (b) the paper is withdrawn
from the later conference if accepted by KR'94.

                         ELECTRONIC ABSTRACT

In addition to submitting the paper copies of the extended abstract,
authors should (if possible) send a short (200 word) electronic
abstract of their paper to KR94-abstracts@medg.lcs.mit.edu to aid in
the reviewing process.  In order to make use of software for
classifying papers and selecting reviewers, most of the electronic
abstract must be in plain ASCII text (no LaTeX or other formatting
commands) in the following format, separating each field from the next
with a blank line.

TITLE: <title of paper>

FIRST AUTHOR: <last name, first name>

FIRST ADDRESS: <first author address or affiliation>

COAUTHORS: <their names, if any>

OTHER ADDRESSES: <addresses or affiliations of coauthors>

CONTENT AREAS: <at most three content areas, separated by commas>

KEYWORDS: <keywords, separated by commas>

ABSTRACT: <text of the abstract>

The content areas preferably should be drawn from the topics listed
above, with other areas added only if necessary.  The keywords are to
aid the human reviewers only and may be chosen as desired.  The text
of the abstract field may include formatting commands, if desired, but
these should be omitted from all other fields.  A blank form for
electronic abstracts and an example abstract may be found at the end
of this Call.

                           REVIEW OF PAPERS

Submissions will be judged on clarity, significance, and originality.
An important criterion for acceptance is that the paper clearly
contributes to principles of representation and reasoning that are
likely to influence current and future AI practice.  Extended
abstracts should contain enough information to enable the Program
Committee to identify and evaluate the principal contribution of the
research and its importance.  It should also be clear from the
extended abstract how the work compares to related work in the field.

                             NOTIFICATION

Authors will be notified of the Program Committee's decision by
January 24, 1994.  Notification will be made by electronic mail
whenever possible.

                             FINAL PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers will be expected to submit substantially
longer full papers for the conference proceedings.  Final camera-ready
copies of the full papers will be due February 28, 1994.  Final papers
will be allowed at most twelve (12) double-column pages in the
conference proceedings (corresponding to approximately 28
article-style LaTeX pages; a style file will be provided by the
publisher).

                          PLANNING TO ATTEND

People planning to attend the conference are asked to send a note
stating their intention as early as possible to the local conference
organizer, Ms. Christine Harms (Christine.Harms@gmd.de), in order to
help estimate the facilities needed for the conference.  (Postal

ABSTRACT: I present an ideography to provide the most reliable test of
the validity of a chain of inferences, one that points out every
presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed, so that its origin
can be investigated.  I am confident that my ideography can be
successfully used wherever special value must be placed on the
validity of proofs, as for example when the foundations of the
differential and integral calculus are established.

                                 ABOUT KR'94

KR'94, the first in its series to be held in Europe, provides a more  intimate
setting  than that of general AI conferences for researchers studying explicit
representations of knowledge manipulated by inference algorithms,  which  pro-
vide an important foundation for much work in Artificial Intelligence from na-
tural language to expert systems.

The  conference  emphasizes  both  the  theoretical  principles  of  knowledge
representation  and  reasoning  and the relationships between these principles
and their embodiments in working systems.  Presented  papers,  invited  talks,
panels,  and  audience  discussion  will address the following important ques-
tions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real problems,
    and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation  and  rea-
    soning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge  representa-
    tion systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding approaches  in
    other  parts  of  AI (natural language, robotics, etc.) or in other fields
    (psychology, philosophy, logic,  economics,  cognitive  science,  computer
    science, management, engineering, etc.)


                                  LOCATION

The KR'94 Conference will be held at the Gustav Stresemann Institut  (GSI)  in
Bonn,  Germany. The GSI is located just south of the downtown area within easy
reach of the main train station. Major airports are Cologne/Bonn (with regular
bus  service to downtown Bonn), Duesseldorf (1 hour by train) and Frankfurt (2
hours by train). Registered participants  will  receive  detailed  information
about the GSI and how to get there.

                               INVITED TALKS

Beyond Ignorance-Based Systems,
W. A. Woods --- Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Inc., USA

The field of artificial intelligence has a long tradition  of  exploiting  the
potential of limited domains.  While this is beneficial as a way to get start-
ed and has utility for applications of limited scope,  these  approaches  will
not  scale  to  systems  with  more  open-ended  domains  of  knowledge.  Many
"knowledge-based" systems actually derive their success as much from ignorance
as  from  the knowledge that they contain.  That is, they succeed because they
don't know any better.  Too great a reliance on a closed-world assumption  and
default reasoning in a limited domain can result in a system that is fundamen-
tally limited and cannot be extended beyond its initial domain.

If the field of knowledge-based systems is to move beyond this stage, we  need
to  develop  knowledge  representation  and  reasoning technology that is more
robust in the face of domain extensions. Nonmonotonic reasoning becomes a lia-
bility  if the fundamental abilities of a system can be destroyed by the addi-
tion of knowledge from a new domain.  This talk will discuss some of the chal-
lenges  that we must meet to develop systems that can handle diverse ranges of
knowledge.


Non Standard Theories of Uncertainty in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
Didier Dubois --- IRIT-CNRS Universite' Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France

The last 15 years have witnessed a noticeable but  scattered  research  effort
towards  a  rational  theory of plausible reasoning.  While Bayesian nets have
recently blossomed in this area, the role of logic  and  symbolic  representa-
tions  continue  to be prominent.  Besides, the monopoly of probability theory
as a tool for modelling uncertainty has been  challenged  by  alternative  ap-
proaches  such  as  belief  functions and possibility theory.  Current efforts
search for a knowledge representation framework that combines  the  merits  of
classical  logic and Bayesian probability.  The aim of this talk is to try and
provide a perspective view of uncertainty  theories  in  plausible  reasoning.
The lecture will touch on the following issues:

   - The use of ordering relations in uncertainty modelling and  its  link  to
     non-monotonic reasoning.
   - The problem of compositionality, and the difference between partial truth
     (as in fuzzy logic) and uncertainty.
   - Why Bayesian probabilities might be questioned in  reasoning  tasks  that
     are not decision-driven.
   - The importance of representing generic, exception-tolerant, knowledge  as
     distinct from uncertain evidence in plausible reasoning tasks.
   - The analysis of three forms of belief  change:  updating,  revision,  and
     focusing and their role in defeasible inference systems.


Knowledge Representation Issues in Integrated Planning and Learning Systems
Jaime Carbonell --- Carnegie Mellon University, USA

Advances in Machine Learning and in non-linear planning systems in  Artificial
Intelligence have proceeded somewhat independently of Knowledge Representation
issues.   In essence, both fields borrow from KR  the  very  essentials  (e.g.
typed  FOL,  or simple inheritance methods), and then proceed to address other
important issues.  However, the increasing sophistication of integrated archi-
tectures  such as SOAR. PRODIGY and THEO at CMU (that combine problem solving,
planning and learning) place new demands on their KR  infrastructures.   These
demands  include  reasoning  about  strategic  knowledge  as  well  as factual
knowledge, supporting representational shifts in domain knowledge,  and  meta-
reasoning  about  the  system's  own  reasoning  and  learning processes.  The
presentation will focus on the PRODIGY architecture and its needs and implica-
tions  for KR, especially when these may be in divergence with the primary ac-
tive topics in modern KR research.

        Regular DM 700
        Student DM 400
        Banquet DM  80 (optional)

The registration fee entitles participants to

  + attend all Invited Lectures, Technical Sessions, and Panels
  + receive all conference documentation including the conference proceedings
  + attend the reception on Monday
  + lunch and dinner during the time of the conference
  + morning and afternoon refreshments


                                  HOUSING

We reserved rooms at the Gustav Stresemann Institut  at  the  following  rates
(per night and per person, breakfast included):

       single room DM 95
       double room DM 75

Rooms will be allocated at a first-come first-served  basis.  We  reserve  the
right  to  change  a  reservation from double to single room if demand exceeds
supply.

To book a room, please fill in the room reservation section on  the  registra-
tion form and return it to the conference office.  Please note that rooms can-
not be occupied before 5 p.m. on Monday, May 23.  However, it is  possible  to
stay at the GSI over the weekend following the conference (Friday-Sunday).

Rooms need to be prepaid at the time of registration except for  extra  nights
following the conference.


                               SOCIAL EVENTS

On Monday evening, 5:00-10:00 p.m., a buffet style dinner will be  offered  to
set the stage for an informal get-together.

The banquet on Wednesday evening will be a knight's  meal  at  the  castle  of
Linz.   The  participants  will  be  taken to Linz by boat. The boat will sail
along the beautiful Rhine valley and also pass by the historically interesting
bridge  of  Remagen. This was the very last bridge destroyed by the Germans at
the end of World War II.
