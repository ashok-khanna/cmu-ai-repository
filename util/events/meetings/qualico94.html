TOPICS OF  INTEREST:  Papers  are  invited  on  substantial,
original, and  unpublished  research  on  all   aspects   of
Quantitative Linguistics, including, but not limited to, the
following.

1) Observations and descriptions of all aspects of  language
and text     phenomena,     including     the    areas    of
psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics,  linguistic   typology,
stylistics, etc.   as   far   as   they   use   quantitative
mathematical methods   (probability    theory,    stochastic
processes,  differential  and  difference  equations,  fuzzy
logics and set theory,  function theory etc.), on all levels
of linguistic analysis.

2) Applications   of   methods,  models,  or  findings  from
quantitative linguistics to  problems  of  natural  language
processing,  machine    translation,    language   teaching,
documentation and  information retrieval - especially in the
form of automated  systems  of  different  kinds  (automated
systems for scientific research,  expert systems, electronic
dictionaries, parsing systems, controlled large text corpora
etc.).

3) Methodological   problems  of   linguistic   measurement,
model construction, sampling and test theory.

4) Epistemological  issues  such  as explanation of language
and text phenomena, contributions  to  theory  construction,
systems theory, philosophy of science.


REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION: Papers should be either topical
papers (maximum six pages in final format)  or project notes
with demonstration  (maximum  four  pages),  preferably   in
English. Both should describe original work.The project note
should specify the computer platform that will be used. They
should emphasize  completed  work rather than intended work,
and they should indicate clearly the state of completion  of
the reported  results.  A paper accepted for presentation at
the QUALICO-94  Conference  cannot  be  presented at another
conference.

FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION:  Authors should submit four copies of
preliminary versions of their papers with  the  page  limits
above, on  A4  paper  with the title,  author(s),  addresses
(including e-mail if possible), affiliation across the  page
top, a short (five line) summary,  the words:  topical paper
or project note,  and a specification of the topic area.  As
well,  authors are strongly urged to email  the  title  page
information by the deadline date. Send the papers and emails
to the chairman of the program committee.
