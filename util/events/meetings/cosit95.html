        First Announcement and Call for Papers


                        C O S I T ' 9 5


        CONFERENCE ON SPATIAL INFORMATION THEORY
        
        Semmering near Vienna (Austria)
        
        September 21-23, 1995

CHAIRS

Andrew U. Frank (Technical University Vienna)
Werner Kuhn     (Technical University Vienna)
David M. Mark   (NCGIA, State University New York, Buffalo)


TOPIC AND TARGET GROUP

The second international conference on spatial information 
theory, COSIT'95, will concentrate on theoretical aspects of 
space and spatial information. It will deal with all aspects of 
"large scale" or "geographic" spaces and the description of 
objects, processes or events in them. Spatial information 
theory is the basis for the construction of Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), but also necessary for other 
uses of geographic information and useful for information 
system design in general. The use of GIS technology reveals a 
large number of interesting research questions which 
require an interdisciplinary approach for their solution. 
COSIT will bring together researchers from different 
disciplines, e.g.

*  Geography
*  Engineering
*  Geodesy
*  Computer Science
*  Cognitive Sciences
*  Environmental Psychology
*  Artificial Intelligence
*  Administration
*  History
*  Sociology

The conference organizers welcome all contributions on 
Spatial Information Theory. An idea of the conference's 
orientation can be gained from the proceedings of COSIT'93, 
published by Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer 
Science 716. The following topics are indicative for the field 
of interest and do not exclude other research areas:

*  Cognitive structure of space
*  Social and cultural organization of space
*  Languages of spatial relations
*  Structure of geographic information
*  Time in geographic information
*  Spatial and temporal reasoning
*  Quality aspects of geographic information
*  Treating incomplete or imprecise spatial data
*  Spatial data integration
*  Presentation of spatial information
*  Cartographic generalization
*  Computational geography
*  Spatial analysis and modeling
*  Simulation of processes in geographic space
*  User interface design
*  Design of generic elements for GIS interfaces
*  Metaphors for GIS
*  Virtual Reality
*  Cooperative work with spatial information
*  Administrative and legal processes in space


CONFERENCE PROGRAM

At the conference, results from recent research will be 
presented and discussions about advanced work in progress 
will take place. The conference program will be selected by 
an international, interdisciplinary program committee. 
Papers will be selected through a rigorous review of full 
paper contributions and the proceedings will be printed by a 
major publisher before the conference. Panels will discuss 
the relevance of research questions and compare possible 
approaches. Before the conference, Tutorials or Workshops 
introducing the topics of the conference will be organized, 
lasting from half a day to two days. Topical Meetings ("birds 
of a feather sessions") can be organized and proposals from 
convenors are welcome at any time before or during the 
conference.


SUBMISSIONS

Authors are requested to submit full papers, not abstracts, 
in English to the program chairs. The title page of the paper 
should contain the title, author(s), affiliation(s), the 
submitting author's mailing address, telephone number, fax 
number and e-mail address, as well as an abstract. The total 
length of a paper should be less than 18 pages double spaced 
(less than 6000 words), including figures and bibliography. 
The Program Committee will evaluate the papers based on 
scientific significance, relevance to the conference, novelty, 
relation to previously published literature, and clarity of 
presentation. If you are interested in holding a tutorial or 
workshop, please submit a brief proposal describing the 
topic, objective, and intended format as soon as possible.

A NOTE ON THE SITE

The small town of Semmering is a nice mountain resort, only 
an hour by train from Vienna on the main railway line to the 
south. It offers a calm and productive conference 
environment with great views, fresh air, and ample 
opportunities for outdoor activities. The conference will be 
held at a beautiful, recently remodeled classical hotel, 
offering accommodation for approximately $80 in a single 
and $55 in a double room (including a breakfast buffet). 
Some "Gasthaus" (pension) rooms at lower rates are 
available in the immediate neighborhood.
