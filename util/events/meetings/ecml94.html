               MLNET FAMILIARISATION WORKSHOP
                       Declarative Bias
                Catania, Italy,  april 9 1994

**********************************************************************

The  workshop  is to be  organized after   the European  Conference on
Machine  Learning (ECML 94),  april 6-8  1994,  in the context of  the
second MLNet familiarization workshop Catania, Italy.

**********************************************************************

		   Call for Contributions


Control of the learning process has always been a fundamental issue in
ML because it strongly affects the complexity  of the learning process
and the  learning  results.  There has  been lately  a strong interest
within the Machine   Learning community concerning  the elicitation of
this control   knowledge, referred to  as Declarative  Bias.  It grows
with   the development of real  world   applications that require more
adaptable  learning tools and  more  complex representation languages.
Representing control knowledge  in a declarative  way allows an expert
in ML or the ML system itself to easily shift it. 

Past    experiences with    ML  applications  have  demonstrated  that
cooperation with the user speeds up  the learning process by providing
explicit  control  information when  available.  Declarative   bias is
therefore a concise  and powerful   way for  the user to    explicitly
program the ML  system, instead of tuning  low level knowledge such as
examples and domain theory representation in order to improve learning
results. 

Three types of biases may be  characterised.  The first class a priori
restricts the  initial set  of candidate  definitions  for the  target
concept  (search  space), referred to   as language biases, the second
class sets heuristics to improve the search for the best definition(s)
through the search space.  The third class defines validation criteria
for learning.
 
It is obviously a difficult task for the  user to find the appropriate
combination of  biases to meet  her/his expectations.  Shifting biases
with respect to discrepancies observed between actual learning results
and expected ones  is   a promising  research issue.   Validation   of
results  and shift of bias  may be incrementally performed, after each
learning step by submitting intermediate results to the user or at the
end of the learning process.  This cyclic task  will be as easy as the
relationship  between biases and    her/his learning goals  are stated
clearly. 

Authors are encouraged   to submit  papers describing their   favorite
learning  system(s) in terms  of  elementary learning steps and biases
belonging to each of the three above classes.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS 


Authors should submit a paper or an extended abstract (not less than 2
pages)  fully  explaining  the   relevance  of   their work  to    the
workshop. Persons wishing to participate but who do not wish to give a
presentation   should submit  an abstract  (1   page) describing their
research and/or   interest in  the subject  area  and   their expected
contributions to the workshop.  Papers / abstracts  should be sent  in
five copies by  March 1 to:

ORGANISATION 

All attendees will  receive before the workshop  a list of  topics and
open   questions  that have emerged    from the  accepted  papers.  To
stimulate discussions, presentations are  strongly encouraged to refer
to these.  The worshop  will start  with  a panel presenting   the key
issues that will be    discussed during the sessions.    Schedule will
leave time for open discussions and syntheses.

                 ECML MLNet Workshop on
             Theory revision and restructuring

            Catania, Italy, April 9 or 10, 1994
                  Call for Contributions

  With the growing complexity of applications being tackled
by Machine  Learning,   it  has become  increasingly  clear
that besides  approaches  for  the  initial  acquisition of
knowledge bases we also need techniques for theory revision
and restructuring, i.e.,  techniques that  can use existing
learned or  human-supplied domain  theories and  can modify
them to improve their correctness, completeness, efficiency
or understandability.

  This  ECML  MLNet  workshop  intends  to  bring  together
the various approaches  to revision  and restructuring that
have been  developed  under  different  perspectives within
Machine Learning.     Traditionally,  revision  has  been a
part of incremental or hill-climbing learning systems which
keep only  one current  hypothesis  and modify  it whenever
new examples  arise.    More  recently,  revision  has been
identified has an  important part of  approaches that learn
multiple predicates  simultaneously,   and incorporated  as
a central component  of integrated  multi-strategy learning
systems.   Moreover,  revision  and restructuring  are also
important topics  in  several  neighboring  fields  such as
knowledge representation,  logic  programming  or deductive
databases.

  The  workshop invites  submissions on  all topics related
to theory  revision  and restructuring,  including  but not
limited to:

  o multiple-predicate learning
  o selection of preferred revisions, bias, constraints
  o revision as a part of multi-strategy learners
  o relationships  to neighboring  fields  (e.g.   revision
    work in knowledge representation and deductive database
    communities)
  o scientific theory revision
  o debugging techniques for revision
  o theory restructuring
  o applications of these techniques

Authors intending  to present  their  work should  submit a
two-page abstract of their talk until March 1st, 1994, to:

    Stefan Wrobel
    GMD, I3.KI, Schloss Birlinghoven
    53757 Sankt Augustin, Germany
    stefan.wrobel@gmd.de

preferably by E-Mail in LaTeX.  Authors will be notified of
acceptance until March  14,  1993.   A handout  of accepted
abstracts will be made available to participants.
