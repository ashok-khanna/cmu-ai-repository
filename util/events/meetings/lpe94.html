                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

             Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments
             ----- -------- -- ----- ----------- ------------

                           June 17 or 18, 1994
                     Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy

		  ( Held in conjunction with ICLP '94 )

Description:
-----------

  Logic programming environments have come a long way from the
original text-based paradigm.  Much work has been done on the creation
of better logic programming environments.  Furthermore, the characteristics
of logic programming languages often motivate innovative approaches
and techniques in the areas of user environments and programming tools.

  The Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments will provide
a forum for researchers and logic programming system developers to 
exchange ideas and results on all aspects of environments for logic 
programming.  This includes work related to design issues, new 
techniques and tools, and the solution of noteworthy problems arising, 
for example, from new  logic programming languages or interesting 
application areas.  Both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art 
presentations are welcome.  Specific topic areas relevant to the 
Workshop include, but are not be limited to:

 * user-interfaces and human engineering
 	e.g. support of program composition, execution control,
 	intelligent or enhanced debugging, embedded windowing 
 	and graphics capabilities

 * execution visualization
 	e.g. for program debugging, or performance analysis and tuning

 * software development tools
 	e.g. program composition aids, automatic transformation
 	or induction facilities, code partitioning and module schemes

 * provisions for new paradigms
	i.e. special characteristics or techniques for dealing with
	logic programming languages other than Prolog, such as parallel
	(LP) languages, constraint-based (LP) languages, languages 
	merging logical and functional paradigms, visual languages, etc.

 * interfacing to other language system tools
 	e.g. interfacing to partial evaluators, source-to-source transformers,
 	global analyzers, abstract interpreters in the underlying 
 	language system.

 * interfacing to external systems
 	e.g. foreign-language interfaces, data-base and file system interfaces,
 	interfaces to external windowing and graphics systems

  The workshop will be informal in nature, allowing ample time for
questions and discussions as well as presentations.  However, all presentations 
will be subject to a review process.  Registration for the workshop will be 
open to all  ICLP '94 attendees.  Duration of the workshop is dependent upon 
the level of participation received, but is expected to be one-half day.  A copy
of the proceedings will be made available to all participants.

  This workshop follows the successful 5th Workshop
on Logic Programming Environments, held in conjunction with ILPS '93.

Submissions:
-----------

  Submissions are invited for presentation during the Workshop.
All presentations will be subject to peer review.  The bulk of
presentations is expected to be research papers, though posters and
software demonstrations (either live or on video tape) are also welcome.

  Papers submitted for presentation are restricted to 6 pages in
length.  Authors are encouraged to write in the style of a "position paper",
and also identify whether state-of-the-practise or state-of-the-art work 
is being described.  

  Participants wishing to make poster presentations or give demonstrations
must submit an abstract describing the work.  A note should
also be included discussing any equipment or presentation needs.

  The following guidelines apply to either type of submission:

 * The title, author name(s) and address(es) (both postal and electronic),
   and date must be clearly given on the first page.

 * The actual submission must be in machine-readable
   form (either self-contained LaTeX source document or PostScript 
   file), and submitted electronically (e.g. by electronic mail).

 * Submissions should be sent to 
	iclp-wlpe@idt.unit.no .
   Authors may wish to compress and uuencode large PostScript files 
   before sending them to increase the probably of their safe and 
   timely delivery ("compress" and "uuencode" are the standard 
   UNIX facilities by those names).

 * Participants can expect confirmation within a day of submission
   that their paper or abstract has been received and is printable.
   Otherwise, they should send an electronic mail message describing
   the situation to
	nytroe@idt.unit.no .

  Final drafts will also be required in machine-readable form, with
electronic submission.

Dates:
-----
	First Call for Participation:			January 21, 1994
	Deadline for submissions:			March 28, 1994
	Notification of review results:			April 25, 1994
	Final Draft of Papers due:			May 23, 1994

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

             Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments
             ----- -------- -- ----- ----------- ------------

                           June 17 or 18, 1994
                     Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy

		  ( Held in conjunction with ICLP '94 )

Description:
-----------

  Logic programming environments have come a long way from the
original text-based paradigm.  Much work has been done on the creation
of better logic programming environments.  Furthermore, the characteristics
of logic programming languages often motivate innovative approaches
and techniques in the areas of user environments and programming tools.

  The Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments will provide
a forum for researchers and logic programming system developers to 
exchange ideas and results on all aspects of environments for logic 
programming.  This includes work related to design issues, new 
techniques and tools, and the solution of noteworthy problems arising, 
for example, from new  logic programming languages or interesting 
application areas.  Both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art 
presentations are welcome.  Specific topic areas relevant to the 
Workshop include, but are not be limited to:

 * user-interfaces and human engineering
 	e.g. support of program composition, execution control,
 	intelligent or enhanced debugging, embedded windowing 
 	and graphics capabilities

 * execution visualization
 	e.g. for program debugging, or performance analysis and tuning

 * software development tools
 	e.g. program composition aids, automatic transformation
 	or induction facilities, code partitioning and module schemes

 * provisions for new paradigms
	i.e. special characteristics or techniques for dealing with
	logic programming languages other than Prolog, such as parallel
	(LP) languages, constraint-based (LP) languages, languages 
	merging logical and functional paradigms, visual languages, etc.

 * interfacing to other language system tools
 	e.g. interfacing to partial evaluators, source-to-source transformers,
 	global analyzers, abstract interpreters in the underlying 
 	language system.

 * interfacing to external systems
 	e.g. foreign-language interfaces, data-base and file system interfaces,
 	interfaces to external windowing and graphics systems

  The workshop will be informal in nature, allowing ample time for
questions and discussions as well as presentations.  However, all presentations 
will be subject to a review process.  Registration for the workshop will be 
open to all  ICLP '94 attendees.  Duration of the workshop is dependent upon 
the level of participation received, but is expected to be one-half day.  A copy
of the proceedings will be made available to all participants.

  This workshop follows the successful 5th Workshop
on Logic Programming Environments, held in conjunction with ILPS '93.

Submissions:
-----------

  Submissions are invited for presentation during the Workshop.
All presentations will be subject to peer review.  The bulk of
presentations is expected to be research papers, though posters and
software demonstrations (either live or on video tape) are also welcome.

  Papers submitted for presentation are restricted to 6 pages in
length.  Authors are encouraged to write in the style of a "position paper",
and also identify whether state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art work 
is being described.  

  Participants wishing to make poster presentations or give demonstrations
must submit an abstract describing the work.  A note should
also be included discussing any equipment or presentation needs.

  The following guidelines apply to either type of submission:

 * The title, author name(s) and address(es) (both postal and electronic),
   and date must be clearly given on the first page.

 * The actual submission must be in machine-readable
   form (either self-contained LaTeX source document or PostScript 
   file), and submitted electronically (e.g. by electronic mail).

 * Submissions should be sent to 
	iclp-wlpe@idt.unit.no .
   Authors may wish to compress and uuencode large PostScript files 
   before sending them to increase the probably of their safe and 
   timely delivery ("compress" and "uuencode" are the standard 
   UNIX facilities by those names).

 * Participants can expect confirmation within a day of submission
   that their paper or abstract has been received and is printable.
   Otherwise, they should send an electronic mail message describing
   the situation to
	nytroe@idt.unit.no .

  Final drafts will also be required in machine-readable form, with
electronic submission.

Dates:

  The workshop will be informal in nature, allowing ample time for
questions and discussions as well as presentations.  However, all presentations 
will be subject to a review process.  Registration for the workshop will be 
open to all  ICLP '94 attendees.  Duration of the workshop is dependent upon 
the level of participation received, but is expected to be one-half day.  A copy
of the proceedings will be made available to all participants.

  This workshop follows the successful 5th Workshop
on Logic Programming Environments, held in conjunction with ILPS '93.

Submissions:
-----------

  Submissions are invited for presentation during the Workshop.
All presentations will be subject to peer review.  The bulk of
presentations is expected to be research papers, though posters and
software demonstrations (either live or on video tape) are also welcome.

  Papers submitted for presentation are restricted to 6 pages in
length.  Authors are encouraged to write in the style of a "position paper",
and also identify whether state-of-the-practice or state-of-the-art work 
is being described.  

  Participants wishing to make poster presentations or give demonstrations
must submit an abstract describing the work.  A note should
also be included discussing any equipment or presentation needs.

  The following guidelines apply to either type of submission:

 * The title, author name(s) and address(es) (both postal and electronic),
   and date must be clearly given on the first page.

 * The actual submission must be in machine-readable
   form (either self-contained LaTeX source document or PostScript 
   file), and submitted electronically (e.g. by electronic mail).

 * Submissions should be sent to 
	iclp-wlpe@idt.unit.no .
   Authors may wish to compress and uuencode large PostScript files 
   before sending them to increase the probably of their safe and 
   timely delivery ("compress" and "uuencode" are the standard 
   UNIX facilities by those names).

 * Participants can expect confirmation within a day of submission
   that their paper or abstract has been received and is printable.
   Otherwise, they should send an electronic mail message describing
   the situation to
	nytroe@idt.unit.no .

  Final drafts will also be required in machine-readable form, with
electronic submission.

\centerline{\normalsize DESCRIPTION}

\vspace{1mm}

Logic programming environments have come a long way from the original
text-based paradigm.  Much work has been done on the creation of better
logic programming environments.  Furthermore, the characteristics of
logic programming languages often motivate innovative approaches and
techniques in the areas of user environments and programming tools.

The Sixth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments will provide a
forum for researchers and logic programming system developers to
exchange ideas and results on all aspects of environments for logic
programming.  This includes work related to design issues, new
techniques and tools, and the solution of noteworthy problems arising,
for example, from new logic programming languages or interesting
application areas.  Both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art
presentations are welcome. Specific topic areas
relevant to the Workshop include, but are not be limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf user interfaces and human engineering}\\ {\it support of program
composition, execution control, intelligent or enhanced debugging,
embedded windowing \& graphics capabilities}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf execution visualization}
\\
{\it for program debugging, or performance analysis \& tuning}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf software development tools}
\\
{\it program composition aids, automatic transformation or induction
facilities, code partitioning \& module schemes}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf provisions for new paradigms}
\\
{\it special characteristics or techniques for dealing with logic
programming languages other than Prolog, such as parallel (LP)
languages, constraint-based (LP) languages, languages merging logical
\& functional paradigms, visual languages etc.}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf interfacing to other language system tools}
\\
{\it interfacing to partial evaluators, source-to-source trans\-formers,
global analyzers, abstract interpreters in the underlying language
system.}

\vspace{0.5mm}
\item
{\bf interfacing to external systems}
\\
{\it foreign language interfaces, database \& file system interfaces,
interfaces to external windowing \& graphics systems}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{2mm}
This workshop follows the successful Fifth Workshop on Logic Programming
Environments, held in conjunction with ILPS\,'93.  The workshop will be
informal in nature, allowing ample time for questions and discussions as
well as presentations. Registration for the workshop will be open to all
ICLP\,'94 attendees.  Duration of the workshop is dependent upon the
level of participation received, but is expected to be half a day.  A
copy of the proceedings will be made available to all participants.
