First Annual Conference on the
Pattern Languages of Programs

4 - 6 August, 1994
Monticello, Illinois

This international conference provides a forum for the presentation, 
exchange and refinement of patterns and pattern languages for computer
programs.  Patterns describe solutions to problems.  Patterns form a
language when woven together so as to provide a sequence or process
for the orderly resolution of problems.  Although borrowed from
Architecture, the conference organizers are confident of the
applicability of patterns and their languages to the design of
programs.  We ask that like minded researchers and practitioners take
up the pattern form and thereby contribute their wisdom and experience
to this new literature of computing.

Topics.  All aspects of programs and their production are suitable
topics of pattern languages.  Patterns might be so specific as to name
particular objects, interface elements or implementation structures in
a solution.  Or they could describe configurations of hardware,  
software or even people.  Patterns may or may not be specific to a
domain or programming language.

Papers.  The conference prefers papers written in the pattern form but
will accept some papers discusing aspects of the form or experience
using it.  The actual subject of patterns need not be original.  
Rather, preference will be shown to authors best able to exploit the
form in the field of computing.  Very liberal revision policies will 
insure authors can fold ideas gained at the conference into the
published proceedings.

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper, in
English, to the program chair by no later than May 16, 1994.  Email to
plop94@ee.pdx.edu.  Papers must be formatted in Postscript with only
the most comprehensive pattern languages to exceed 10 pages.  
Submissions must be prefaced with ascii text containing the papers
title, authors names, contact name, email address, postal address, 
phone number, and a 100-word abstract.  Papers must not be published or
under consideration elsewhere in the same or similar form.  Guidelines
for authors or assistance in electronic submission can be obtained from
the conference or program chair.

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by June 13.  
Revisions for electronic distribution to registrants are due July
11.  Final versions for publication are due September 15, roughly one
month after the conference.  Distribution of the proceedings will take
place as promptly as publication schedules permit.

Conference.  The conference will be held at Allerton House, a mansion
on a large, mostly wooded estate that is owned by the University of
Illinois.  Accommodations are available on site, in the nearby village
of Monticello or in Champaign-Urbana.  Airport limousine service is
available to the conference site.

In addition to single track presentations, the conference will offer
discussions of patterns in a workshop setting and a pattern writing
tutorial.  Every effort will be made to provide an informal and
creative atmosphere.  The committee is open to out-of-the-ordinary
submissions (write first) so long as they, like patterns, celebrate
that elusive quality called good design.
