                               July 28 - 29, 1994


The Third International SNePS Workshop will take place during the First
International Summer Institute in Cognitive Science to be held in July 1994 in
Buffalo, NY.  The first day of the two-day workshop will be devoted entirely to
a hands-on SNePS tutorial for people interested in learning about SNePS.  The
second day will be used for the presentation and discussion of SNePS-related
papers.  This is the call for papers; the call for tutorial participants will
be made in a separate announcement.



PURPOSE

The Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS), developed by Stuart C. Shapiro
et al., is the implementation of a fully intensional theory of knowledge
representation and reasoning.  Since its first incarnation in the early
seventies, the main goal driving its development has been the construction of
an artificial or computational cognitive agent capable of communicating
intelligently with other cognitive agents in natural language.  In the last
several years, many laboratories and individuals all over the world have
obtained copies of SNePS, and have been using it as a tool for their own
research or as part of implementations of applied AI systems.
    
One purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are using
SNePS in their ongoing research or for the development of applied AI systems,
to further communication and cooperation with other SNePS researchers, and to
promote the integration of independent developments.
    
However, the workshop is not exclusively aimed at users of SNePS.  The
knowledge representation and reasoning issues that SNePS tries to address are
genuine problems which are also tackled by many researchers outside the SNePS
community.  Contributions discussing such issues, in particular, if they do
closely relate to SNePS or to propositional knowledge representation in
general, are highly welcome.



CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite you to submit papers about applications of SNePS, as well as research
and position papers, preferably on topics directly related to SNePS or similar
knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms.  Such topics may include,
but are not limited to, any of the following:

    o General issues in knowledge representation
    o Theoretical foundations of propositional semantic networks
    o Natural language understanding and generation
    o Representation of and reasoning about plans and actions
    o Planning and acting
    o Reasoning about change
    o Nonmonotonic reasoning
    o Reason maintenance and belief revision
    o Belief representation and reasoning about nested beliefs
    o Efficient reasoning methods
    o Distributed knowledge bases and parallelization
    o Agent architectures and autonomous agents
    o Large scale knowledge bases
    o Relationships  of  SNePS  to  other  knowledge  representation  and
      reasoning systems
    o Applications of SNePS



SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors interested in presenting a paper should submit 5 copies of a
camera-ready full paper (not exceeding 10 pages) containing previously
unpublished work.  The first page of each paper should contain its title, the
name, affiliation, surface and e-mail address of each author, and an abstract.
All papers should be submitted on 8.5 x 11 inch or A4 paper, and printed in
12-point font.  Selection of papers will be based upon quality and relevance to
the theme of the workshop.  Submissions should be sent by hard mail, to arrive
by March 11, 1994, to:

      Hans Chalupsky
      Department of Computer Science
      226 Bell Hall
      State University of New York at Buffalo
      Buffalo, NY 14260
      USA

      Phone:   ++(716) 645-2879     Fax:   ++(716) 645-3464
      E-mail:  hans@cs.buffalo.edu

Authors will be informed by April 22, 1994 about acceptance of their paper.
The collection of accepted papers will be published as a technical report of
the Department of Computer Science of the State University of New York at
Buffalo.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX document formatting
system, because this will enable us to make the technical report available
on-line.



REGISTRATION AND FEES

Workshop participants have to register for at least the last week of the Summer
Institute for Cognitive Science (week 4) with form C given below.  The partial
registration fees for one week are US$ 350 for academic affiliates
(faculty/student), and US$ 650 for corporate affiliates.  It should be pointed
out that registering for the last week does entitle you to attend all lectures,
workshops and tutorials held during that week, not just the SNePS workshop.
Full registration for the whole Summer Institute or any partial registration
including the last week will of course also entitle you to attend the SNePS
workshop.
    
If you plan to attend the SNePS tutorial please send a short e-mail message
indicating that to hans@cs.buffalo.edu.  This will help us determine in advance
how many people to expect and what resources we will need.
    
To register for the SNePS workshop and/or tutorial please fill out form C below
(circle week 4 in the partial registration section) and send it to

      FISI-CS

 FISI-CS                   COURSE REQUEST FORM                         FORM B

 Each course will meet for a total of 15  hours  and  carry  1  semester
 credit  unit.   Your Institute Registration Fee of $750.00 (or $1800.00
 corporate) covers up to 3 credits (3 courses for 1  credit  each).   If
 you  wish to take additional courses for credit, there is an additional
 fee of $150.00 for each credit beyond the original 3.

 For each course that you list, please check one of the columns indicat-
 ing  whether  you are seeking graduate credit, undergraduate credit, or
 no credit for that course.  If these columns are left blank, it will be
 assumed that you are not taking the course for credit (No Credit is the
 default).

 Please consult the List of Courses for the 2-digit Course Identification No.
 and the Official  Course  Title.  We also suggest that you carefully review
 the Course Schedule in order to avoid registering for courses that will  be
 held simultaneously. Do not register for courses listed under the same time
 slot.   Since there are 7 time slots (4 on a M-W-F schedule and 3 on a T-TH
 schedule), the maximum number of courses that you can register for is 7.

                               July 28 - 29, 1994


The Third International SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) Workshop
will take place during the First International Summer Institute in Cognitive
Science to be held in July 1994 in Buffalo, NY.  The first day of the two-day
workshop will be devoted entirely to a hands-on SNePS tutorial for people
interested in learning about SNePS.  The second day will be used for the
presentation and discussion of SNePS-related papers.  This is the call for
papers; the call for tutorial participants will be made in a separate
announcement.



PURPOSE

The Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS), developed by Stuart C. Shapiro
et al., is the implementation of a fully intensional theory of knowledge
representation and reasoning.  Since its first incarnation in the early
seventies, the main goal driving its development has been the construction of
an artificial or computational cognitive agent capable of communicating
intelligently with other cognitive agents in natural language.  In the last
several years, many laboratories and individuals all over the world have
obtained copies of SNePS, and have been using it as a tool for their own
research or as part of implementations of applied AI systems.
    
One purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are using
SNePS in their ongoing research or for the development of applied AI systems,
to further communication and cooperation with other SNePS researchers, and to
promote the integration of independent developments.
    
However, the workshop is not exclusively aimed at users of SNePS.  The
knowledge representation and reasoning issues that SNePS tries to address are
genuine problems which are also tackled by many researchers outside the SNePS
community.  Contributions discussing such issues, in particular, if they do
closely relate to SNePS or to propositional knowledge representation in
general, are highly welcome.



CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite you to submit papers about applications of SNePS, as well as research
and position papers, preferably on topics directly related to SNePS or similar
knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms.  Such topics may include,
but are not limited to, any of the following:

    o General issues in knowledge representation
    o Theoretical foundations of propositional semantic networks
    o Natural language understanding and generation
    o Representation of and reasoning about plans and actions
    o Planning and acting
    o Reasoning about change
    o Nonmonotonic reasoning
    o Reason maintenance and belief revision
    o Belief representation and reasoning about nested beliefs
    o Efficient reasoning methods
    o Distributed knowledge bases and parallelization
    o Agent architectures and autonomous agents
    o Large scale knowledge bases
    o Relationships  of  SNePS  to  other  knowledge  representation  and
      reasoning systems
    o Applications of SNePS



SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors interested in presenting a paper should submit 5 copies of a
camera-ready full paper (not exceeding 10 pages) containing previously
unpublished work.  The first page of each paper should contain its title, the
name, affiliation, surface and e-mail address of each author, and an abstract.
All papers should be submitted on 8.5 x 11 inch or A4 paper, and printed in
12-point font.  Selection of papers will be based upon quality and relevance to
the theme of the workshop.  Submissions should be sent by hard mail, to arrive
by March 11, 1994, to:

      Hans Chalupsky
      Department of Computer Science
      226 Bell Hall
      State University of New York at Buffalo
      Buffalo, NY 14260
      USA

      Phone:   ++(716) 645-2879     Fax:   ++(716) 645-3464
      E-mail:  hans@cs.buffalo.edu

Authors will be informed by April 22, 1994 about acceptance of their paper.
The collection of accepted papers will be published as a technical report of
the Department of Computer Science of the State University of New York at
Buffalo.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX document formatting
system, because this will enable us to make the technical report available
on-line.



REGISTRATION AND FEES

Workshop participants have to register for at least the last week of the Summer
Institute for Cognitive Science (week 4) with form C given below.  The partial
registration fees for one week are US$ 350 for academic affiliates
(faculty/student), and US$ 650 for corporate affiliates.  It should be pointed
out that registering for the last week does entitle you to attend all lectures,
workshops and tutorials held during that week, not just the SNePS workshop.
Full registration for the whole Summer Institute or any partial registration
including the last week will of course also entitle you to attend the SNePS
workshop. There is still some financial aid available. Send e-mail to
hans@cs.buffalo.edu if you need more information about that.
    
If you plan to attend the SNePS tutorial please send a short e-mail message
indicating that to hans@cs.buffalo.edu.  This will help us determine in advance
how many people to expect and what resources we will need.
    
To register for the SNePS workshop and/or tutorial please fill out form C below
(circle week 4 in the partial registration section) and send it to

      FISI-CS

 Each course will meet for a total of 15  hours  and  carry  1  semester
 credit  unit.   Your Institute Registration Fee of $750.00 (or $1800.00
 corporate) covers up to 3 credits (3 courses for 1  credit  each).   If
 you  wish to take additional courses for credit, there is an additional
 fee of $150.00 for each credit beyond the original 3.

 For each course that you list, please check one of the columns indicat-
 ing  whether  you are seeking graduate credit, undergraduate credit, or
 no credit for that course.  If these columns are left blank, it will be
 assumed that you are not taking the course for credit (No Credit is the
 default).

 Please consult the List of Courses for the 2-digit Course Identification No.
 and the Official  Course  Title.  We also suggest that you carefully review
 the Course Schedule in order to avoid registering for courses that will  be
 held simultaneously. Do not register for courses listed under the same time
 slot.   Since there are 7 time slots (4 on a M-W-F schedule and 3 on a T-TH
 schedule), the maximum number of courses that you can register for is 7.

*******************************************************************************

EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: June 6, 1994

NOTE: Deadline for early full-session registration (4 weeks) is April 30, 1994!
      Registration fees for partial registration (per week) are not affected
      (only partial registration is necessary to attend the SNePS workshop).

*******************************************************************************

The Third International SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) Workshop
will take place during the First International Summer Institute in Cognitive
Science to be held in July 1994 in Buffalo, NY.  The first day of the two-day
workshop will be devoted entirely to a hands-on SNePS tutorial for people
interested in learning about SNePS.  The second day will be used for the
presentation and discussion of SNePS-related papers.



PURPOSE

The Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS), developed by Stuart C. Shapiro
et al., is the implementation of a fully intensional theory of knowledge
representation and reasoning.  Since its first incarnation in the early
seventies, the main goal driving its development has been the construction of
an artificial or computational cognitive agent capable of communicating
intelligently with other cognitive agents in natural language.  In the last
several years, many laboratories and individuals all over the world have
obtained copies of SNePS, and have been using it as a tool for their own
research or as part of implementations of applied AI systems.
    
One purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are using
SNePS in their ongoing research or for the development of applied AI systems,
to further communication and cooperation with other SNePS researchers, and to
promote the integration of independent developments.
    
However, the workshop is not exclusively aimed at users of SNePS.  The
knowledge representation and reasoning issues that SNePS tries to address are
genuine problems which are also tackled by many researchers outside the SNePS
community.  Contributions discussing such issues, in particular, if they do
closely relate to SNePS or to propositional knowledge representation in
general, are highly welcome.



CALL FOR PAPERS

We invite you to submit papers about applications of SNePS, as well as research
and position papers, preferably on topics directly related to SNePS or similar
knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms.  Such topics may include,
but are not limited to, any of the following:

    o General issues in knowledge representation
    o Theoretical foundations of propositional semantic networks
    o Natural language understanding and generation
    o Representation of and reasoning about plans and actions
    o Planning and acting
    o Reasoning about change
    o Nonmonotonic reasoning
    o Reason maintenance and belief revision
    o Belief representation and reasoning about nested beliefs
    o Efficient reasoning methods
    o Distributed knowledge bases and parallelization
    o Agent architectures and autonomous agents
    o Large scale knowledge bases
    o Relationships  of  SNePS  to  other  knowledge  representation  and
      reasoning systems
    o Applications of SNePS



SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors interested in presenting a paper should submit 5 copies of a
camera-ready full paper (not exceeding 10 pages) containing previously
unpublished work.  The first page of each paper should contain its title, the
name, affiliation, surface and e-mail address of each author, and an abstract.
All papers should be submitted on 8.5 x 11 inch or A4 paper, and printed in
12-point font.  Selection of papers will be based upon quality and relevance to
the theme of the workshop.  Submissions should be sent by hard mail, to arrive
by June 6, 1994, to:

      Hans Chalupsky
      Department of Computer Science
      226 Bell Hall
      State University of New York at Buffalo
      Buffalo, NY 14260
      USA

      Phone:   ++(716) 645-2879     Fax:   ++(716) 645-3464
      E-mail:  <hans@cs.buffalo.edu>

Authors will be informed by early July about acceptance of their paper.
The collection of accepted papers will be published as a technical report of
the Department of Computer Science of the State University of New York at
Buffalo.  Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX document formatting
system, because this will enable us to make the technical report available
on-line.



REGISTRATION AND FEES

Workshop participants have to register for at least the last week of the
Summer Institute for Cognitive Science (week 4) with form C given below.  The
partial registration fees for one week are US$ 350 for academic affiliates
(faculty/student), and US$ 650 for corporate affiliates.  It should be
pointed out that registering for the last week does entitle you to attend all
lectures, workshops and tutorials held during that week, not just the SNePS
workshop.  Full registration for the whole Summer Institute or any partial
registration including the last week will of course also entitle you to attend
the SNePS workshop.
    
To register for the SNePS workshop and/or tutorial please do the following:

1) Send a short e-mail message to <hans@cs.buffalo.edu> indicating
   whether you want to attend the workshop and/or tutorial.

2) If you want to attend the SNePS workshop and/or tutorial but
   not the entire four-week FISI-CS session fill out form C below
   (circle week 4 in the partial registration section) and send it
   **by postal/surface/snail mail** (not e-mail) to
