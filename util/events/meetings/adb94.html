=========================== CALL FOR PAPERS ===============================


    1994 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF DATABASES (ADB-94)

          June 21-23, 1994, Vadstena Monastery Hotel, Sweden

Successful database research and development has made many general database
systems available.  The industrial offerings  range from  traditional large
mainframe systems, through workstation & PC  servers, to mass-produced $100
personal systems. Users, application  designers, and the  software industry
strive to get the   most from this  technology.  Database  researchers, and
developers try hard  to further satisfy  application needs. The  conference
aims at developing synergy between these communities. It is intended as the
forum  to explore innovative   applications  of databases,  and  innovative
database services for specific applications.

CONFERENCE LOCATION:
====================

The town of Vadstena is located about 300 km. south of Stockholm, bordering
lake Vattern, the 2nd largest lake  in Sweden. Vadstena  is a medieval town
with cobbled streets, an  ancient abbey and castle.  It is near the town of
Linkoping,  center for high-tech industry, and  home  of one of the largest
universities in Sweden. The   conference site is the  monastery  originally
built  as a royal  palace in 1258, pre-dating  Stockholm. It  is the oldest
secular building in Sweden. The conference week includes the longest day of
the year, when  there is light all night  in Vadstena  and midnight sun  in
northern  Sweden.  June  24 is  also  the national   'Midsummer' holiday in
Sweden,  when many ethnic celebrations  take  place. June/July is about the
best time for vacations in Scandinavia.
