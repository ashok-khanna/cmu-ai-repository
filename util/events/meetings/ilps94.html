                   LAST CALL FOR PAPERS ILPS'94
              INTERNATIONAL LOGIC PROGRAMMING SYMPOSIUM

           Sheraton Inn, Ithaca, NY, November 13 - 17  1994
          Sponsored by the Association of Logic Programming


Papers must be written in English, must not exceed 15 pages (including
references and figures), and must contain a cover page including the
following: a 200 word abstract, keywords, and postal and electronic mailing
addresses as well as phone numbers and fax numbers of the corresponding author.
Submitted papers should not have been previously published or submitted to
any journals or refereed conferences or workshops. Accepted papers must be
presented at the conference. Send six (6) copies of your submission by
APRIL 8, 1994 to

                  Maurice Bruynooghe ILPS94
                  KUL, Dept. Computer Science
                  Celestijnenlaan 200 A
                  B3001 Heverlee, Belgium

To facilitate careful selection of reviewers, it is recommended to send an
email to maurice@cs.kuleuven.ac.be with title, name of authors and AT MOST
5 LINES description of the subject of the paper before April 1. Authors will
be notified of the acceptance or rejection of their papers by July 15, 1994.
Final versions of the accepted papers must be received in camera-ready form
by August 12, 1994.  The proceedings will be published by MIT Press.
===========================================================================

General Chairs: Victor Marek (marek@ms.uky.edu) , Anil Nerode
(anil@math.cornell.edu). General inquiries can be sent to
ilps@msiadmin.cit.cornell.edu..
===========================================================================
Additional Information:

Deadline APRIL 8: If you send an email by April 1 and airmail your
submission by April 8 then it will be taken into consideration.

Originality of submission: at almost every PC meeting there is a problem
with originality of some submissions. If you have related work which is
(recently) accepted, or is submitted or will be submitted before july 15
and the relationship is not clear from your ILPS  submission, then it would
be very much appreciated if you explain the relationship between your
different works in an appendix. In some cases it can be desirable to
include one copy of the related work, so that the PC has not to made wet
finger decisions about the degree of overlap.

15 pages: this has to be applied with common sense, there is no need to
spend days of hacking to get an optimal page utilisation and get the paper
 on 15 pages. However, you should realise that your final paper should
fit in 15 MIT-Press pages (often approximated at 5000 words) and that your
submission is intended to be a first draft of your final paper. If you
include so much material that it clearly does not fit the 15 MIT-Press
pages (whatever the length of your submission) then your submission is in
serious trouble. The reviewers can appreciate if you include some material
in appendix, material they otherwise might have to look up in not always
easily accessible sources. The easiest way to avoid disputes is to use
the MIT style file for your submission. However, there is no obligation.

Full call for papers as well as the MIT style file is available
by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.kuleuven.ac.be where there is a directory for
ILPS under the path /pub/compulog/ILPS94/

               Call For Workshop Proposals - ILPS'94
             INTERNATIONAL LOGIC PROGRAMMING SYMPOSIUM
         Sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming
                    Post-Conference Workshops
 
Ithaca, New York, USA
November 13 -- 19, 1994


The 1994 International Logic Programming Symposium will be held 
November 13-19, 1994, in Ithaca, New York, USA. Up to six post-conference 
workshops are planned for November 18-19.  Researchers from all areas of 
logic programming are invited to submit proposals.

To encourage active participation and exchange of ideas, the workshops will 
be kept small, preferably under 40 participants. The format of the workshop 
will be determined by the organizer(s) proposing the workshop, but ample 
time must be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can vary in length, 
but the optimal duration will be half a day or a full day.  Having two or 
three co-organizers for a workshop is strongly advised.  Workshops are 
particularly appropriate for specialized subcommunities of researchers for
whom a larger workshop or conference is not yet justified.

Proposals for workshops should be about two pages in length, and 
should contain:

o   A description of the workshop, identifying specific technical 
    issues that will be addressed.
o   A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop. 
o   The name, postal address, phone and fax numbers, and email
    address of the workshop organizer(s) and identification of the 
    principal contact person. 
o   A proposed schedule for organizing the workshop, a preliminary 
    agenda, and the indication of the length of the workshop.

Proposals should be submitted no later than May 16, 1994. Organizers will 
be notified no later than June 16, 1994.

Workshop organizers will be responsible for:

o   Producing a "Call for Participation" in the workshop and posting it 
    via various electronic lists and/or other means.
o   Reviewing requests to participate in the workshop and selecting 
    participants.
o   Scheduling workshop activities.

Please submit proposals and inquiries (hardcopy or e-mail) to:
