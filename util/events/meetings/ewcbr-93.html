Dear Colleague,

please, find the program of the European Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning
below.  Note that only a limited number of places are available and most of
them already booked. Thus, if you want to attend the workshop, please,
register quickly.  The deadline for early registration is September 15th.  For
students, there are still some travel grants available.

			Kaiserslautern (Germany)

		        Call for Partizipation

			  Program Schedule

===============================================================================


General Information:

The scientific program will include 21 presentations of selected papers, four
invited talks, system demonstrations, two poster sessions (with 50 posters) as
well as one panel discussion. An overview on case-based reasoning as well as
the presentation of commercial CBR systems is planned for the first day.

EWCBR-93 is thought of as a kick-off event for CBR in Europe, and with 92
submissions already had a good start. EWCBR-93 will be open for everyone
who wants to attend. But, since the number of participants is restricted,
please, register at our conference office as quick as possible
(via fax or ordinary mail).

Please, find additional information below, especially a form sheet for
registration for EWCBR-93. Send the completed sheet to the conference
office (mail or fax).

EWCBR-93 will take place in the European Academy Otzenhausen.
Known at the time as the "Europe House Otzenhausen", the European Academy was
founded by the European Union in May 1954 as a meeting place for promoting
Franco-German reconciliation, especially among young people. With the signing
of the Treaty of Rome and the birth of the European Community it was decided to
develop the Europe House Otzenhausen for European Youth and adult education
and as an information center. In 1969, with the subsequent increase in the
volume of work, staff, and premises the Europe House Otzenhausen became the
first education center to be called a European Academy. It is not aligned with
any political party or religious denomination. The Academy is situated in woods
on the edge of the village of Otzenhausen between Trier and Kaiserslautern
(south-west of Germany).

Accommodation per person (including all meals from Sunday evening until Friday
Lunch) costs 500 DM in double rooms. For single rooms the costs increase to
650 DM.

Please, note that the overall number of participants at EWCBR (especially the
number of single rooms) is restricted.
