			CALL FOR PAPERS
		TIMS XXXII International Meeting
		Anchorage, Alaska, June 12-15, 1994

I am organizing a cluster of sessions on fuzzy sets at the TIMS XXXII Inter-
national Meeting in Anchorage. This e-mail is an invitation to submit papers
on topics where fuzzy set theory is applied in management or used as a basis
for developing more useful models in management science and operations research;fuzzy set theory applied to the development of knowledge based systems will
also be a relevant topic.

Send 50 word, non-technical abstracts of your intended contribution by fax or
e-mail by October 4, 1993; this is, however, a fuzzy number - contributions are
accepted until October 10; please also include your name and address, including
e-mail address and fax. Instructions on how to prepare the paper will be sent
to those who submit abstracts.

The TIMS XXXII International Meeting promises to be a very good conference,
and I have been told that Alaska is nice in June - the mosquitos are not yet
up to full strength.
