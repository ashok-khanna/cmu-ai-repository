                         CALL FOR PROPOSALS
 
                  NIPS*94 Post-Conference Workshops
 
                       December 2 and 3, 1994
                           Vail, Colorado
 
  Following the regular program of the Neural Information Processing
  Systems 1994 conference, workshops on current topics in neural
  information processing will be held on December 2 and 3, 1994, in
  Vail, Colorado.  Proposals by qualified individuals interested in
  chairing one of these workshops are solicited.  Past topics have
  included: active learning and control, architectural issues,
  attention, bayesian analysis, benchmarking neural network
  applications, computational complexity issues, computational
  neuroscience, fast training techniques, genetic algorithms, music,
  neural network dynamics, optimization, recurrent nets, rules and
  connectionist models, self- organization, sensory biophysics, speech,
  time series prediction, vision and audition, implementations, and
  grammars.
 
  The goal of the workshops is to provide an informal forum for
  researchers to discuss important issues of current interest.  Sessions
  will meet in the morning and in the afternoon of both days, with free
  time in between for ongoing individual exchange or outdoor activities.
  Concrete open and/or controversial issues are encouraged and preferred
  as workshop topics.  Representation of alternative viewpoints and
  panel-style discussions are particularly encouraged.  Individuals
  proposing to chair a workshop will have responsibilities including:
  1) arranging short informal presentations by experts working on the
  topic, 2) moderating or leading the discussion and reporting its high
  points, findings, and conclusions to the group during evening plenary
  sessions (the ``gong show''), and 3) writing a brief summary.
 
  Submission Procedure: Interested parties should submit a short
  proposal for a workshop of interest postmarked by May 21, 1994.
  (Express mail is   not   necessary.  Submissions by electronic
  mail will also be accepted.)  Proposals should include a title, a
  description of what the workshop is to address and accomplish, the
  proposed length of the workshop (one day or two days), and the planned
  format.  It should motivate why the topic is of interest or
  controversial, why it should be discussed and what the targeted group
  of participants is.  In addition, please send a brief resume of the
  prospective workshop chair, a list of publications and evidence of
  scholarship in the field of interest.
 
  Mail submissions to:
 
  Todd K. Leen, NIPS*94 Workshops Chair

  Oregon 97291-1000  USA
 
  (e-mail: tleen@cse.ogi.edu)
 
  Name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail net
  address should be on all submissions.

This year's NIPS conference will use reviewing procedures similar to those
of AAAI and IJCAI.  I've served on the program committees of all three; I
know how important it is to provide adequate feedback to authors.  As of
this year, reviews without comments will not be accepted from any NIPS
referee.  Another change is that, for the first time, we're asking authors
for drafts of full papers instead of extended abstracts; this should make it
easier for referees to evaluate the technical content of submissions.

The submission deadline is May 21.  I've appended the call for papers to
this note, though you've probably seen it before.

For registration materials or general info, send mail to
nips94@caltech.edu.  Please don't send mail to me directly; I have enough
to worry about already.
