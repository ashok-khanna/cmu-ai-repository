              "Fuzzy Logic VLSI Implementations and Applications"

                           9 - 11 June 1993

                 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
                            EPFL-Lausanne

                             Switzerland


Objective
---------

This three-day seminar is the first part of 13-day course. The idea of this
course is to provide participants with the necessary bekground covering fuzzy
sets theory and fuzzy logic along with demonstrations of practical solutions.
CMOS VLSI design and implementation as well as fuzzy system simulation will be
presented in details.

             "Practical Problem Solving Using Fuzzy Technology"

                            June 9 - 25, 1993
                                  and
                          September 20 - 24, 1993

                   Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
                              EPFL-Lausanne

                               Switzerland
 

Objective
---------

This four weeks course/workshop is an international course in cooperation with
the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Minesota, USA. The idea
of this course is to provide participants the necessary bakground covering the
fuzzy sets theory and fuzzy logic (first week) along with demonstrations of
practical solutions (second and third week). CMOS VLSI design and implementation
as well as fuzzy system simulation will be presented. The second and third week
are dedicated to the design of a Fuzzy logic based chip, which will be
fabricated and tested in the fourth week (20 to 24 September 1993).

Outline
-------
  
	Week I:		Introduction to Fuzzy Logic Theory
	Week II:	Project formulation and solving
	Week III:	Project simulation and fuzzy ASIC chip design
	Week IV:	Chip testing (after manufacturing)

Who should attend ? 
-------------------

Electronic and computer engineers, company decision makers, VLSI and ASIC
designers, university & high school students. Participants are free to attend
the part I (first three days), or part II (three weeks), or to combine part I
and part II of the Seminar/Workshop.

Fees
----

Three days (part I)	SFr. 800.-	
Four weeks (part II)	SFr. 4,500.-*

Fees cover Notebooks, slide copies, program materials, break refreshments and
lunches. In case of the Workshop organizers will help with accomodation in
Lausanne.
