Methodology and Industrial Applications


September 19: FALCON-Meeting (European Working group on Fuzzy 
Algorithms in Control)

Invitation by the General Chairman

As the General Chairman of EUFIT  '94 it is a pleasure to invite you to 
participate in this Conference in Aachen where the charm of 1200 
years of history merges with most advanced technological research 
performed in the "RWTH", the largest European Institute of 
Technology with almost 40 000 students and six different Colleges of 
Engineering.

The last two decades have witnessed a very strong growth of 
theoretical areas related to Fuzzy Set Theory and Neural Networks. 
Since the beginning of the seventies these techniques have 
also been applied to a variety of problems. To an increasing degree 
they are merged with other approaches in the area of "Intelligent 
Techniques". "Intelligent Techniques" is not a crisply defined area. It 
includes Fuzzy Logic as well as Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, 
Tabu-Search, Expert System Technology as well as Data Analysis 
and Control Theory. It is therefore not surprising that numerous 
disciplines have contributed to this area such as Artificial 
Intelligence, Control Engineering, Operations Research, Decision 
Theory, Logics, Psychology, Computer Science and, of course, 
Mathematics. 

In addition to the problems caused by the interdisciplinary approach, 
Europe is characterized by a number of features which lead to 
additional problems, but also to additional challenges 
and additional potentials: the multi-cultural and multi-lingual 
environment in Europe makes communication between the different 
countries difficult, expensive and time-consuming. There exists the 
danger that the wheel is invented several times at different locations 
in Europe and that overall research efficiency in Europe decreases 
compared to other continents. Therefore it seems to be of particular 
importance in Europe to facilitate and strengthen communication and 
cooperation between scientists and practitioners in different European 
countries. This is exactly what EUFIT '93, the last year conference on 
the same topic, tried to achieve.

EUFIT '94 builds on the success and experience of last year's 
conference. We shall try again to accommodate newcomers to the 
area as well as experts, theorists as well as practitioners, and 
participants from East and West, North and South. This time, 
however, the conference focuses not only on Fuzzy Technology but 
combines the areas of Fuzzy Logic, Neural Nets, and Evolutionary 
Computing including Genetic Algorithms.

Aachen lends itself as a location for this Conference for several 
reasons: it is a city which is used to interdisciplinary research of 
engineering science and social science faculties; it is a city 
in which the cultures of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany 
merge and a city which is very friendly, hospitable and open minded. 
Aachen is also a location where active research of various kinds has 
been performed in the area of Fuzzy Set Theory since the beginning 
of the seventies, with the university in which theory and applications 
of Fuzzy Sets have been taught on a regular basis since the 
beginning of the eighties and it is also the location of ELITE, the 
European Laboratory for Intelligent Techniques Engineering which 
has as the main goal to advance and facilitate the European 
ooperation in the area of Intelligent Techniques.

I am most thankful to all members of the Programme Committee and 
the Organization Committee for their continued help and support. I 
also thank the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH) that this time 
hosts the conference. A special recognition goes to the staff of 
ELITE and MIT without whose enthusiastic activities this Conference 
would not have been possible. I am also most thankful to all the 
colleagues that have agreed to offer tutorials, to all speakers at the 
Conference and, of course, to all participants that will come to Aachen 
and that will make this conference as successful as EUFIT '93, the 
most important event in this area in Europe in 1994. I hope that all of 
you will benefit from the scientific programme as well as from the 
social events and the exhibition. I am sure you will enjoy
Aachen and hopefully return to Aachen often in the future.
