D E S C R I P T I O N  OF  THE  T U T O R I A L S



Tutorial A 	Golshani F.
"Multimedia Information Systems"


Modern workstations that work with audio and video digitizers, and image
and audio synthesis devices have paved the way for multimedia database systems.

These systems are expected to radically change the way we store, access and
manipulate information. Numerous data processing applications, including those
in finance, medicine, legal and insurance, will see drastic improvements when
the integration of different media in computing systems has been achieved.
This course will emphasize design, use and applications of multimedia
information systems.

Participants will receive a technical introduction to different media such as
images, audio and text, and will learn how to develop integrated multimedia
systems.

Key steps in the process of development, including acquisition, compression,
storage, retrieval, and presentation of objects of each media will be covered.
When appropriate, comparisons of alternative techniques will be provided.

_________________________________________________________________________________


Tutorial B	Engels G., Kappel G.

"Object-Oriented System Development - From Analysis to Implementation"



Object-oriented system development is widely recognized as improving
productivity and reducing system maintenance costs.

Since the late eighties an ever growing number of methods covering (part of)
object-oriented analysis, design and implementation has been proposed.

Independent from any concrete object-oriented method, however, there are three
important questions, equally relevant to practitioners and researchers.

Firstly, what are the concepts, tasks, and results of analysis, design and
implementation in an object-oriented framework to system development and how do
they relate to each other?

Secondly, how does object-oriented system development compare to traditional
approaches?

And thirdly, what are the pitfalls of object-oriented system development and
how to cope with them? The tutorial will provide answers to all three questions
in concert.


_________________________________________________________________________________


Tutorial C	Bench-Capon T.
"Applying Knowledge Based Techniques to Legal Applications"



The domain of law has been a fertile area for the application of knowledge based
systems techniques. The legal domain presents an opportunity to apply the whole
range of these techniques to a domain which is well documented, has strong
theoretical foundations, and the potential for widespread commercial exploitation.
In this tutorial the special features of the legal domain will be discussed and
leading approaches and systems described from the following perspectives: the
task to be supported; the formalism used; and the reasoning methods modelled.

The tutorial will conclude with a review of the current state of the art,
and some indication of prospects and future developments.

HOTEL  ACCOMMODATION

The Czech Technical University has reserved a sufficient number of rooms
in different hotel categories for the participants of the DEXA 93 for
the period September 5-9, 1993. The offer ranges from the  accommodation
in the University Conference Hotel KRYSTAL where the conference will be
held to Hotel DIPLOMAT which belongs to the top-level Prague hotels.
Hotel KRYSTAL was opened in 1990, each room is equipped with shower + WC.


Please use the registration form.

CATEGORY		SINGLE ROOM	        DOUBLE ROOM

     3 (DIPLOMAT)	ATS     3.000,-	        ATS     3.200,-

The daily room rates are quoted in Austrian Schillings (ATS).

With your signature you reserve a room for the DEXA 93 Conference.
Please fill in your dates of arrival and departure.
You will be booked in the required category if still available.
If not, you will be booked in the next higher category.

Please make your payment to the DEXA account:

DEXA 93

DEADLINE FOR PAYMENT OF THE ACCOMMODATION:
JULY 15, 1993


The Organizing Committee appologizes to all participants of the DEXA 93
for the inconvenience of asking for rather early payment.
Its main reason is that Prague attracts a lot of visitors actually and
most of its facilities have to be booked and pre-paid well in advance.

*


Troja Castle is a castle in the Roman Baroque Neo-classical style,
built in 1679-85, situated in a nice garden in the French style.
Visitors might be startled by the stately stairway decorated with
sculptural groups of the battle of the Titans by J. and P.Heermanns.
The interiors have magnificent decorations.
The castle hosts a permanent exhibition of Czech art of the 19th century
and of Baroque glass from the collection of the Gallery of the Capital
City of Prague.


Laterna Magica:
Each performance of this theatre is a magical combination of several
theatre genres, namely ballet and black theatre, with audio-visual
techniques.
The first performance took place at the Brussels World Fair in 1958
and it was very successfully accepted both by audience and by the critics.
Since then the theatre became world-famous and it has been invited to many
places all over the world. It gradually extends the used methods and it
adopts most modern performance techniques in order to reach the highest
impression.
