Please feel free to post the call electronically and physically.

        *** CALL FOR REVIEWERS ***

To help carry out the peer review process for the Cognitive Science
conference, we are seeking reviewers who are expert in one or more of the
multiple areas that are represented at the conference, and who have actively
participated in the conference in the past years.  If you are interested in
being considered as a reviewer for the conference, or know of someone else
who should be, please fill out a reviewer nomination form and submit it as
soon as possible.  Forms are available electronically from
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/cogsci94 in:
  call-for-reviewers.txt (plain text, suitable for electronic submission)
  call-for-reviewers.word.bin (microsoft word/macbinary, suitable for hard copy)

        *** FTP INSTRUCTIONS ***

The above files are available through anonymous FTP from ftp.cc.gatech.edu.
Type "ftp ftp.cc.gatech.edu" (or "ftp 130.207.7.245"), login as "anonymous",
and enter your e-mail address as password.  Now type "cd /pub/cogsci94", and
"ls" to list the available files.  To retrieve a file, type "get filename".
Note that ".bin" files should be retrieved in binary mode; type "binary" to
enter binary mode, followed by "get filename.bin" to download the file you
want.  If you use a Macintosh, you probably want to get hold of "Fetch",
which gives you a Macintosh-style interface for easy FTP retrieval; send
e-mail to Fetch@Dartmouth.edu for more info.
