           "...one of the central goals of AI is to develop artificial
           agents that embody all the components  of intelligence ..."

SCOPE
=====
  The AIA Round-table is  an  international  periodical  forum  of 
researchers  and practitioners from  different  fields  to  confront  
recent results and opinions on formal and integrated  construction  
of domain  and carrier independent intelligent  systems  ( abstract 
intelligent agents).
  In the near future, an abstract intelligent agent will be the basic
conceptual element  of different  knowledge-based software systems and
an  important  reference  framework  for identification of intelligent 
behavior of real-world (natural) systems.

  The goal of the AIA Round-Table can  be viewed from two different 
perspectives:

  In the ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE, it is promotion of all these ideas 
which can lead to model-based design of reasoning modules for highly 
autonomous robots or other KB software systems, for example intelligent:
    plant-operator support system, management decision-support,
    CIM/CASE conceptual design support, tutoring systems,
    groupware/cooperation/coordination software tools.
All these systems should autonomously support humans in the specifica-
tion and solving of complex, incomplete,  and  ill-defined  problems
situated in the real-world. An AIA is a  key  theoretical base for
the performance of this task.
  In the SOCIO-COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE, AIA can be  considered as an
abstract conceptual frame  for modeling  the behavior  of  living 
organism recognized as intelligent. It  can  provide a conceptual and
terminological "bridge"  between  natural  (evolutional) and artificial
(designed) systems  for  their  simulations,  as well  as for teaching, 
diagnosis and  treatment. These  applications should be interesting for
psychology, sociology, organization research or economy.

  Contrary to physical systems which behave according to externally 
observed initial  states  and  physical  laws, the  behavior  of an
intelligent agent  also  depends  on  its  unobserved  and  variable 
"mental" states represented by  such abstract concepts as information,
goal, preference, knowledge. According to AIA93 conclusions, they form
a conceptual web which can be interpreted as the architecture of AIA.
  The goal-oriented intelligent reasoning includes many activities and
functions such as: conceptualization, recognition, decision-making, 
learning, discovery, situation assessment and planning.These activities
applied recursively and repeatedly are necessary generic elements of 
of AIA "behavior".
  The specific  subject of the AIA94 meeting is SITUATION ASSESSMENT,
one of the fundamental "mental" functions of intelligent system 
interacting with its environment. AIA views every situation in the 
context of its goal-oriented activity.
Situation assessment is a repetitive and recursive phase of AIA 
reasoning, it  produces initial data for the planning phase, and	
it may also be viewed as a problem specification  before  problem 
solving.

  TOPICS
  ======
  The topics of the meeting regard:
  -  a 'situation assessment' (S-A) on different abstraction levels,
     domain independent, and applied in different domains of 
     intelligent agent activities, 
  -  S-A in the contexts of the agent's possibilities, preferences, 
     motivations, emotions and goals.
  -  general problems of AIA construction,
  Contributions to the following subjects are welcome:
  -  architecture of intelligent agents in different contexts,
  -  the role of consciousness of AIA,
  -  formal structure of  S-A in physical and abstract environments,
  -  S-A in learning, discovery, autonomous robot task execution,
  -  S-A in multi-agent worlds; organization management, cooperation,
     negotiation, tutoring,
  -  S-A in plant supervision and control, in emergency management,
     under risk and stress,
  -  S-A and the frame problem in artificial intelligence.
  Debate Sessions
  ---------------
  The debate sessions will also concern more general topics, such as:
  paradigms, methodologies and methods for AIA conceptualization
  and analysis, terminology, hierarchy  and  recursive nature of 
  AIA  "mental"  functions, as  well as  AIA visions of physical 
  and social environments.

  The Round-Table is open to all new ideas and new points of view 
related to the concept AIA.
  International periodical AIA Round-Table wishes to offer an
intellectual challenge for practitioners and researchers.The organizers
strongly encourage the participation of those who acquired their
experience working across disciplinary  boundaries.

                                             AIA94 Chairman
