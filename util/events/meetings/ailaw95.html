                            Call for Papers

     Fifth International Conference on ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and LAW

                            May 21-24, 1995
           University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA

Sponsored by:
*The International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL)
*The University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)
*In cooperation with
    The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGART)
    The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)

The field of AI and law is concerned with:
 - the investigation of legal reasoning using computational methods
 - applications which use AI techniques to support tasks in the legal domain
 - the investigation of AI techniques using law as the example domain.

This International Conference will again be held under the auspices of the
International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL), an
organisation devoted to promoting research and development in the field of
AI and Law with members in twenty-three countries. ICAIL-95 will provide a
forum for the presention and discussion of the latest research results and
practical applications and will stimulate interdisciplinary and international
collaboration in the growing AI and Law community.  Previous meetings of the
International Conference have taken place in Boston (1987), Vancouver (1989),
Oxford (1991) and Amsterdam (1993). As for the previous conferences, accepted
papers will be published by ACM Press.

Authors are invited to submit papers on topics including but not restricted to:
        --Legal Expert Systems
        --Conceptual Information Retrieval
        --Case-Based Reasoning
        --Representation of Legal and Common Sense Knowledge
        --Computational Models of Legal Reasoning
        --Applications of AI to Law

Papers on theoretical issues in AI and in jurisprudence or legal philosophy
are invited provided that the relevance to AI and Law is clearly demonstrated.
Papers on applications should include a description of the nature and purpose
of the application, the techniques employed, and the current state of
implementation. Submissions must be received by January 10, 1995. Papers
should not exceed 5000 words. Short papers not exceeding 2500 words are also
invited, particularly in the area of "applications experience".  All papers
will be reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. To assist the
reviewing process, intending authors are asked to send an e-mail abstract to
the programme chair by 15 December 1994.  This abstract should include the
title of the paper, up to four keywords and a contact address for the main
author. Papers should be submitted by sending six (6) copies of the complete
paper to the Programme Chair. Only hard copy submissions of full papers will
be accepted.
