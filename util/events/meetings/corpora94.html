SECOND ANNUAL WORKSHOP ON VERY LARGE CORPORA

Call for Papers

WHEN: August 4, 1994 (just before Coling-94)
WHERE: Kyoto International Community House (Tentative), Kyoto, Japan

Corpus linguistics continues to be a hot topic.  Text is more
available than ever before.  All of this data provides a great
opportunity, as evidenced by all of the recent activity in Europe,
Asia and America, some of which was discussed at last year's meeting
in Ohio, just before ACL-93.

This year, there will be a special emphasis on parallel texts such as
the Canadian Hansards.  Parallel texts have been used to study machine
translation, bilingual lexicography, and terminology research for
human translators.  As a result, there has been considerable interest
in alignment programs that decide which parts of the source text
correspond to which parts of the target text.  Performance has been
extremely promising, especially for pairs of European languages, though
it remains an open question how well these methods might generalize to a
broader range of language pairs such as English/Japanese.

Authors should submit three copies of a full-length paper (5-10 pages)
to the program chair by March 1, 1994.  Paper submissions are strongly
preferred over electronic submissions.  Notifications of acceptance or
rejection will be sent out by April 15, 1994.  Relevant topics include
(but are not limited to)

    Text Analysis Techniques:
	    - alignment of parallel text
            - ``robust'' parsing
            - part of speech tagging
            - sense tagging
            - identification of phrases
            - collocation
            - morphology
            - discourse structure

    Applications:
	    - Translation
	    - Lexicography
	    - Terminology
            - Information Retrieval (IR)
            - Recognition: Speech, OCR, handwriting, etc.
            - Spelling Correction

Program Chairs:
    Pierre Isabelle
    Kenneth Church

Program Committee:
