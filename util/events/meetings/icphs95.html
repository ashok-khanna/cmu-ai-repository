            XIIIth INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHONETIC SCIENCES
                            (ICPhS 95)
                 Stockholm, Sweden, August 13-19, 1995

FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT - please respond (see end of message) 


Dear Colleagues,
	It is our pleasure to invite you to the XIIIth International Congress of Phonetic 
Sciences, ICPhS 95. It will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, August 13-19, 1995.
	The congress is a joint venture of our two departments, but with organisational 
and scientific support from the entire Swedish phonetics community. As usual, the 
congress will invite contributions from all aspects of the phonetic sciences in the 
broadest sense.
	With four years between congresses in this series, we look forward to intense 
discussion and exchange of new results in phonetics. We believe that Stockholm, in 
August 1995, will be a good setting for this. 
	The weather in Stockholm in August is often very comfortable, with long 
daylight and daily high temperatures around 20: C. The Stockholm Water Festival will 
most likely take place immediately preceding ICPhS 95.
	We are also pleased to report that the recent economic changes have made prices 
of accommodation and food in Sweden very reasonable for most visitors.
	Our two departments, the Swedish phonetics community and the Congrex 
congress bureau will do our best to make your stay both enjoyable and scientifically 
rewarding.

Welcome to Stockholm in 1995!
