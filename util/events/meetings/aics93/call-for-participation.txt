Dear Colleague:
 
You are cordially invited to participate in The Fifth Workshop on
Architectures for Intelligent Control Systems AICS-93 which will be held
on August 25, 1993 at the Knickerbocker Hotel, Chicago, Illinois, USA,
in association with the 8th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent
Control.
 
This Workshop is planned to extend the discussions held at previous
Workshops in Aberdeen, Arlington, Nice, and Haifa. It will address the
issues raised in the discussion on the AICS-L listserv group and will more
extensively define the solutions and techniques applied in the area of
Architectures for Intelligent Control Systems.
 
The specific objectives of this Workshop are:
 
- to define the variety of existing approaches (centralized, distributed,
  and hybrid designs)
- to characterize their features (such as using analytical, AI, and schema-
  based methodologies)
- to identify pending problems (e.g., definition of a benchmark scenario,
  recommended techniques for comparative analysis, etc.)
- to determine the particular component and parameters of the architecture
  that are linked with the ability of intelligent control systems to learn.
 
The long term objectives of the workshop are:
 
- to stimulate development of new ideas concerning the Architectures for
  Intelligent Control Systems
- to develop a taxonomy of the knowledge domain related to Architectures for
  Intelligent Control Systems
- to discuss and continue to develop a glossary of common terms which
  describe the attributes of Architectures for Intelligent Control Systems
- to devise prepective methods and measures by which to evaluate and compare
  the performance of Architectures for Intelligent Control Systems
- to focus the research and engineering efforts on the area of
  Architectures for Intelligent Control Systems.
 
The following topics will be addressed:
 
- structures of control ingrained within architectures,
- their distribution within the architectures,
- techniques for functional decomposition,
- methods of mapping functions into the architectural components,
- methods and tools for design, implementation, and testing,
- evaluation and comparison of the architectures
