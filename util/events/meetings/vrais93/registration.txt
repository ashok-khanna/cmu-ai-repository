VIRTUAL REALITY ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM 1993
 
Sheraton Hotel & Towers
Seattle, Washington 
U.S.A.
September 18-22, 1993
 
The Virtual Reality Technical Committee of the IEEE Neural Networks
Council cordially invites you to attend the First Virtual Reality
Annual International Symposium.
 
Virtual Reality has grown in recent years into an active, highly
interdisciplinary field of research, development, and applications
prototyping.  It goes by several names including virtual environments,
virtual worlds, artificial reality, and advanced computer-human
interfaces.  Whatever it is called, there exist many challenges to be
overcome in science, engineering, and technology development before
the vision of virtual reality can be reached.
 
The goal of this conference is to bring together workers in the many
diverse technical disciplines contributing to this field and provide a
forum for the interchange of timely, quality theories; experimental
results; and technological developments.  We encourage you and your
colleagues to actively participate in this first IEEE conference in
virtual reality science and technology.
 
The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Neural Networks Council and
cosponsored by nearly every IEEE society there is.

Seattle's heart.  Nearby is almost every major urban attraction in the
city, including the Space Needle and Pacific Science Center, the world
famous Pike Place Public Market, and the ferries to the legendary
islands of Puget Sound.  Vancouver, BC, Seattle's sister city, is only
three hours north by automobile; Portland, Oregon, is three hours
south.  The Olympic Peninsula, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Rainer are each
within an hour's drive.

For VRAIS registrants, room rates are $118 (single) and $138 (double).
Deadline for Hotel reservations is AUGUST 1, 1993.
 
American Airlines has waived restrictions and thus permitted many
registrants to fly with SuperSaver fares.  The official travel agency
of the VRAIS is Bristol Travel, +1-800-762- 2746 or +1-714-285-1145.
During off-hours, U.S. residents can call +1-800-237-7980 and use
reference number SY2CO for preferential service.
 
There are tours available for spouses and families to Snoqualmie Falls
("Twin Peaks"), all around Puget Sound by boat, and Boeing's state-of-
the-art factories and technical center.
