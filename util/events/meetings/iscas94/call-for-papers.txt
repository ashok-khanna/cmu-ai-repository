                       IEEE ISCAS'94

        International Symposium on Circuits and Systems

          30th May - 2nd June 1994, London, England

                     CALL FOR PAPERS

        Deadline for submission: 1 October 1993

ISCAS '94 will take place in the New Connaught Rooms conveniently located
in the Covent Garden area in London's West End.  From here it's easy to
walk to lots of cafes, bars, restaurants, theatres, shops, hotels and
historic sites.

ACCOMMODATION
High quality but inexpensive hotel accommodation within easy walking
distance of the conference venue has been reserved for delegates.

TECHNICAL PROGRAMME
All the topics normally associated with ISCAS will be addressed by talks
and posters as well as by keynote speakers, "birds-of-a-feather" meetings
and a plenary session.  Paper presentations will be grouped into eight
'tracks' - Communications and Visual Signal Processing, Linear Circuits and
Systems, Analogue Signal Processing, Digital Signal Processing, VLSI,
Computer-Aided Design, Neural Systems and Nonlinear Circuits and Systems.

INFORMATIONS TO AUTHORS
Authors are invited to submit SIX (6) copies of an EXTENDED SUMMARY (at
least 2000 words) of their paper to Professor J.I. SEWELL, Dept. of
Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12
8LT, UK to arrive by 1 October 1993.  Your work should be clearly
described, its significance explained, novel features identified and
references given to prior work.

Author name(s), address, telephone/fax/telex numbers and email address
should be on a separate sheet which will be removed during the review to
ensure anonymity.  Authors should indicate the technical track (see under
Technical Programme) under which the paper should be reviewed, and the
preferred presentation format - lecture or poster.
