                                                Ms.  Gabrielle Aldridge


We invite authors to submit papers describing both experimental and
theoretical results from all stages of AI research.  In particular, we
encourage submission of papers that describe innovative concepts,
techniques, perspectives, or observations that are not yet supported by
mature results. Such submissions must include substantial analysis of the
ideas, the technology needed to realise them, and their potential impact.
Papers describing applied AI are particularly solicited.  In addition,
because of the essential interdisciplinary nature of AI and the need to
maintain effective communication across sub-specialties, we encourage
authors to position and motivate their work in the larger context of the
general AI community.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Machine Learning                            Knowledge Acquisition
Natural Language Processing                 Natural Language Understanding
Hybrid Systems                              Genetic Algorithms
Evolutionary Programming                    Knowledge Based Systems
Knowledge Representation                    Qualitative Reasoning
Automated Reasoning                         Planning and Scheduling
Cognitive Modelling                         Robotics
Vision                                      Distributed Artificial Intelligence
Neural Network                              Image Analysis

Authors are invited to submit complete, original papers in the format
specified below, reflecting their current research results. All submitted
papers will be refereed for quality and originality. The program committee
reserves the right to accept submissions as either technical or poster
presentation paper. Authors must submit five (5) copies of the completed
paper to the AI'94 Conference Secretary at the following address by 15th.
June 1994.

reported?  Does it attack an important/difficult problem or a
peripheral/simple one?  Does the approach offered advance the state of the
art? Has this or similar work been previously reported?  Are the problems
and approaches completely new?  Is this a novel combination of familiar
techniques?  Does the paper point out differences from related research? Is
it re-inventing the wheel using new terminology? Is the paper technically
sound?  Does it carefully evaluate the strengths and limitations of its
contribution?  How are its claims backed up? Is the paper clearly written?
Does it motivate the research? Does it describe the inputs, outputs and
basic algorithms employed?  Does the paper describe previous work? Are the
results described and evaluated? Is the paper organised in a logical
fashion?

There are three Keynote addresses from renowned international speakers.   
Professor Wolfgang Wahlster from the German Research  Centre for AI (DFKI) 
will address  "Intellimedia: Planning Language, Graphics and Layout for 
Adaptive Information Presentation".  He is a AAAI Fellow and served as the 
Conference Chair for IJCAI-93 in Chambery and the Chair of the Board of 
Trustees of IJCAII from 1991 -1993. Professor Katia Sycara from Carnegie 
Mellon University (CMU) will address "The Present and Future of 
Distributed Artificial Intelligence". She is well known for her work on 
distributed artificial intelligence and integration of case-based 
reasoning with other problem solving methods.  Professor John F. Sowa from 
State University of New York - Binghamton will address "Sharing and 
Integrating Knowledge Bases".  He is the author of the book "Conceptual 
Structures", which in the past ten years has led to a world-wide movement 
of  people who are using, implementing, and extending the theory of 
conceptual  graphs.   

These three keynote speakers will also attend the postgraduate session to 
discuss various AI problems with attendants.  We are sure that your 
attendance will benefit both AI'94 and yourself.
 
 We are looking forward to meeting you in Armidale in November 1994.

TRAVEL

International:  Overseas delegates are reminded that most visitors to 
	Australia will need a visa for entry.  It is the delegates 
	responsibility to check  with their local travel agent or 
	Australian consulate as to how to arrange for the visa.

Domestic Airlines: Ansett  has been appointed the official carrier for 
	all domestic air travel. When making booking arrangements delegates 
	should quote the following masterfile number: MC01523
	Group discounts of 35% off the regular fare is also available. 
	To contact the nearest Ansett Travel Consultant ring:  13 14 13  
	from anywhere in Australia

Sydney - Armidale: Ansett Airlines do not fly direct to Armidale.  As a 
	consequence, a seperate conference code is required for 
	Hazelton's Airlines: YO CONF 15
	(Quoting the above code will entitle you to 15% discount off the 
	regular full airfare.)

Road: Armidale is located on the New England Highway (No.15) and all 
	major bus companies have a service which passes through Armidale.  
	Alternatively delegates may choose to drive from either Sydney or 
	Brisbane. Typically it is a 6.5 hours car trip from Sydney or 
	5.5 hours by car from Brisbane.

Rail: Armidale is serviced by the NSW Railways and is located at the 
	Northern End of the Explorer Rail Service.

To and from the Conference: There is a single bus company which runs a 
	bus service between the centre of town and the University. The 
	cost for a one way trip is $1.50.  Due to the limited route of 
	the buses Taxi is the only other public transport available. On 
	average you can expect to pay approximately $10 from the motels 
	listed below to the University.  


ACCOMMODATION BOOKINGS

The organising committee has obtained a bed, breakfast package for $43 
per night for conference participants who choose to stay at Mary White 
College (MWC). MWC is located only 2 mins walk from all conference 
venues. The organising committee believes that the accommodation at MWC
offers the best value for delegates attending the conference.  MWC college 
offers a typical college style accommodation with a single study bedroom, 
telephone, linen, towels and shared bathroom facilities. As added 
incentive the College has agreed to provide evening meals for those people 
staying at MWC on Wednesday Night and for students on Thursday night. 
Delegates wishing to stay at MWC are asked to pay for their accommodation
in advance along with their registration to AI'94.

The Organising Committee understands that a college type of accommodation is 
not suitable for or desirable for all delegates and so has included a 
list of alternate accommodation possibilities. Accommodation providers 
which provide some evening meals are also marked.  Prices and Ratings 
listed are taken from the NRMA Accommodation guide and are provided only
as an indication to the price of a double room and standard of the 
accommodation available. The organising committee will book 
accommodation of your choice where possible but it will be the 
responsibility of the delegate to pay for thier accommodation on 
departure. 


CONFIRMATION OF BOOKINGS

Registration forms and fees will be acknowledged and MWC accommodation 
bookings confirmed, as they are received. Please check the confirmation 
letter and advise of any changes immediately.

ABSTRACT

Many topics in AI became fashionable and then disappeared again.
Constraint-based reasoning is certainly an exception to this. Started
in the early seventies with algorithms like the well-known Waltz
algorithm, the interest in constraint-based reasoning has increased
during the successive years, involving researchers from different
areas and with different backgrounds.

Constraint-based reasoning is applied in a variety of applications. To
name a few examples: A project group at the University of Hamburg
recently developed a constraint-based system for planning the cabin
layout of the newest version of the Airbus (which is considered to be
one of the most advanced civil aircrafts currently available).
Researchers from NASA recently published their work on a
constraint-based system for scheduling observations using the Hubble
Space Telescope.  Ascent Technology, Inc., developed the
constraint-based system ARIS (Airport Resource Information System),
which is used by Delta Airlines to help allocate airport gates to
arriving flights.


DETAILED PLAN

This tutorial will give an introduction to the main concepts and
techniques of constraint-based reasoning. It is divided into a lecture
and a practical part. The latter involves some programming using a
toolbox of constraint satisfaction algorithms written in C. The
lecture is structured as follows:

   1. Motivation for the tutorial and a general introduction to
      constraint-based reasoning.

   2. Presentation of a demo domain for constraint-based reasoning:
      reasoning about the spatial relationships among items in a
      typical office.

   3. Introduction of a general framework for constraint-based
      reasoning.

   4. Overspecified constraint satisfaction problems: a real-world
      problem.

   5. General techniques for constraint-based reasoning: from local
      consistency algorithms to backtracking with heuristics.

   6. Constraint-based reasoning on parallel and massively parallel
      computers.

   7. Constraint satisfaction as an optimization problem.

   8. Some applications of constraint-based reasoning.

   9. Summary of the main concepts and conclusion.


Recommended reading material is:

   H.W. Guesgen and J. Hertzberg.
   A Perspective of Constraint-Based Reasoning.

BIO-DATA OF THE PRESENTER

The presenter is a lecturer at the Computer Science Department of the University
of Auckland, New Zealand, where he is teaching introductory and advance courses on AI.

He is co-chairing the Workshop on Constraint Processing to be held in 
connection with the 1994 European Conference on Artificial Intelligence 
(ECAI-94) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Together with Joachim Hertzberg from 
the GMD in St. Augustin, Germany, he presented tutorials on constraint-based 
reasoning at the British AI conference in 1991 (AISB-91) and at the German AI 
conference in 1991 (GWAI-91).  He is the author/coauthor of two books on 
constraint-based reasoning, and has more than 30 publications in books, 
journals, and conference proceedings.

INTRODUCTION

Evolutionary computation is the study of computational systems which use ideas
and get inspirations from natural evolution. This full-day tutorial will give 
a practical introduction to genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming and 
evolution strategies and present a brief overview of the whole field of
evolutionary computation.

 AI'94 Tutorial on Knowledge Acquisition and Maintenance with Ripple Down Rules

GOALS

The aim of this tutorial is to teach participants a simple but powerful
knowledge acquisition (KA) technique for building knowledge based systems
(KBS), Ripple Down Rules (RDR).  

The problems in KA arise partly because of our naive cultural expectations
as to what an expert is capable of providing.  The tutorial will encourage
participants to a critical view as to what knowledge acquisition is about
and provide a standpoint for understanding and evaluating KA solutions
proposed by current research.  

RDR will be proposed as a partial solution to the KA problem.  It is
intended that the tutorial will leave participants with a sufficiently
detailed understanding of RDR, its strengths and limitations, so that
without further KBS background they will be able apply RDR to building KBS.

It is intended that,  assuming reasonable programming skills, participants
will be able to build their own RDR interpreters, adapt existing expert
system shells to use RDR, or extend existing information systems to include
RDR, if desired.  It will be possible to present the algorithms involved in
sufficient detail for this because of their simplicity.  However, no prior
experience will be assumed and participants will be provided with RDR
software sufficient to build reasonably large systems.

Finally it would be hoped that participants would get a clear idea of the
limitations of RDR and perhaps be encouraged to explore solutions to these
problems.


BACKGROUND

The first major problem in the successful development of a KBS is the
choice of an application.  Assuming the application is suitable, to build a
significant KBS requires considerable effort, particularly in acquiring and
maintaining the expert knowledge needed by the system.   This has been
described as the "knowledge engineering bottleneck".  The essential problem
in KA is that experts never explain how they reach a conclusion, rather
they justify that their conclusion is correct.  This justification depends
on the context in which it is given, whether the person for whom the
justification is intended is a lay person, a trainee and expert etc.  That
is, knowledge is always "situated" in a context.  Further, it is not part
of an expert's normal skill to be able tocategorise and describe the type
of problem solving they carry out.  

Most current research aims at setting up methodologies to approach these
problems in a disciplined and careful way.  Such methods, in common with
conventional software engineering techniques, are powerful, interesting,
have wide applicability, but require sophisticated practitioners.   Ripple
Down Rules is knowledge acquisition methodology which assumes that since
knowledge is given only in a specific context it should be used only in the
same context.  This leads to an approach to building KBS by incremental
refinement covering maintenance as well as initial development.  It also
allows the knowledge being added to be easily validated.  This approach has
a number of consequences.  

Firstly, RDR allow experts to build KBS without any knowledge engineering
or programming assistance or training.  This has been demonstrated in the
PEIRS system at St.Vincent's Hospital Sydney.  This systems provides
interpretative comments for diagnostic pathology laboratory reports.  It
currently has over 2000 rules and is 95% correct in the domains it covers.
It would seem to be one of the largest medical systems in actual routine
use.  It also seems to be the only large system in use built without a
knowledge engineer (or without induction).  Importantly it was put into
routine use with only 200 rules and all other knowledge has been added
while the system has been in use as a minor extension to  the expert's
normal duties.

Secondly, RDR blur the distinction between maintenance and initial
development.  The cost of adding a rule with an RDR system is the same
regardless of how large the system is and how long it has been under
development.  The issue of loss of expertise and the difficulty of dealing
with a large structure built by someone else does not arise in the
incremental approach used with RDR.  

Thirdly RDR seem to be the first practical approach to KBS based on a
situated cognition perspective.  Situated cognition is increasingly the
basis of a critique of traditional  approaches to AI.  RDR eschew the
notion that it is necessary to search for the best or right way of
constructing a KB.  Rather knowledge is constructed in context as a
consequence of applying insight to a concrete problem.  RDR thus emphasise
test and repair rather than problem solving and domain analyss.

RDR do not immediately solve all problems and have their own intrinsic
problems.  The most important problem is that the KB may contain repeated
knowledge acquired through repeated KA of the same knowledge.   Brian
Gaines (University of Calgary) has developed an inductive method of
building or compressing an RDR KB which will be described in detail. 
However it has also been shown that this is minor rather than major problem
(PEIRS has not yet been compressed).  Secondly, RDR were developed for
applications where a single classification is required and all the data are
available before inference. Extensions to RDR to deal with multiple
classifications and problems such as configuration will be described. 
Participants should expect to gain some insight into how these problems can
be dealt with, but the major focus of the tutorial will be on standard
single classification RDR.  Finally, the development of  domain models and
suitable data abstraction for RDR will be discussed.

TUTORIAL MATERIALS

Participants will be provided with notes and/or copies of key papers on RDR
and a demonstration program for Apple Macintosh or Windows on a PC.  The
demonstration programs are stand alone and will enable participants to
build significant RDR systems.  Their best use however will be as a
demonstration program as RDR are best used embedded within an information
system.  The software will be demonstrated during the tutorial.  It is not
necessary for participants to bring a portable Macintosh or PC to the
tutorial, but it will facilitate participation.


BIO-DATA OF THE PRESENTER

Paul Compton is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer  Science
and Engineering, University of New South Wales.  Before coming to UNSW in
1990, he was Head of Computing Services at the Garvan Institute of Medical
Research, Sydney.  Together with Kim Horn and Ross Quinlan he was
responsible for GARVAN-ES1 one of the first medical expert systems to reach
routine use.  This system is also one of the very few examples of KBS
maintenance as it was continuously maintained over five years.  RDR grew
out of this maintenance experience. He is a member of the editorial board
of the Knowledge Acquisition Journal, has been on the organising committee
of various international Knowledge Acquisition Workshops and is a co-chair
of the Japanese Knowledge Acquisition Workshop later this year.

   AI'94 Tutorial on Fundamentals of Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Logic Controllers

                                    by

                      A. Sekercioglu and G. K. Egan

                     Swinburne University of Technology       
                            {yas,gke}@swin.oz.au

                               22 November 1994


OVERVIEW

Fuzzy logic, along with artificial neural networks and genetic
algorithms constitutes a part of computational intelligence which, in
recent years, has become a focal point of research. It attempts to
model and mathematically encapsulate the approximate reasoning
processes under the influence of imprecise, incomplete and vague input
data. Fuzzy logic has strengths in modelling highly nonlinear,
complex sytems which are commonly  encountered in product design,
manufacturing and control.

One application of fuzzy logic, control systems utilizing some of its
concepts has become an important engineering tool. This tutorial
presents a comprehensive picture of fundamental issues of fuzzy logic
in order to study the structure and operation of fuzzy logic
controllers.


DETAILED PLAN

The tutorial will address these issues:

        * introduction and approaches to system modeling: comparison
	  of explicit, neural and fuzzy modeling methods,

	* crisp sets and fuzzy sets, basic concepts,

	* operations on fuzzy sets, t-norms and t-conorms,

	* fuzzy relations and composition of fuzzy relations,

	* fuzzy inference, generalized modus ponens, generalized modus 
	  tollens, fuzzy implication functions,

	* a brief look at intelligent control, 

	* fuzzy logic controllers: operation and examples.

Towards the end of the tutorial, a laboratory session is organized. In the 
laboratory session, participants will be able to test their ideas by writing 
their fuzzy rule bases for a simulated fuzzy logic controller in the  UNIX 
environment.

PREREQUISITES
 
This tutorial will present both introductory and in-depth material.
So, it will be suitable for both to novices, as well as to those with
some background who wish to extend their knowledge in the area of
fuzzy logic controllers. No prerequisite knowledge of the field is
necessary. However, some background in propositional logic and
classical set theory would be helpful.

ABSTRACT

The current development of knowledge engineering brings to use very powerful 
methods for representing and dealing with raw data, incomplete or imprecise 
data and knowledge, uncertainty, common sense knowledge, complex systems. And 
these are the connectionist methods, the methods of fuzzy logic and the chaos 
theory, which complement the existing AI symbolic methods. What are the main 
principles of the symbolic AI methods, the connectionist methods, the methods 
of fuzzy systems and chaos theory and how can one use if necessary, all of them 
when creating an information system? This is the main theme of the tutorial. 

First, the main principles of using symbolic, fuzzy and neuro systems for 
problem solving will be discussed and compared. Then hybrid systems will be 
introduced. A hybrid symbolic-fuzzy-neural environment will be used for 
demonstration and practical examples will be given as illustrations. Different 
techniques for solving difficult problems in a hybrid environment will be 
demonstrated.  Connectionist and fuzzy systems can compliment each other very 
well. How to use neural networks for learning fuzzy rules and how to implement 
fuzzy rules in a connectionist structure will also be discussed. A picture on 
the current development of fuzzy neurons and fuzzy neural networks will be 
given. 

Another topic presented in the tutorial is chaos theory. Chaos theory has 
tremendous potential in many areas. It is not only about the infinite variety 
of `patterns' which can be generated by using a chaotic function with a lot of 
practical applications, but it is also the way we can simulate or approximate 
complex real systems. Chaotic neurons and chaotic neural networks will be 
presented with some of their applications. 

Having different techniques implemented in one hybrid environment facilitates 
creating more powerful information processing systems than any of its 
components. So, the main advantage of using hybrid systems is that they have 
all the advantages of their subsystems which make them very powerful tools 
especially for solving AI problems.

ABSTRACT

This tutorial will demonstrate how attendees can move beyond using rule 
based reasoning to build intelligent decision support systems.  In this 
tutorial we focus upon supplementing deductive reasoning with case based 
reasoning, neural networks and intelligent information retrieval.  Applications 
of these principles in law, management and finance will be provided.

The tutorial will provide background knowledge necessary to understand the 
lectures of Professor Sowa and Sycara.


OUTLINE OF THE TUTORIAL

*	Introduction 
	- The need for intelligent decision support systems in finance, 
          management and law

*	Strategies for providing Intelligent Decision Support Systems 
        - Intelligent Information Retrieval, Deductive Reasoning, Case Based 
          Reasoning

* 	Intelligent Information Retrieval 
        - Keyword retrieval, Boolean retrieval, Vector space models,
          Probabilistic models.

*	Introduction to deductive reasoning systems 
	- Production rule systems, Logic programming approaches,
          Object oriented approaches.

*	Case based reasoning systems 
	- What are based reasoners? Why use case based reasoners? 
	  Constructing differing types of case based reasoners. Examples of 
          case based reasoners: MEDIATOR, PERSUADER, CASEY, HYPO, PROTOS 
          Automated design of case bases.

*	Integrating deductive and case based reasoning 
	- Using the object oriented approach to build integrated systems. 
	  The relative benefits and disadvantages of blackboard systems and 
	  distributed artificial intelligence to build integrated systems. 
	  Examples of integrated systems: ANAPRON, CABARET, GREBE, IKBALS, 
          PROLEXS

*	Combining information retrieval, deductive reasoning, neural networks 
	and case based reasoning 
	- Conceptual information retrieval and neural networks, Bayesian 
          Inference Networks, hypertext, The DATALEX workstation, AIR and 
          SCALIR, WIN (Westlaw Is Natural), SPLIT UP.

*	Conclusion


ASSOCIATED PRACTICAL WORK

There will be two practical components in the tutorial

     Participants will have the opportunity to examine and use integrated
     systems built by the tutorial presenters: in particular IKBALS and
     FLORENCE -- integrated rule based/case based reasoners -- and SPLIT-UP
     an integrated rule based/neural network system.

     Participants will build legal knowledge based systems under the 
     guidance of the tutorial presenters. They will have the opportunity to
     examine how to supplement rule based reasoning with one or more of the 
     reasoning and retrieval approaches discussed in the tutorial.

ABSTRACT

Knowledge acquisition from databases is a research frontier for both database
technology and machine learning (ML) techniques, and has seen sustained
research over recent years.  It also acts as a link between the two fields,
thus offering a dual benefit.  Firstly, since database technology has already
found wide application in many fields, ML research obviously stands to gain
from this greater exposure and established technological foundation. Secondly,
ML techniques can augment the ability of existing database systems to
represent, acquire, and process a collection of expertise such as those which
form part of the semantics of many advanced applications (e.g. CAD/CAM). This
full-day tutorial will present and discuss techniques for the following 3
interconnected phases in constructing intelligent learning database systems:
(1) Translation of standard database information into a form suitable for use
by a rule-based system; (2) Using machine learning techniques to produce rule
bases from databases; and (3) Interpreting the rules produced to solve users'
problems and/or reduce data spaces.  It will suit a wide audience (including
postgraduate students and industrial people) from databases, expert systems,
and machine learning.

ABSTRACT

Complete information is difficult to come by and generally not available
even in simple database applications. Consequently, an intelligent
reasoning system must be capable of making plausible conjectures, which
may be retracted when found to be incorrect according to new information
that becomes available. Nonmonotonic Reasoning provides a mechanism for an
intelligent reasoning system to make such conjectures when its knowledge
is incomplete;  this is accomplished by sanctioning inferences by default
or by determining those that are most likely according to some criteria. 

The tutorial will consist of a theoretical and a practical component.  In
the theoretical component we aim to provide a conceptual framework for
Nonmonotonic Reasoning. Rather than discussing a very broad set of topics,
we will focus on one of the main approaches to Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
namely default logic.  In particular, we will focus on how one can
represent problems and how one may determine extensions within the default
logic formalism.  In practice, determining extensions is one of the main
obstacles when implementing and applying default logic, and is very often
neglected in tutorials, courses, and even books.  The practical component
comprises the hands-on development of an example whose purpose is to
illustrate the utility of Nonmonotonic Reasoning. 

Participants will obtain an appreciation of some methods in the field of
Nonmonotonic Reasoning, and will also explore tools and techniques which
are very useful in practice.

ABSTRACT

The act of learning is one of the most important hallmarks of what 
it means to  be intelligent  and  most AI  systems  are  far from  
exhibiting this property. Realization of this deficiency in expert 
systems  has  caused learning  to become  a central  issue  in AI  
today.   Herbert Simon, in his  keynote  address  at last year's
AAAI, noted that Machine Learning will increasingly  take  center
stage  in  AI throughout the next decade.  Most future AI systems
will need some ability to learn and to adapt to changes in  their
environments unforeseen by the system developers.

Machine Learning certainly is one of the hardest problems  in  AI
today.  Despite considerable progress, it can be argued that some
approaches to Machine Learning are  still  practiced  as  ``black
art.''   Sometimes  a  learning  algorithm  achieves  astonishing
results; and yet at other times they perform so poorly  that  the
user  ends  up  tinkering  with the system without any reasonable
return for their effort.

Fundamental investigations into the problems  and  challenges  of
Machine  Learning have been conducted in Philosophy for ages, and
more recently such studies have also been conducted  in  Computer
Science.

GOALS OF THE TUTORIAL

1. To clearly  lay down the central conceptual ingredients  of  a
learning   framework.    These   ingredients   are   not  clearly
distinguished in many practical approaches.  

2. An introduction to the mathematical analysis of learning  tasks  
and  the  basic techniques  of  Computational  Learning  Theory.   

3. The  interplay between  learning  algorithm,  training  data, 
computing time and success criteria will be explored.

DETAILED PLAN 
1. Computational Limitations on Learning         
   1.1 Learnability from  positive  data.          
   1.2 Learnability from positive and negative data.          
   1.3 Batch and Incremental  Learning.   
2. Heuristics   for   Learning           
   2.1 Monotonic  Heuristics.
   2.2 Consistent and  Inconsistent  Heuristics          
   2.3 Pattern   Languages.    
3. Resource  Requirements  for  Learning
   3.1 Introduction to probably approximately correct learning          
   3.2 Bounds on required number  of  training examples.           
   3.3 Computational  Complexity of Learning Tasks.          
   3.4 Analysis of Neural Network's Learning Power.

COURSE MATERIAL:

Lecture notes and bibliographical references will be provided for
every participant.
