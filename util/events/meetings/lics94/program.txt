REGISTRATION
============
The registration form should be sent to the conference
office. Registration without payment (or purchase order) enclosed will
not be considered.  For early registration, payment must be received
by June 5.  Fees will be returned in full for any written cancellation
received before June 24. No refund will be made after this date.

A table of registration fees can be found on the registration form.
The member rate applies to members of ACM, IEEE, EATCS and INRIA,
members of the organizing and program committees and authors of
accepted papers.  The student rate applies to full time students; a
copy of the registrant's 1993-94 student card should be included with
the registration form.

The registration fee includes conference participation, a copy of the
proceedings, coffee breaks and an invitation to the welcome reception.
There is a separate charge for the banquet.

Payment must be in French currency, and can be made by bank cheque,
postal cheque, or foreign draft made payable to "Agent Comptable de
l'INRIA", by bank transfer to Tresorerie Generale des
Yvelines, Versailles, account number 10071-78000-00044009 15389, by

this possibility by May 1. Participants wishing to use this facility
should contact our office at that time, preferably by email addressed
to symposia@inria.fr.  Bank transfers should specify registrant's name

There are two categories of hotels available, as well as inexpensive
student lodging (no age limit) in an international center in Clichy
(north Paris).  Paris is very popular in the summer, so reservations
should be made as soon as possible.

A deposit is compulsory for hotel reservations, and student lodging
must be entirely prepaid.  Payment must be in French currency, and can
be made by bank cheque, Eurocheque, or foreign draft made payable to
"Wagonlit Travel", by bank transfer to the account 00021935201/61

"Wagonlit Travel---code comptable 04/670", or by credit card.  Hotel
deposits will be forwarded to the hotel less 60FF for reservation
fees.  The participant's bank charges must be added to the amount
transferred.

For cancellations made before June 1, payments will be refunded less
60FF for fees; no refunds will be made after June 1.


LOCATION
========
The Conference is being hosted by the Conservatoire National des Arts
et Metiers (CNAM) and will be part of its Bicentennial celebration.
CNAM is a well-known engineering school where professionals are taught
by professionals.  It houses the famous Musee National Des Arts et
Techniques, and is located at 292 Rue Saint Martin in the old center
of Paris, on the right bank of the river Seine.  It is walking
distance from Les Halles, the Centre National d'Art et de Culture
Georges-Pompidou (Beaubourg), the Hotel de Ville (City Hall) and the
cathedral Notre-Dame de Paris.  The nearest Metro station is Arts et
Metiers.

Paris normally enjoys pleasant summer weather in early July.  Days are
warm, but nights may be cool.  For general information on Paris,
contact the Paris Tourist Information Office, 127 Champs Elysees,
75008 Paris, phone number 33 (1) 49 52 53 54.


RECEPTIONS
==========
A Welcome Reception will be held on Sunday evening (17:00-19:00) in a
gallery of CNAM.  The Conference Banquet will be held in the palace
housing the Senate, the upper chamber of the French Parliament.  The
palace was built in the beginning of the 17th century for Marie de
Medicis, widow of King Henry IV.  It is located in the well-known
Jardins du Luxembourg.  To reserve a place at the banquet, the
appropriate column on the registration form must be marked; a banquet
reservation on site will not be possible.


LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS
================== 
Lunches are at the participants' own expense.  Participants may eat in
cafes and restaurants in CNAM's vicinity.  Telephone messages will be
delivered to participants during breaks.  Access to email will be
possible from CNAM.

The organizers cannot be held liable to conference participants for
injury, damage or loss of their personal property. It is suggested
that participants make their own insurance arrangements.


REGISTRATION DESK
=================
A registration and information desk located at the conference site
will operate on Sunday, July 3, from 15:00 to 18:00, and on the
remaining conference days from 8:00 to 18:00.


TRAVEL
======
Paris has two airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle, 30km north of
Paris, and Orly, 20km south of Paris.  A frequent Air France bus
service goes from Roissy to Place Charles de Gaulle-Etoile or Porte
Maillot in central Paris (the cost is about 48FF); from Orly the bus
goes to Invalides and stops on demand at Montparnasse (32FF).  There
is also train service.  From Roissy, the RER B line goes to Gare du
Nord or Chatelet; from Orly, the Orlyval goes to Antony where there
is a connection to the RER B (32FF).  A taxi from Orly to central
Paris costs about 150FF; from Roissy, 200FF.

The Metro offers a convenient way to get around the city.  Each trip
(with unlimited transfers) costs one ticket.  Tickets can be bought
individually, but a carnet of 10 is more practical.  RER lines
to the suburbs connect with the Metro and cost more.  Both Metro
and RER tickets can be purchased from ticket booths or machines.

A 40-45% discount may be obtained from AIR INTER for French domestic
blue and white flights, depending on the days of departure.  A voucher
can be requested on the registration form.

Participants requiring a visa for entry into France are strongly
advised to make their application in their home countries at least two
months prior to departure date.
