                    Ninth Annual IEEE Symposium on
                      LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
                    July 4-7, 1994, Paris, France

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

The LICS Symposium aims to attract high quality original papers covering
theoretical and practical issues in computer science that relate to logic in 
a broad sense, including algebraic, categorical and topological approaches.

Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:
abstract data types, automated deduction, concurrency, constructive
mathematics, data base theory, finite model theory, knowledge representation, 
lambda and combinatory calculi, logical aspects of computational complexity, 
logics in artificial intelligence, logic programming, modal and temporal 
logics, program logic and semantics, rewrite rules, logical aspects of 
symbolic computing, problem solving environments, software specification, 
type systems, verification.

DATES:
	Submission deadline: December 13, 1993
	Notification: February 25, 1994
	Final papers due: April 15, 1994
	Conference: July 4-7, 1994

PAPER SUBMISSION: 
   10 hard copies of a detailed abstract (not a full paper) and 20 
   additional copies of the cover page should be received by 
   December 13, 1993 by the program chair.  This is a FIRM DEADLINE: 
   late submissions will not be considered.  Authors without access to 
   duplication facilities may submit a single copy of each.  Authors 
   will be notified of acceptance by February 25, 1994.  Accepted papers 
   (in a specified proceedings format) will be due April 15, 1994.

   The cover page of the submission should include the title, authors, 
   a brief synopsis, and the corresponding author's name, address, phone
   number, fax number, and e-mail address, when available.  Abstracts 
   must be in English, clearly written, and provide sufficient detail to 
   allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.  
   References and comparisons with related work should be included.  
   It is recommended that each submission begin with a succinct statement 
   of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation 
   of their significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased 
   for the non-specialist.  Technical development of the work, directed 
   to the specialist, should follow.  While abstracts of fewer than 1500 
   words are rarely adequate, the entire abstract should not exceed
   10 typed pages, with roughly 35 lines per page.  If the authors believe
   that more details are essential to substantiate their main results,
   they may place additional details in a clearly marked appendix.
   Submissions departing significantly from these guidelines run a high 
   risk of rejection.

   The results in the abstract must be unpublished, and not submitted
   for publication elsewhere, including proceedings of other symposia or
   workshops.  All authors of accepted papers will be expected to sign
   copyright release forms, and one author of each accepted paper will be
   expected to present the paper at the conference.

The symposium is sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee on Mathematical 
Foundations of Computing, in cooperation with the Association for 
Symbolic Logic and the European Association for Theoretical Computer 
Science.  The cooperation of the ACM is anticipated.  
The symposium is organized by INRIA, and hosted by the Conservatoire 
National des Arts et Metiers (CNAM) as part of its bicentennial.
Sponsorship by the CNRS and Universite d'Orsay is expected.
