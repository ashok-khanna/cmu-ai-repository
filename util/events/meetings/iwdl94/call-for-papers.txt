		     Announcement of the 
	1994 International Workshop on Description Logics

At the 1993 AAAI Fall Symposium on Description Logics it was decided to
have a workshop on description logics adjacent to KR-94.  The workshop will
be held at the Gustav Stresemann Institut in Bonn, Germany on 28 and 29 May
1994.  This is immediately after KR-94, and at the same site.  Costs for
attending the workshop including room and board at the institute will be
approximately 320DM.  The workshop will be limited to approximately 40
people.

If you are interested in attending the workshop please send a message to
the organizers stating your name, postal address, electronic mail address,
phone number, and fax number, in the format demonstrated below.  Please do
this as soon as possible (by 15 September at the latest) so we can make any
necessary modifications to the local arrangements.

Interested parties should prepare a short position paper on the subjects
they would like to discuss at the workshop.  (No more than 5 LaTeX
article-style pages.)   Subjects to be addressed could include the
following:

Applications of Description Logics, concentrating on what aspects of
description logics make them useful in the application;

Foundations of Description Logics, including complexity and decidability
results, semantics, and integration with other formalisms (such as
constraint logic programming);

Knowledge Representation Systems based on Description Logics, concentrating
on empirical results, novel algorithms, and implementation techniques;

Extensions to Description Logics, including, but not limited to, defaults,
queries, temporal reasoning, and constraints;

Uses of Description Logics in other areas, such as using them as query or
data definition languages in databases.

We are also planning on having some discussion of the ARPA Knowledge
Representation System Specification effort.

Please prepare a version of your position paper (preferably as a
self-contained LaTeX 12-point article style file) and send it to us
(preferably by electronic mail) to arrive by 11 February 1994.  The
position paper should include references to your past work in the field.
We will determine participation in the workshop on or before 4 March 1994,
based on these preliminary position papers and past work.  Revised versions
of position paper should be sent to the organizers by 1 April 1994, and
will be distributed to participants (probably electronically).  A technical
report consisting of these revised versions will be produced after the
workshop, and made available to others in the field.
