WLP 94 - Deadline Postponed

Contributions keep arriving, but so are requests for more time. To give
everyone a fair chance, we decided to postpone the deadline for submissions
to July 29. The other dates remain as before. 

---------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------

The Gesellschaft fuer Logisches Programmieren GLP - a subsection of the
Association for Logic Programming ALP - the sections 1.1 and 1.2  of the
Gesellschaft fuer Informatik GI, and the Swiss Group for Artificial
Intelligence and Cognitive Science SGAICO invite you to participate at the

       10th Logic Programming Workshop
       -------------------------------

       University of Zurich
       --------------------

       5 - 7 October 1994
       ------------------

Logic programming originates from the discovery that a subset of predicate
logic can be given a procedural interpretation thus forming the basis for
logic programming languages like Prolog, its extensions and successors. The
unique features of logic programming make it especially attractive for many
applications in artificial intelligence, program development, databases,
processing of language, computer aided design, programming with constraints
etc.

The program of the Logic Programming Workshop will include three invited
lectures

       Francois Bry (LMU Munich), Logic without Model Theory
       Andreas Krall (TU Wien), Implementation Techniques for Prolog
       Nada Lavrac (IJS Ljubljana), Inductive Logic Programming

presentations of a selection of the submitted papers, poster sessions, and
demonstrations. The languages of the workshop will be German and English.

We invite you to submit contributions in German or English from all aspects
of logic programming. We will consider not only original papers, but also
reports of current research and of completed projects. All contributions
will be refereed and - if accepted - published in the proceedings of the
workshop. Poster sessions and demonstrations on Macintoshes and Sun
workstations can be arranged.

Your submission should be in the form of an extended abstract not exceeding
4 pages, and must clearly identify the name, address, and email address of
the responsible author.

Please send your contribution until 29 July by electronic mail (plain
ASCII, BinHex'ed MacWord, PostScript or LATEX) to fuchs@ifi.unizh.ch. Your
contribution will be forwarded to the members of the program committee. You
will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of your contribution by 15
August. Final versions of your contribution must be available by 15
September to be included in the proceedings of the workshop.
