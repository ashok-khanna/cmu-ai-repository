                              Seminar at the
                      University of Trondheim, Norway
                            19-20 November 1993

                 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION AND PRESENTATIONS

    =================================================================

GENERAL 
-------
We are organizing an open seminar at the University of Trondheim to discuss
the role of the knowledge level in current AI research and practice. There
are three invited speakers, and some open slots for others who want to
report on their work related to this issue. 

The aim of the seminar is to achieve a deeper understanding of the notion
of the knowledge level, its current usage, and its future role for research
and development in areas such as knowledge-based systems, cognitive
science, and behaviour-based robotics. 

Starting from the definition in Newell's 1982 paper, the seminar will
address the following issues:

- The Knowledge Level as Newell saw it, its definition, purpose and 
application. Developments from Newell's 1982 paper to his 1989 book
(Unified architectures of cognition), in which he reconfirms the knowledge
level as a system description level, and extends its role. 

- Evolvement of the knowledge level from its original idea into more  
'operationalized' and structured interpretations. Knowledge level modeling
has become an important means to analysis and design in areas such as
knowledge acquisition and intelligent architectures. This has lead to
structured analysis and design methodologies such as KADS, Components of
Expertise, Generic Tasks, Role Limiting Methods, etc. 

- Relations between the knowledge level and its realization at the symbol 
level. This may be generalized to relations between the knowledge level and
other system description levels in general, but the focus will be on issues
related to the difficult task of implementing (parts of) a conceptual and
intentional knowledge level model in a computer language. 

- The role of the knowledge level as a scientific tool for research in AI
and 
cognitive science.

- Tool support, both for performing knowledge level analysis, and for
assisting 
the transformation/reformulation into a symbol level model and a running 
target system. 
 
The focus will be on fundamental and principal issues related to the
knowledge level and its role. Descriptions of specific modeling methods and
techniques will not be a target in itself, but a means to exemplify the
more general issues. 

PROGRAM
-------
The three invited talks are:

* Walter Van de Velde, Free University of Brussels, Belgium:

"ISSUES ON KNOWLEDGE LEVEL MODELING"

Since its introduction in the early 80s the notion of knowledge level has
been an important catalizer of research in knowledge systems. This talk
discusses how it is being turned into a useful tool for the development of
knowledge systems and how the original and present interpretations can be
tied together again. It shows how the knowledge level changed our views on
what knowledge systems are and how the problems with first generation
expert systems might be overcome. Two other issues are discussed in some
more detail. The first one is the precise  methodological role of the
knowledge level. The second issue concerns the nature of knowledge level
theories of problem solving and its implications for next generation
architectures.

Dr. Walter Van de Velde is a research director at the Belgian National
Science Foundation and co-director of the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory of the Flemish Free University of Brussels (VUB) where he heads
the knowledge based systems group. His main research interests are second
generation expert systems, machine learning, and architectures for
intelligent behavior. 

* Jon Sticklen, Michigan State University, USA:

"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, TASK SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURES, AND THE KNOWLEDGE
LEVEL: THREE PERSPECTIVES ON THE SAME ELEPHANT "

Software engineering as a discipline aims at the goal of effective
construction and maintenance of software artifacts which accomplish
specified tasks. Task specific architectures as a sub-discipline of AI aims
at the goal of capturing expert problem solving in terms "natural" to the
problem. The Knowledge Level Hypothesis, as a much used but little
understood concept, lays a putative framework for describing a very high
level analysis for problem solving systems. 
As originally described, the KL is not a prescription for representation or
a 
methodology for system building, but rather is best understood as an
analytic tool for understanding the operation of knowledge systems. All
three - Software Engineering, TSAs, and the KL viewpoint - deal with
describing problem solving behavior. In this position paper, we will argue
that there is an emerging integration of SE, TSAs, and the KL viewpoint. We
will argue that the confluence of SE and the KL are in fact converging on a
(strongly augmented) TSA view. 

Dr. Jon Sticklen is Associate Professor of Computer Science and Director of
the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Michigan State University. Following
his Ph.D. studies at the Ohio State University, Dr. Sticklen joined the
faculty at MSU where he initiated an active research program in
knowledge-based systems. Sticklen's major research foci are in integrative
approaches to large grain task specific problem solving, function-based
reasoning, and the theory of knowledge-based systems. Sticklen and his
associates are currently engaged in a wide variety of domain projects
including the design and fabrication of polymer composite materials, the
modeling of landscape level ecological systems, and the development of
decision support software for managing production agriculture in the lower
Nile valley.

* Carl Gustaf Jansson, Stockholm University/KTH, Sweden:

"ONTOLOGICAL VARIETY AND SHIFTS, AND ITS IMPACT ON KNOWLEDGE LEVEL DESIGN "

For many applications, ontological issues are not considered. It is assumed
that representation and problem solving procedures in a system are based
upon conceptions of the domain which are shared among all users of the
system. This may be a realistic simplification in some cases, but for many
applications where aspects of help, explanation and tutoring have an
important role, a system must be able to cope with a variety of ontologies
and ontological shifts. The systematic handling of this kind of situation
will have a great impact on methods for knowledge level design. The purpose
of the talk is to argue for this thesis and illustrate the problems.
Examples will be taken from cosmology, heat transfer and programming
methodology. The research problems described are focused in a recently
started European Science Foundation program on Learning in Humans and
Machines.

Dr. Carl Gustaf Jansson is acting professor and deputy head of department
for Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. He is chairman of
the board for the Centre for Information Technology and Cognitive Science,
and scientific advisor at the Swedish Institute for Computer Science
(SICS). He currently heads a research group in Machine Learning and
supervises research students in knowledge-based systems design, intelligent
interfaces, and natural language processing.


We will also present ongoing research in our department related to the
seminar topic:

* Agnar Aamodt, University of Trondheim, Norway:

"KNOWLEDGE LEVEL MODELING AND THE SYMBOL LEVEL GAP"

Over the last few years we have seen significant advances in methods for
constructing conceptual, knowledge level models of system behaviour, as
well as in techniques for symbol level realizations of knowledge-based
systems. This has lead to increased focus on the transition between these
two modeling levels. Current methods tend to be strongly biased by a
top-down approach to knowledge modeling, without addressing iterative
aspects of modeling through sustained learning from experience. This talk
will outline the major problems involved,  present a framework for
combining top-down knowledge modeling with bottom-up machine learning, and
describe initial attempts to analyse the problems involved using a
knowledge-level analysis tool (Krest, based on the Components of Expertise
framework). It will further discuss the role of case-based reasoning as a
means to integrate initial knowledge modeling with sustained learning.

Dr. Agnar Aamodt is a senior researcher in the Department of Informatics,
University of Trondheim. His research is directed towards improved methods
for construction and maintenance of knowledge-based systems. It includes
work on knowledge acquisition and modeling, integrated problem solving and
learning architectures, and case-based reasoning. 

OPEN INVITATION AND PRACTICALITIES
----------------------------------
We hereby invite others who also would like to present their work to submit
a 1-2 page abstract. There will be room for another 5-6 presentations of
15-30 minutes length. We are planning to publish a book on knowledge level
modeling based on presentations at the seminar. Papers for the book should
be submitted after the seminar (date to be decided).

The seminar will be held at the University of Trondheim, College of Arts
and Science. The main part of the seminar will take place on Friday 19th of
November. On Saturday 20th we will have in-depth discussions of some of
Friday's topics. 

The seminar is informal, open to those interested, and free to attend. If
you want to contribute or attend, please send an email message stating so,
indicate whether you want to make a presentation, and include a few lines
stating your particular interest and/or work on issues related to knowledge
level modeling.
