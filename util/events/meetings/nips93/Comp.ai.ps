NIPS*93  MEETING PROGRAM and REGISTRATION REMINDER

The 1993 Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS*93) meeting is
the seventh meeting of an inter-disciplinary conference which brings
together neuroscientists, engineers, computer scientists, cognitive
scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in all aspects
of neural processing and computation.  There will be an afternoon of
tutorial presentations (Nov. 29), two and a half days of regular
meeting sessions (Nov. 30 - Dec. 2), and two days of focused workshops
at a nearby ski area (Dec. 3-4).
