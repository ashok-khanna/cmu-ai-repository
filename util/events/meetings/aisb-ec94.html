                            CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                   AISB WORKSHOP ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTING

                      April 11th (pm) - 13th (am), (2 days)
                           University of Leeds, UK


Organisers: Terry Fogarty - University of the West of England, Bristol
            Ray Paton - Liverpool University
            Nick Radcliffe - Edinburgh University
            Phil Husbands - Sussex University
            Colin Reeves - Coventry University
            Peter Fleming - Sheffield University
            Dave Corne - Edinburgh University

Abstract:   The purpose of the workshop is to give researchers active in the
            area of evolutionary computing in the UK an opportunity to present
            their work and have discussions on current developments in a
            relatively informal atmosphere at a low cost.  Abstracts of talks
            will be refereed by the committee and a program drawn up on the
            basis of those accepted. Papers will be bound and distributed to
            the participants at the beginning of the workshop. Contributions
            will be welcomed from researchers visiting the UK.

Subjects:   Genetic Algorithms, Classifier Systems, Genetic Programming,
            Evolutionary Strategies, Evolutionary Programming.

Papers:     Acceptance will be on the basis of abstracts of a maximum 1000
            words.  Places will be available for those submitting abstracts.
            Others who wish to attend should submit a summary of interests.

Timetable:  15th Jan 1994:   Last date for submission of abstracts
            15th Feb 1994:   Notification of accepted abstracts
            15th Mar 1994:   Full papers due.


Please send notification of interest, submissions, and general 
correspondence to workshop chair, Terry Fogarty.

 The Workshop on Evolutionary Computation is one of a group of six 
workshops and two tutorials occuring at Leeds University during April 
11th- 13th 1994, organised by the Society for the Study of Artificial
Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviiur (AISB). 

 The fact that many workshops are being held concurrently in the same
place will provide an opportunity for attendees at one workshop to meet
with those from other workshops during breaks and in the evenings. In some
instances, it is also possible for attendees to attend more than one event.
