Preliminary Call For Papers

The Ninth Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference (KBSE '94)

20 -- 23 September 1994
Monterey, California

The Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conferences provides a forum
for exchanging results and new ideas regarding the application of
knowledge-based techniques to software engineering.  Knowledge-based
tools typically rely on explicit representations of knowledge about
application domains, designs, processes, etc. and support the
application of these representations to software engineering
activities.

KBSE '94 invites contributions describing basic research, novel
applications, working systems, and experience with applying
knowledge-based techniques in support of software artifacts and
processes.  Authors should submit 5 copies of papers to the Program
Chair by 1 April 1994.  Papers should be limited to 5000 words,
full-page figures being counted as 300 words.  Each paper must include
a short abstract and list of keywords.  Proposals for panels,
demonstrations, and tutorials should also be sent to the Program Chair
by 1 April 1994.  Notifications of acceptance or rejection will be
sent by 1 June 1994.

Ten years ago Rome Laboratories (then called the Rome Air Development
Center) released a report prepared by a committee of distinguished
computer scientists that outlined a bold research program called the
``Knowledge-Based Software Assistant'' (KBSA).  The program envisioned
an integrated software development environment with knowledge-based
tools supporting all facets of the software lifecycle and project
management.  Significant advances have been made towards this goal
over the last decade.  This year's conference will feature discussions
of the KBSA vision by some of the original authors.
