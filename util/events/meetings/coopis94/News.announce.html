                                CALL FOR PAPERS

                       SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                         COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
                                  (CoopIS'94)
      Formerly "Intelligent & Cooperative Information Systems (ICICIS)"


                                May 17-20, 1994
                       Royal York Hotel, Toronto, Canada


      Supported by the Information Technology Research Centre of Ontario

                     Sponsored by the University of Toronto

       In cooperation with ACM SIGOIS and ACM SIGMOD (pending approval)



TSUNAMI - THE TIDAL WAVE IS HERE
--------------------------------

Within most organizations, worldwide, mission critical information systems
(ISs) already cooperate or are being converted to do so to meet basic
business requirements. Due to the lack of appropriate concepts, techniques,
and tools, this is being done using primitive means thereby creating
problems that will dwarf those of current legacy information systems. This
conference is devoted to addressing this tidal wave facing the information
systems community.



COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS: THE NEXT GENERATION AND THE CHALLENGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The paradigm for the next generation of ISs will involve large numbers of
ISs distributed over large, complex computer/communication networks. This
ranges from the vast and visionary Electronic Superhighway, to the large
and complex billing system of a telephone company, an even to the small
patient information system in a one-doctor office. Such ISs will manage or
have access to large amounts of information and computing services. They
will support individual or collaborative human work. Computation will be
conducted concurrently over the network by software systems that range from
conventional to advanced application systems including expert systems, and
multiagent planning systems. Information and services will be available in
many forms through legacy and new information repositories that support a
host of information services. Communication among component systems will be
done in a centralized or distributed fashion, using communication protocols
that range from conventional ones to those based on distributed AI. We call
such next generation ISs Cooperative Information Systems (CIS). Soon, the
operation of a one-doctor office may critically depend on its ISs' ability
to cooperate with foreign ISs not just for reimbursement (i.e., required by
insurance organizations) but also for patients (e.g., exchanging
information in medical crises). Demand for more efficient processes and use
of all resources will come from economic and business conditions (e.g.,
competition, imperative for wider marketplaces, and cooperation and
distribution in the production of goods and services) that have led to
downsizing and re-engineering . IS technology, one of the largest costs of
many organizations, can be the problem, or part of the solution. The
demands are pervasive from vast organizations to very small. The
requirements span conventional organizational and legal boundaries such as
countries, companies (e.g., virtual companies), disciplines (e.g.,
concurrent engineering spanning a products entire life span). The CIS
paradigm is evolving to meet these demands thus raising challenges for the
supporting technologies.

Unlike previous major computing advances based on single technologies, the
CIS paradigm will evolve from the integration of many, currently disjoint
technologies. Database Systems will contribute information management
techniques, particularly for distributed or heterogeneous databases, as
well as efficient implementation techniques for information bases.
Artificial Intelligence will contribute knowledge representation and
reasoning techniques, on the one hand, and distributed problem solving and
planning techniques in a multiagent environment on the other. Operating
Systems will contribute resource management techniques over large
distributed computer/communications networks. Programming Languages will
contribute languages and type/object systems for cooperative programming.
Software/Knowledge/Information Engineering will contribute design and
development environments/shells and methodologies for CIS development and
evolution. Computer Communications will provide the necessary underlying
communication and interconnection technology. Other relevant technologies
include: Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Distributed Computing,
Organizational Computing, and Interoperability. The challenge is to
effectively combine these technologies and their contributions to meet CIS
requirements. A significant challenge is to overcome the existing
boundaries to achieve a common understanding of the relevant issues.

CIS will become reality through research in concepts, methodologies,
techniques, and tools for the efficient - and transparent - integration of
computing resources that are accessible over large computer/communications
networks which may become indistinguishable from the CISs themselves. More
important is the technology transfer and communication required between the
significant, practical situations, which exemplify the requirements, and
the research community that tries to address them. But most important is an
increased common understanding across the existing boundaries as to the
nature of the problems, the requirements, and adequate approaches to
address them.



THE CONFERENCE
--------------

The CoopIS-94 conference will provide a forum for the presentation and
dissemination of this research covering all aspects of CIS conception,
requirements, functionality, implementation, deployment, and evolution.

The CoopIS-94 conference programme will include technical sessions, invited
presentations, panels, and tutorials that deal with CISs and the
integration of relevant technologies. In addition, CoopIS-94 plans to host
special sessions on the industrial applicability of CIS technology. Further
information about the conference and its programme can be obtained from the
General and Program Co-Chairs and by anonymous FTP from ftp.cs.toronto.edu
(128.100.1.105) under directory pub/coopis or by sending e-mail to
coopis@cs.toronto.edu.

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS
-----------------------

Authors must clearly relate the contribution of their work to the concept
of CIS, rather than just describing aspects of a component technology
(e.g., state assumptions or definitions as to the nature of CISs). Papers
which illustrate their results in terms of an CIS application or address
technology integration issues leading to CISs are particularly welcome.

Submission must be identified as one of three different categories:
visions, research, and experience. Vision papers should present stimulating
challenges, ideas, or visions that lead to exciting and valuable CIS
research directions. Vision papers will be evaluated with respect to
innovation, realizable applications and technologies, and technical
challenges posed (e.g., that do not currently admit of solutions). Research
papers should advance the state of the art of CIS and will be evaluated
using conventional scientific criteria. Experience papers should describe
the practical applications of CIS concepts or methods. They will be
evaluated in terms of lessons learned, research issues raised, and
solutions to realistic challenges, such as those of legacy information
systems.

Five copies of original and compelling unpublished papers up to 5000 words
that are not under consideration for publication elsewhere during the
reviewing period should be sent to the appropriate Programme Committee
Co-Chair. Restricted electronic submission may be acceptable. For
instructions contact the appropriate PC Co-Chair. Submissions must include
contact information (contact name, postal and e-mail address, and phone
number), a 100-word abstract, exact word count, and explicitly indicate the
paper category (vision, research, or experience).

The edited proceedings of CoopIS-94 will appear as a book from a major
international publisher. Selected articles will be considered for
publication in the International Journal of Intelligent and Cooperative
Information Systems.

ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION REQUIRMENTS (to the correct PC co-chair)

Printing PS papers is often problematic (see below). We are treating this
as an experiment. If we can't get your paper to print (with very little
effort on our part) then your paper will not be accepted electronically and
you will have to submit in hard copy form under the FIRM Dec 1 deadline.
Hence, you must provide enough time for such a contingency.

1) Electronic Submission Deadline
We suggest a deadline of November 26 to ensure the paper prints prior to
the FIRM Dec 1 deadline for hard copy submission.

2) Test Your PS versions Before Submitting
We encourage you to submit your paper to us electronically, and in
postscript format. Even though postscript language is the same everywhere,
the way postscript files are made on different machines, and the way some
non-postscript printers emulate the language are, unfortunately, not the
same. We have had problems with postscript files made on Macintosh machines
which didn't print on non-Apple printers and vice versa. Areas of potential
problems include inclusion of font definitions, incompatible printer
headers, and embedded figures. Therefore, if you plan to submit your paper
in postscript format, please make sure that your postscript file prints
correctly on generic, true postscript printers. Also, as a rule of thumb,
don't use fonts which are not included with most postscript printers. If
our printer cannot find the right font, it will substitute a default font
which may ruin layout of your paper. Also let us know on what machine you
made your postscript file. This information will help us in case of a
problem, even though we do not have the time to try to fix serious
problems.

3) Protocol for Submission
Prior to electronic submission, send notice of submission to:
 coopis94NA@gte.com (for the Americas)
 coopis94E@informatik.rwth-aachen.de (Europe and Middle East)
 coopis94F@fitmail.fit.qut.edu.au (Far East,Africa, Australia)

In your message include the information about the machine and the software
that you used to create the postscript file (e.g., FrameMaker on Sun, or
Microsoft Word on Macintosh). At this time, please provide all the
requested information concerning contact address, category of paper, and
topic areas (see above).

After receiving an acknowledgment of your intent to submit electronically,
submit your paper, and wait for an acknowledgment (for confirmation of
submission, receipt, and successful printout, i.e., acceptance). Your paper
will not be consider submitted until it has been printed successfully,
logged, and acknowledged. If your paper does not print, it will not be
accepted and you must submit in the hard copy by the December 1 deadline.
