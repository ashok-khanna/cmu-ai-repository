          FIRST CIRCULAR AND CALL FOR PAPERS

The inaugural Australian National Conference on Complex
Systems was held at the Australian National University in
1992.  Recognising the need to maintain and stimulate
research interest in these topics the University of
Central Queenslandis hosting the Second Australian
National Conference on Complex Systems in Rockhampton.

Rockhampton is situated on the Tropic of Capricorn in
Queensland on the east coast of Australia and is 35kms
from the Central Queensland Coast. It is within easy
access of tourist resorts including the resort island,
Great Keppel, the Central Queensland Hinterland, and the
Great Barrier Reef.

This first circular is intended to provide basic
information about the conference and to canvas expressions
of interest, both in attending and in presenting papers or
posters.  A second circular, to be distributed in late
January/early February, will provide details of keynote
speakers, the program, registration procedures, etc.

Please pass on this notice to interested colleagues.  For
further information contact the organisers (see below).

AIMS:

Complex systems are systems whose evolution is dominated
by non-linearity or interactions between their components.
Such systems may be very simple but reproduce very complex
phenomena.  Terms such as artificial life, biocomplexity,
chaos, criticality, fractals, learning systems, neural
networks, non-linear dynamics, parallel computation,
percolation, self-organization have become common place.
>From this research has emerged many  new paradigms,
cutting across traditional disciplines.


This conference seeks  to bring together researchers from
the Australasian region who are actively involved in
research in Complex Systems for creative discussion. It also
aims to provide an introduction to specialised topics for
people seeking to know more about the theoretical and
practical aspects of research in Complex systems.

The theme of the conference "Mechanism of Adaptation in 
Natural, Man Made and Mathematical Systems", invites us to 
investigate  and question the dynamic processes in complex
systems,  and to compare our overall modelling processes
of natural systems.  Processes such as  evolution,
growth and learning are being investigated through genetic
algorithms, evolutionary programming and neural networks.
How well do these techniques perform and to what extent
do the fit an evolutionary paradigm?  It also raises the
underlying question: "How does order arise in complex
systems?"

PAPERS:

Original papers concerned with both theory and application
are solicited. The areas of interest include,
but are not limited to the following:

 *  Natural and Artificial Life
 *  Genetic Algorithms
 *  Fractals, Chaos and Non-linear Dynamics
 *  Self-organisation
 *  Information and Control Systems
 *  Neural Networks
 *  Parallel and Emergent Computation.   
 *  Bio-Complexity

DATES:

Second Circular                   Jan  31, 1994

Submission of Abstracts:          Mar  14, 1994
Notification of Acceptance:       May  16, 1994
Receipt of Camera-ready papers:   Jul  25, 1994

CONFERENCE ORGANIZATION:

The conference will open with advance registration and a
barbecue party on Sunday 25th September.

The conference fee of $285 ($130 students) will include
morning and afternoon teas and lunch on each day, the
opening barbecue, and the conference dinner.
Accommodation will be available on campus at the
University Residential College and at nearby motels within
walking distance of the University. The conference dinner
is to be held on Tuesday 27th September.

TUTORIALS AND WORKSHOPS:

It is planned to hold one or more introductory tutorials
on selected topics in complex systems on Sunday 25th
September.  The aim of these tutorials will be to
introduce participants to fundamental concepts in complex
systems and to provide them with practical experience.
Tentatively the topics covered will include genetic
algorithms, cellular automata, chaos, and fractals.  The
exact content will depend on demand.  If interested in
attending please indicate your preferences on the attached
expression of interest.   The number of places will be
strictly limited by facilities available.

On Wednesday, advanced workshops may be held on specialised
topics if there is sufficient interest.
Suggestions/offers for advanced workshop topics are
encouraged.

There will be an additional fee for attendance at the
tutorials and workshops, which will include lunch and
refreshments.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Intending authors are requested to submit an extended
abstract of about 500 words, containing a clear, concise
statement of the significant results of the work.  Each
abstract  will be assessed by two referees.  All accepted
papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

                FINAL CIRCULAR - COMPLEX'94

	Second National Conference on Complex Systems


		September 26-28, 1994
		University of Central Queensland
		Rockhampton Queensland
		Australia

THE CONFERENCE THEME

Aims:   Complex  systems   are  systems  whose  evolution   is
dominated  by  non-linearity  or  interactions  between  their
components.   Such systems  may be  very simple  but reproduce
very  complex  phenomena.   Terms  such  as  artificial  life,
biocomplexity,   chaos,   criticality,   fractals,    learning
systems,  neural  networks,   non-linear  dynamics,   parallel
computation,  percolation,  self-  organisation,  have  become
common  place.   From  this  research  has  emerged  many  new
paradigms, cutting across traditional boundaries

This conference seeks to  bring together researchers from  the
Australasian region who are  actively involved in research  in
Complex  Systems  for  creative  discussion.   It also aims to
provide  an  introduction  to  specialised  topics  for people
seeking  to  know  more  about  the  theoretical and practical
aspects of research in Complex Systems.

The  theme  of  the  conference  "Mechanism  of  Adaptation in
Natural,  Man  Made  and  Mathematical  System", invites us to
investigate  and  question  the  dynamic  processes in complex
systems, and  to compare  our overall  modelling processes  of
natural systems.   Processes such  as evolution,  growth,  and
learning are  being investigated  through genetic  algorithms,
evolutionary programming  and neural  networks.   How well  do
these techniques  perform and  to what  extent do  they fit an
evolutionary  paradigm?    It  also   raises  the   underlying
question, "How does order arise in complex systems?"


KEYNOTE SPEAKERS

recognition   integration   with   Neural   Networks,  Machine
Learning and Expert Systems.


John Hutchinson,  'Deterministic and Random Fractals'

Dr Hutchinson  is from  the Australian  National University in
Canberra (AUS).   He has  published research  on Fractals  and
Self Similarity  and his  current interests  are in  Geometric
Calculus of Variations.


PAPERS: 

Original  papers  concerned  with  both theory and application
are solicited.   The areas  of interest  include, but  are not
limited to the following:

 *  Natural and Artificial Life
 *  Genetic algorithms
 *  Fractals, Chaos and Non-linear Dynamics
 *  Self-organisation
 *  Information and Control systems
 *  Neural Networks
 *  Parallel and Emergent Computation
 *  Bio-Complexity

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Owing to  the   latetness of  this   final circular  the  date
for submission  of abstracts has  been extended till the  15th
April 1994.

Intending  authors  are  requested   to  submit  an   extended
abstract  of  about  500  words,  containing  a clear, concise
statement  of  the  significant  results  of their work.  Each
abstract  will  be  assessed  by  two  referees.  All accepted
papers  will  be  published  in  the  conference  proceedings.
Individual  authors  may  be  allocated  to  either an oral or
poster presentation,  but contributions  in both  formats will
appear  identically  in  the   proceedings.   Copies  of   the
proceedings  will   be  provided   to  participants   at   the
conference in hardcopy form.

Papers  can  be  submitted  in  camera-ready  form  and should
conform to  the publisher's  style guidelines  (to be provided
after acceptance).   The preferred  mode of  submission is  as
LaTeX  source,  for  which  a  style  sheet is available.  For
authors unable to supply  LaTeX source, a modified  plain text
form will be specified.



TUTORIALS

At  this  time  the  following  tutorials  are  proposed.  The
program  may  be  changed  depending  upon the availability of
presenters:

[1]  Genetic Algorithms

This tutorial provides  an introduction to  genetic algorithms
and current applications in modern research.

[2]  Neural Networks

This  tutorial   will  examine   the  mathematical   modelling
associated  with  a  number  of  neural network paradigms, and
also  the  applicability  of  neural  networks  in   different
applications.    The  presentation   will  be   supported   by
demonstration  software,  Professional  II/Plus,  from Network
Microsystems.

[3]  Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos

This tutorial will introduce  the basic concepts in  Chaos and
consider in particular the problem of identification of  chaos
in dynamical systems.

[4]  A formal Approach to Heuristic Networks

The goal of  this tutorial is  intended to introduce  computer
scientists  and  graduate  students  to  the  main  ideas  and
results  of  research  on  geometrical  processes  of  complex
control systems - Linguistic geometry.


WORKSHOPS


At this time advanced workshops have not been formalised.   It
is expected to have at  least one advanced workshop on  Hybrid
systems of  Neural Networks  and Genetic  Algorithms.  Further
details will be provided  when the abstracts are  reviewed and
presentation schedules are organised.
