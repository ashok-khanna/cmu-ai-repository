		VR '94 - APPLICATIONS and TRENDS

	    February 9-10, 1994 in Stuttgart/Germany

     Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation


		 CALL FOR PAPERS/PARTICIPATION

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In February 1993 the Fraunhofer Institutes IAO and IPA launched the
first german conference:	"VR '93 - APPLICATIONS and TRENDS"

This significant conference provided informations about the latest
research results and topical applications in Virtual Reality.  Both
Institutes are members of the VR DemoCentre within the Fraunhofer-
Gesellschaft.

The objective of this centre is to transfer the know-how from the
research institutes to industry.

Because of the widespread interest from industry and research, IPA and
IAO will establish a regular forum to support the exchange of
information in the area of VR applications.  "VR '94 - APPLICATIONS
and TRENDS" will inform about the growing number of applications,
especially in the field of telerobotics, medicine, product design and
architecture.  This national forum in Germany applies both to the
potential user as well as to system developers.
