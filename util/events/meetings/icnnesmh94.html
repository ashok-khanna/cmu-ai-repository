     |    International Conference on Neural Networks and   |
     |       Expert Systems in Medicine and Healthcare      |
     |                                                      |
     |         Plymouth, England: 24-26 August, 1994        |
     |                                                      |

    ===========================================================

    In the last few years there has been an explosion of interest in
    a number of intelligent systems techniques, notably in Neural
    Networks and Expert Systems.  Medicine and healthcare  have
    emerged as fertile areas for the application of these techniques
    because they require expertise (which is not always available),
    often involve non-trivial pattern recognition tasks, and because
    of difficulties with conventional methods.

    The aims of the conference are to bring together research
    engineers, medical informaticians, scientists, and medical
    experts, to discuss actual and potential applications of neural
    networks and expert systems in medicine and healthcare, and to
    identify their benefits, limitations, current and future roles.

    The organisers invite papers from prospective authors in
    academia, industry, government and private organisations world
    wide in all areas of medicine and healthcare including, but not
    limited to biosignal processing, medical image processing,
    cardiology, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics,  neurology,
    radiology, occupational medicine, drugs and administration of
    medicine, patient management, therapy, prevention of diseases,
    care and rehabilitation, public health, and data security.
    Papers should come under one of the following general headings:

       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      |  [] Neural Networks & Expert Systems Techniques           |
      |  [] Neural Networks & Expert Systems Applications         |
      |  [] Integration of Neural Networks & Expert Systems into  |
      |      Clinical Environment                                 |
      |  [] Software/Hardware Tools & Environments                |
      |                                                           |
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Practical papers are strongly encouraged, especially those that
    demonstrate significant potential improvements in medicine or
    healthcare,  or cover topics such as the use of concensus
    expertise; limitations of neural networks or expert systems,
    safety and legal issues; hybrid neural networks-expert systems,
    integration with other techniques, e.g genetic algorithms and
    multimedia; decision support tools;  uncertainty handling and
    fuzzy logic; clinical verification, validation and assessment,
    integration of neural networks and expert systems into clinical
    information systems and environments, user interface,
    intelligent databases; computer aided tutoring; novel software
    tools and techniques.

    Prospective authors should submit four copies of extended
    abstracts of 3-4 pages (single spacing and in English) by
    February 18, 1994, to

        ======================================================
       |   Dr. Emmanuel C. Ifeachor                           |
       |   Plymouth Postgraduate Medical School               |
       |   University of Plymouth, Medical Centre, Derriford  |
       |   Pymouth, United Kingdom, PL6 8DH.                  |
        ======================================================

    Each abstract should contain enough detail to permit reviewers
    to judge its suitability, and should indicate the contact
    person, address for correspondence, and which of the four
    headings above is most appropriate for their papers. Authors
    whose abstracts are accepted will be asked to develop the
    abstracts into full papers of not more than 6 pages in length
    for inclusion in the conference proceedings. Authors of papers
    of significant importance will be invited at the end of the
    conference to revise their papers for publication in a special
    edition of a journal of international repute.
