                      ============================

We are soliciting proposals for panels to be included in the technical
program of the 1994 ACM SIGMOD Conference.  Each panel will occupy one
session of 1-1/2 hours.  Preference will be given to topics that are
timely, that will generate lively discussion among the panelists and
conference attendees, and that will appeal to both researchers and
practitioners.  We intend particularly to avoid panels that consist of
a series of presentations with little discussion.

Panel proposals should not exceed one page and should include:
   * Subject of the panel
   * Panel organizer and chair
   * Brief motivation for why the topic is exciting and why it will
     make for an interesting and timely panel
   * List of proposed panelists
   * Proposed format for the panel

All panel proposals should be submitted to the Program Chair:

                            Call for Papers
                  ACM SIGMOD/PODS 94 Joint Conference
       The Minneapolis Hilton and Towers, Minneapolis, Minnesota
                            May 24-27, 1994

The ACM SIGMOD/PODS Joint Conference aims at fostering close
collaboration between the theoretical and applied database communities.
In the decade of the 90s databases are the ascendant technology for
dealing with complex and interdependent information. Our society can
benefit greatly from the full maturation of database technology, and we
hope that the collaboration which will result from this joint conference
will play a seminal role in stimulating this process. We encourage you
to play a part in this important event.

The PODS and SIGMOD conferences have separate program committees and
will have separate proceedings. Authors must submit their papers to the
conference that they feel is most appropriate for their work.  We
recommend that theoretical papers be submitted to PODS and applied ones
to SIGMOD. The same paper or different versions of the same paper should
not be submitted to both conferences simultaneously.  The two
conferences will overlap for two days, but each conference will have a
separate third day without overlap. There will be, however, only one
registration process for the joint, 4-day conference.  Attendees will
receive both proceedings and be encouraged to attend sessions in both
conferences. Some of the technical events, the lunches, and the outing
will be joint events.

Once again, you are invited to participate in what we hope will be an
exciting event.

Sincerely,

                            Paper Submission

You are invited to submit twelve copies of a detailed abstract (not a
complete paper) to the program chair.  A limit of 10 typed pages with
roughly 35 lines/page (about 5000 words or 10K bytes in total) is placed
on submissions. Font size should be 10 points or larger.

The abstract must provide sufficient detail to allow the program
committee to assess the merits of the paper and should include
appropriate references to and comparisons with the literature. It is
recommended that each submission begin with a succinct statement of the
problem, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their
significance and relevance to the conference, all suitable for the
non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the
specialist, should follow.  If the authors believe that more details are
essential to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may include
a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the committee.

The Exhibits Program will consist of a Video Program and a Demonstration
Program of university and laboratory software prototypes related to
database management systems research and practice. Videos should be
full-length (5 to 20 minutes), submitted in VHS-NTSC format, and
accompanied by a project/system description of up to 3,000 words to
appear in the proceedings. Videos will be judged on technical content,
relevance, originality and presentation.  Publishers are invited to
exhibit books and related journals.  Submissions should be sent to the
program chair, who will forward them to the appropriate organizer.

                       Tutorial and Panel Program

There will be a series of sessions focused on issues relevant to
practitioners of DBMS technology. Each panel or tutorial proposal should
include a one-page description of the subject matter, the name of the
organizer, and for panels, a list of proposed panelists.  Submissions
should be addressed to the program chair, who will forward them to the
appropriate organizer.

To Members of the Database Community:

The ACM SIGMOD/PODS 94 Joint Conference continues the tradition of the last
few years in bringing together the theoretical and applied database
communities.  The joint conference will feature the presentation of original
research papers, invited talks, tutorials, industrial sessions, a panel, and
demonstrations of experimental database prototypes.

The SIGMOD and PODS conferences will overlap for two days, but each conference
will have a separate third day without overlap. There will be, however, only
one registration process for the joint, four-day conference.  Attendees will
receive both proceedings and be encouraged to attend sessions in both
conferences. The award session, reception, lunches and the banquet are joint
events.

The computing environment in the 90s is changing rapidly into a truly
distributed one with processors ranging from PCs to supercomputers linked
together via high-speed networks. Enormous amount of diverse information is
becoming available to individuals through the Internet or the future
information superhighway.  The development of database technology for dealing
with very large multimedia, complex, and interdependent information is
critical for our society to benefit fully from the new environment.

The SIGMOD/PODS Joint Conference represents the combined efforts of the
theoretical and applied database communities to tackle the new challenges
facing the database professionals.  We encourage you to participate in what
promises to be an exciting and important event.
