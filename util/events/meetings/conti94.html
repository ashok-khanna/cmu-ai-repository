TIMISOARA
=========

Timisoara, one of the major Romanian cities, is situated in the west of 
Romania and has a population of about 350,000 inhabitants.

Mentioned in documents already since 1212, the city still keeps parts of 
its old fortress, together with Huniade Castle, dating back to the 14th century.

The town was a pashalic between 1552-1716; in 1718 Banat became an Austrian
province.

In the 18th century the first factories appeared, Bega became a navigating 
canal, trade and industry were flourishing all over the province.

In the 19th century, new developments followed - the first telegraph(1854),
the first telephone(1881), first European town to use street lighting(1884),
the first horse-drawn tramways(1869), the first electric tramways(1899).

Following up to date trends, at present Timisoara is the main economic and
cultural centre in the western part of the country and is considered the most
related in spirit to western civilisation.

At the same time, Timisoara has a high reputation among Romanian towns due
to its high standards of culture and civilisation. The Opera House, various 
Theatres, the Philarmonic, Art Galleries, are just a few of the representative 
cultural institutions. 

Following the educational tradition of the area - the first Romanian schools
in Banat in the 14th century, secondary and grammar schools in the 18th 
century - Timisoara turned into a top university centre with four universities
training over 25,000 students in technical studies, science, humanities, 
medical science and agricultural studies.

In December 1989 it was Timisoara that started the Romanian Revolution, 
keeping alive the spirit of freedom and democracy.
