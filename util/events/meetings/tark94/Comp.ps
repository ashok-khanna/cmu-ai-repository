TARK V Information
------------------

The following information is intended to answer most of your logistical
questions about the TARK V conference (Theoretical Aspects of
Reasoning about Knowledge), which will be held at
the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California, on
March 13-16, 1994.

Registration forms (and registration fees) are due at Asilomar
on February 1, 1994.

Asilomar: Asilomar is situated on the tip of the Monterey Peninsula
overlooking the Pacific Ocean, 120 miles south of San Francisco.  Asilomar
occupies 105 secluded acres of forest and dune, with pleasant
forested pathways and a swimming pool on the grounds.  Just over the
dunes, Asilomar State Beach stretches for over a mile.
Monterey is an interesting historical city, including the Cannery Row 
area made famous by John Steinbeck's book of the same
name and the Monterey Bay Aquarium and research laboratory.
Nearby, Carmel and Big Sur offer quaint towns, pleasant beaches, a rugged
coastline, and some of the most famous golf courses in the world.
The weather is mild, with temperatures in the 60's and
70's and a chance of rain; the evenings can be cool, and we
recommend bringing a jacket.

Transportation to Asilomar:
The simplest way to reach Asilomar is to fly into Monterey.
Several commercial and commuter airlines including United,
USAir, and American fly to Monterey from West Coast cities
such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Jose.
This makes it easy to fly to San Francisco or San Jose and then on to 
Monterey. After landing in Monterey, you can walk out to the curb and take
a short ride on a shuttle bus from the Monterey airport to Asilomar
for about $14.

If you fly into San Jose or San Francisco and do not wish to fly on to
Monterey, it is best to rent a car.
The San Jose airport is about one and a half hours away from Monterey
by car. The San Francisco airport is about two and half hours away by car.
In both cases, leave the airport on Highway 101 South and follow the
driving directions below.
Public transportation is a cheaper but inconvenient alternative.
Greyhound buses go from the San Francisco airport to Monterey several
times a day (currently at 1:20 and 5:40 in the afternoon).
The trip lasts between three and four hours.
Asilomar can be reached from the Greyhound station with a short cab
ride or on local buses.

Driving to Asilomar: Asilomar recommends the following routes.
When arriving on Highway 1, turn onto Highway 68 West at the 
``Pacific Grove Exit'' near Carmel, and follow the signs to the
Asilomar Conference Center.
When arriving on Highway 101 from the north (from San Francisco and 
San Jose), turn onto Highway 156 West near Prunedale; Highway 156 West 
will merge with Highway 1 South, and proceed as above.
When arriving on Highway 101 from the south (from Los Angeles), turn 
onto Highway 68 just before Salinas; Highway 68 will merge with
Highway 1 South, and proceed as above.

Travel Reimbursement: The conference has no money available to subsidize 
travel or other expenses of attendees.

Accommodations: During the conference, all participants will live in 
rooms on the grounds of the Asilomar Conference Center.
Asilomar is quite heavily booked, but it may be possible to
extend your stay there either on the Asilomar grounds or at nearby hotels.
If you are interested in doing this, contact Asilomar directly
at the address below.
Meals are served in the cafeteria during posted hours.


Telephones, televisions, and mail: There are no phones in the sleeping rooms,
but there are public telephones available in the main lodge and other
locations for local and long distance calls.
People can reach you by calling the Asilomar telephone number below
and leaving a message for you at the front desk.
There are no televisions in sleeping rooms.
If you expect to receive mail during the conference, it should
indicate your name, TARK, and the date of your arrival.
Mail will be held at the front desk for pickup.

Smoking and Pets: Smoking is not allowed in sleeping rooms.
Please refrain from smoking in the meeting areas and in other rooms
shared with non-smokers. Asilomar requests that you not bring pets.
