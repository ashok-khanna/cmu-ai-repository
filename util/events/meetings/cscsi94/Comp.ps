                            CALL FOR PAPERS

                                 AI'94
              Canadian Artificial Intelligence Conference

                            Banff Park Lodge
                         Banff, Alberta, Canada
                            May 16-20, 1994
                                   

AI'94 is the tenth biennial conference on Artificial Intelligence
sponsored by the Canadian Society for the Computational Study of
Intelligence.  AI'94 will be held in conjunction with AI/GI/VI'94.
AI/GI/VI'94 is a unique event with three Canadian research conferences
that present the latest results in artificial intelligence, computer
graphics, and computer vision.  Each conference offers three concurrent
days of invited and submitted papers.  For a single registration fee,
conference participants can attend presentations in any of the three,
promoting the exchange of knowledge among these important disciplines.
Two days have been set aside for workshops and other events.  A banquet
and electronic theatre provide additional opportunities to meet speakers
and other attendees for informal discussion in a social setting.

The conference will be held at the Banff Park Lodge, Banff, Alberta.
Banff is located in the spectacular Canadian Rockies, the beauty of
which remains unsurpassed, and is just an hour and a half drive from
Calgary.  The Calgary International Airport can be reached from many
North American cities via many different airlines.  In addition, there
is direct bus service from the Calgary International Airport to Banff,
or alternatively one can arrange a limousine or rental car at the
airport.  The ski season usually ends around the 24th of May at
Sunshine, so ski enthusiasts may enjoy spring skiing at its finest.
For non-skiers there are many other activities to occupy their time.

Contributions are invited that present original, unpublished results in
all areas of Artificial Intelligence.  Submitted papers must not exceed
5000 words in length, including abstract and bibliography.  Theoretical
and position papers will be judged on their originality and contribution
to the field of AI, and applied papers on the importance and originality
of the application.  To help in the review process, authors should list,
in decreasing order of relevance, 1 to 3 of the following keywords:

applications        learning                reasoning (indicate subarea)
search              cognitive modelling     knowledge representation
planning            architectures           knowledge acquisition
perception          robotics                language understanding
problem solving     theorem proving         neural nets/connectionism

Authors should submit four (4) complete copies of the paper in hardcopy
form, for review by members of the program committee.  Acceptance
depends on the overall merit and significance of the reported research,
as well as the quality of the written presentation.  Each copy of the
paper must include a cover page, separate from the body of the paper,
which includes, in order, (1) title of the paper, (2) full names,
postal addresses, phone numbers, and email address of all authors, (3)
an abstract of no more than 250 words, and (4) keywords to classify the
paper for review purposes.  As a condition of acceptance, the author or
a co-author must present the paper at the conference.  If the paper is
being submitted to other conferences, either in verbatim or in essence,
authors must clearly indicate this on the cover page.

Papers should be sent to the program chair, Renee Elio.  Papers must be
received by 15 November 1993.  Notification of acceptance or rejection
will be mailed to the first author by 7 February 1994.  Camera ready
copy of accepted papers is due 24 March 1994.  Each paper will be
allotted up to eight (8) pages in the conference proceedings, formatted
using 12pt LaTeX or equivalent.  The journal Artificial Intelligence
intends to publish the ``best paper'' of the conference, and provide a
prize.  Selection of the best paper will be done by the program
committee.
