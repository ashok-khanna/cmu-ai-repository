   TUTORIAL 4

   TITLE: "AGENT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 
		 -- An Approach to Developing Distributed Real-Time Systems"

   PRESENTER:   Dr. Anand S. Rao (Senior Research Scientist)
   		AAII (Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute)

   VENUE:       Grand Hyatt, Melbourne

   TIME:        Tuesday, 16 November, 2:00-5:20pm


This tutorial will introduce participants to the emerging paradigm of
agent-oriented programming, discuss its foundations, describe systems
designed using this paradigm, and examine industrial applications built
using such agent-oriented systems.

Modern societies depend upon large distributed systems in applications
as diverse as telecommunications, power distribution, transport, air
traffic control, and medical services.  All these systems require
careful management and control if they are to provide an acceptable
level of service to the community.  Similarly, complex systems such as
aircraft, railways, power stations, oil refineries and large natural
gas facilities require sophisticated and flexible management and
control.  Despite significant automation in these areas, the resulting
growth of these systems has meant that they have become highly complex
and thus increasingly difficult for human operators to manage and
control efficiently.

Conventional design and software techniques have been found to be
inadequate to handle the complexity and flexibility required for
automating such complex systems. Object-oriented design and
object-oriented programming are increasingly being seen as tools to
overcome this complexity. In the object-oriented paradigm a system is
composed of objects that encapsulate both the data and the methods or
procedures which operate on this data. Objects communicate with each
other using messages. The paradigm provides data and program
abstraction and hides the implementation details of an object from
other objects.

This tutorial will introduce participants to a new paradigm, which
goes beyond the existing object-oriented paradigm, namely the
agent-oriented paradigm. In this paradigm, a system is viewed as a
collection of autonomous agents embedded in an environment,
continuously receiving perceptual input from the environment, and
reacting to it by taking certain actions. The actions taken by the
agent are dependent on its internal mental state, which is composed of
the beliefs, desires or goals, plans, and intentions. In addition
to data abstraction offered by the object-oriented paradigm, the agent-
oriented paradigm offers a powerful form of task abstraction.

The tutorial will consist of three main sections. The first section
will introduce the concepts underlying the agent-oriented paradigm.
Object-oriented programming, real-time system design, expert systems
technology, and reactive situated planning have all contributed to the
emergence of this paradigm. These topics will be briefly reviewed to
give the participants an historical perspective of the approach.

The second section will look at the design of agent-oriented systems.
It will describe the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS), one of the
first agent-oriented systems. The different components of the system
and their functionality will be discussed in detail. 

The third section will consider two case studies in the design and
implementation of agent-oriented systems, namely, a real-time network
management system and an air-combat modelling system. The tutorial
will conclude by giving a preview into the current status of research
in this area and the kind of systems that can be expected in the next
three to five years.

    PRESENTERS' BACKGROUNDS:

Anand S. Rao is a Senior Research Scientist at the Australian
Artificial Intelligence Institute. He received his PhD from University
of Sydney in 1988 on the topic of {\em Dynamics of Belief Systems}.
As a research student he spent a year at the IBM T. J. Watson Research
Center. On completing his doctorate he joined the Australian
Artificial Intelligence Institute and has since been actively involved
in the theoretical and practical development of agent-oriented
systems. His contributions range from the theoretical investigations
of the mental state of an agent to the development of agent-oriented
applications such as the Interactive Real-Time Network Management
System for Telecom Australia, Air-Combat Modelling System for
DSTO-ARL, and an Air-Traffic Management System for the Civil Aviation
Authority. He has published over 30 research papers in international
conferences and journals.

PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE

No prerequisites.  Familiarity with expert systems and/or
object-oriented methodology would be useful.

	1993 AUSTRALIAN JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

		   AI'93 REGISTRATION BROCHURE

		       GRAND HYATT HOTEL
		      MELBOURNE, VICTORIA

		      16-19 NOVEMBER, 1993


	 An invitation to participate...

	 On behalf of the organising committee, we are very pleased to
	 invite you to attend AI'93, to be held in Melbourne from
	 November 16th to 19th. The Australia AI conference has grown
	 in stature over the years, and now attracts a growing
	 proportion of papers from throughout the world. This year we
	 have received over 135 papers for consideration, with around
	 45% coming from overseas.

	 The conference programme features three world-renowned experts
	 in very different fields of expertise. Earl Sacerdoti is known
	 for both his pioneering work in AI, and for his work on
	 technology transfer. Mary O'Kane is renowned for her work in
	 speech recognition. Our third speaker, Chris Wallace, is a
	 pre-eminent authority in machine learning. So you can be
	 guaranteed a wide variety of invited talks. There is an
	 extensive workshop programme, a wide range of tutorials, and
	 active technical sessions.

	 AI as a technology has not been without its problems. But
	 there is a growing presence of real applications in operation,
	 and a gradual understanding of the significance of the field,
	 which is reflected in the conference programme. It is also
	 perhaps one of the great research challenges, so we should not
	 be surprised at the controversy that continues to surround
	 AI.

	 We look forward to meeting with you and joining in a
	 successful conference.
