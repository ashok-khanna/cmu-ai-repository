In cooperation with:
  ACM SIGSOFT, Japan ACM SIGMOD, IEEE Computer Society - Technical
  Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE), Information Processing
  Society of Japan (IPSJ)

Goals:

  Object technologies are attracting much attention in diverse areas
  of research and development for advanced software.  Object-oriented
  (OO) programming holds a great promise in reducing the complexity of
  large scale software development, and recent research in this field
  promises to open up a new paradigm for parallel and reflective
  computing.  Object-oriented databases are expected to serve as a
  model for next generation database systems, by overcoming the
  limitations of conventional data models.  Recently, research in
  software object bases is aimed at developing a uniform approach to
  the management of software artifacts produced in the software
  development process, such as specifications, manuals, programs, and
  test data, which traditionally were managed in a very ad-hoc and
  arbitrary manner.

  Active research and experimentation on object technologies in these
  diverse areas suggest that there are some underlying, fundamental
  principles common to a wide range of software development
  activities.  The first of the JSSST international series of symposia
  focuses on this topic.  The aim of this symposium is to bring
  together leading researchers in the areas of object-oriented
  programming, object-oriented databases, and software object bases.
  We hope to promote an understanding of object technologies in a
  wider context and to make progress towards the goal of finding a
  better framework for future advanced software development.
