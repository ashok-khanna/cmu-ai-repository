                              SCAI'95

       FIFTH SCANDINAVIAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 

                Trondheim, Norway, May 29 - 31, 1995


                        FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS


The biennial Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence is the
open Scandinavian forum for scientific exchange and presentation of AI
research. The aim of the conference is to cover all aspects of AI
research, and to bring together basic and applied research.  The
technical program will include paper and poster presentations, invited
talks and panels.  An award will be given to the best student paper.

The major theme for SCAI'95 will be `Theory meets Practice', with
facilitation of feedback from real world applications to the
researchers as a central goal. Industry is particularly encouraged to
submit papers.

The fifth SCAI is hosted by the University of Trondheim and 
SINTEF DELAB, in cooperation with the Norwegian AI Society, NAIS.

Submission of papers

Welcome to Trondheim !
----------------------

Trondheim is the third largest city and the technical capital of
Norway. Trondheim was already a center of power in Norway in 997, when
the Viking king Olav Tryggvason founded a trading town at the mouth of
the Nid river and built a castle there. Trondheim became Norway's
first capital.

Modern Trondheim features culture, research and education, besides
trade and industry. The Norwegian Institute of Technology (abbreviated
in Norwegian: NTH) was established here in 1910 and is the only
technical university in the country. A major technological environment
has grown up around it, larger than any other technological center in
Norway. The other major part of the University is the College of Arts
and Science (AVH), which has grown from a rather small college 25
years ago, to its present size equal to NTH. With its 16000 students,
the University of Trondheim is the second largest in Norway. Close to
the University there is Scandinavia's largest foundation for
scientific and industrial research - SINTEF - with 2200 employees
performing contract research and development for industry and public
sector.

Take the opportunity to participate in both technical and cultural
events during SCAI'95. 

We look forward to seeing you in Trondheim!
