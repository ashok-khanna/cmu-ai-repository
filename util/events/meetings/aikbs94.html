Welcome Address:

On behalf of the National Organizing Committee it is my pleasure to
invite you to participate in the second IFAC Workshop on Computer
Software Structures Integrating AI/KBS Systems in Process Control,
which will be held between 10 and 12 August 1994 in Lund, Sweden.  The
aim of the Workshop is to inform about where the leading edge is in
the integration of AI/KBS systems in real-time process control, what
the primary challenges are to future advances, and how computer
science, process control, and related technologies can contribute to
these advances. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and
knowledge-based systems (KBS) has created a strong interest in
applying these technologies to process control.

The Workshop will focus on solutions that meet the needs of real-time
operations, data synchronization, and execution speed while
satisfying control systems functionality and integration
constraints. New practical and theoretical avenues (in
architectures, languages, executives) that provide a basis for
effective coexistence of, and execution of, real-time and
knowledge-based modules in modern process control systems are among
the topics of interest.  The scope of the Workshop includes software
integration issues, knowledge representation and modeling, monito-
ring and diagnosis, control, operator support, and applications.

The preliminary program contains two plenary addresses and ten
sessions with 38 papers selected by the International Program
Committee from the draft papers submitted. An exhibition of
relevant software and tools is organized in connection with the
Workshop.  The Workshop is located in the centre of the charming old
university town Lund in the southern part of Sweden.  An exciting
program of social events will be arranged.  

I look forward to meeting you in Lund.

NOC & IPC Chairman

Excursion and dinner:

On Thursday evening there will be a bus excursion in the 
beautiful countryside of Skane, the southern province of 
Sweden. In case of bad weather this will be changed to an 
indoors event. Later in the evening a dinner will be 
served at Svaneholm castle, some 30 km south of Lund.

About Lund and Sweden:

Lund is situated in the province of Skåne in southern 
Sweden. It is an old medieval town with a well preserved 
historical centre and many attractions.

Sights:

The Cathedral is a famous tourist attraction, consecrated 
in 1145. The University of Lund was founded in 1666 and 
the present main building was ready in 1882. In Lund 
there are many interesting museums and a beautiful 
Botanical Garden. The Tourist Office will gladly help you 
with information about city walking tours and castle 
tours, weekend arrangements etc. Also the surroundings 
of Lund offer many attractions. It¹s even possible to visit 
the famous glassworks in the province of Smaland, by a 
one-day bus trip to `Glasriket', about 180 km from Lund.

Weather:

The weather in early August is normally pleasant with a 
temperature between 20 C and 30 C and not much rain. 
The evenings may, however, be cool.

Shopping:

Shops are generally open from 10.00 to 18.00 on week-
days, to 13.00 on Saturdays. Most of them accept credit 
cards like Eurocard, Master card, and Visa. The recent 
devaluation of the Swedish krona has made Swedish 
prices very competitive. Some shops offer refund of sales 
tax.

Currency:
Domestic currency is kronor (SEK) and ore.  
Coins: 50 ore, 1 krona, 5 kronor, 10 kronor.  Notes: 20, 
(50), 100, 500, and 1000 kronor.  1 US$ approx. 8 SEK.
