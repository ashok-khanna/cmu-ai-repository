We cordially invite you to contribute to the "Intelligent
Autonomous Systems Symposium" to be held as part of the 12th
European Meeting on  Cybernetics and Systems Research. The
conference dates are April 5 - 8, 1994 and the location is the
historic city of Vienna.

We are soliciting papers that cover, but are not limited to, the
following areas:

- design of intelligent autonomous systems
- methods and tools for autonomous system design
- modelling and simulation of autonomous systems
- AI concepts for intelligent autonomous systems
- planning and learning
- artificial perception
- micro system engineering and intelligent autonomous systems

Contributions in the form of draft final papers should be sent to
the Conference Secretariat not later than October 8th, 1993 with
a copy of your submission to one of us. In your cover letter, please
refer to the Intelligent Autonomous Systems Symposium (M).

After the conference, selected papers will be published in a
special issue of an archival journal related to the symposium's theme.

For your information, we have enclosed the brochure announcement
with further details. Please convey this information to your
colleagues and associates.

We look forward to hearing from you and we hope to meet you in
Vienna.

About the Congress:
- -------------------
The international support of the European Meetings on Cybernetics and
Systems Research held in Austria in 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982,
1984, 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992 (when 300 scientists from more than 30
countries met to present, hear and discuss 210 papers) encouraged the
Council of the Austrian Society for Cybernetic Studies (OSGK) to organize a
similar meeting in 1994 to keep pace with continued rapid developments in
related fields.

A number of Symposia will be arranged and we are grateful to colleagues who
have undertaken the task of preparing these events. As on the earlier
occasions, eminent speakers of international reputation will present latest
research results at daily plenary sessions.

The Proceedings of the 10th and 11th European Meetings on Cybernetics and
Systems Research, edited by R. Trappl, have been published by World
Scientific, Singapore as :
   CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS '90 (1 vol., 1107 p.)
