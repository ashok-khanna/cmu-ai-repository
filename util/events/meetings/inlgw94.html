                      CALL FOR PAPERS

    7th International Workshop on Natural Language Generation

                      21-24 June 1994
                    Kennebunkport, Maine

PURPOSE AND SCOPE: Continuing the tradition of earlier meetings,
recently in Trento (1992) and Pittsburgh (1990), the 7th International
Workshop on Natural Language Generation aims to bring together the
members of the generation community to present their new ideas and
ongoing work.

To encourage a workshop atmosphere while allowing a relatively large
number of people to participate, selected papers will be given large
time slots. Other papers will be grouped into panels for shorter
presentations, and there will be sessions for posters.

Papers presenting new and innovative work are solicited on any aspect
of natural language generation, including but not at all limited to:
text planning, realization, content determination, the architecture of
full generation systems, multilingual or multimodal generation,
applications, lexical choice, or learning methods; as well as any
aspects of other areas of computational linguistics as they effect or
are effected by problems in generation, such as grammatical theory,
data analysis and the use of corpora, or speech synthesis and
intonation; submissions from other fields such as psycholinguistics or
neuroscience that bear on the generation process are also encouraged.


FORMAT: Authors should send four copies of a full paper in hard copy
to the address below. An additional electronic copy, in plain ascii,
should be sent by email.  Papers may be up to 8,000 words long. The
title page should include complete addresses including email and fax,
word length, subject keywords, and a short summary. Papers with
several authors should indicate who is to handle correspondence.
Shorter submissions specifically for posters are encouraged for work
that is not yet mature.

Send submissions to:
   Mail:  David McDonald, 14 Brantwood Road
          Arlington, MA  02174-8004, USA
   Email:  mcdonald@cs.brandeis.edu


SCHEDULE: Papers must be received by February 15, 1994. Notification
of acceptance or rejection will be given by April 15. A camera-ready
copy of the final version of the paper for an informal proceedings
must be ready by May 15.


Attendance at the workshop will be limited; the workshop facilities
can accomodate approximately 100 participants. Should more people wish
to attend than can be accomodated, attendance will be first come first
served after preference has been given to the people who submitted
papers.
