Tutorial T1: Roles of Optics in Parallel Computing and High-Speed 
Communications
by Ahmed Louri - University of Arizona
8:30 am - 5:00 pm (Martaban)
This tutorial will start by examining the state-of-the-art in parallel 
computing, including parallel processing paradigms, hardware, and 
software.  We will then discuss the basic concepts of optics in 
computing and communications and the motivations for considering 
optics and ways in which optics might provide significant 
enhancements to the computing and communications technologies.  
The tutorial will include some case studies of optical computing and 
switching systems.  Current research and future applications of 
optical computing are discussed.

Tutorial T2: Functional Programming
by Patrick Miller and John Feo - Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory
8:30 am - 5:00 pm (Rangoon)
The objective of this tutorial is to familiarize the participants with 
the current state of functional languages.  We will cover both 
theoretical and practical issues.  We will explain the mathematical 
principals that form the foundation of functional languages, and 
from which they derive their advantages.  We will survey a 
representative set of existing functional languages and different 
implementation strategies.  We will use the functional language 
Sisal to expose the participants to the art of functional 
programming.

Tutorial T3: Instruction Scheduling
by Barbara Simons and Vivek Sarkar - IBM Corp.
8:30 - 12:00 noon (Nepal)
In this tutorial we describe different models of deterministic 
scheduling, including pipeline scheduling, scheduling with inter-
instructional latencies, scheduling VLIW machines, and assigned 
processor scheduling.  In addition, we present an overview of 
important extensions to the basic block scheduling problem.  The 
program dependence graph, annotated with weights, provides a 
good representation for global instruction scheduling beyond a 
basic block.  Finally, we describe the close interaction between the 
problems of instruction scheduling and register allocation.

Tutorial T4: Software Systems and Tools for Distributed 
Programming 
by Anand Tripathi - University of Minnesota
1:30-5:00 pm (Nepal)
This tutorial will present an overview of the most commonly used 
paradigms and models for distributed computing.  This discussion 
will address interprocess communication models and heterogeneous 
computing issues.  An overview of the object model of computing 
will be presented in the context of micro-kernel architectures for 
distributed computing.  The programming languages and tools to be 
discussed here include Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM), P4, Linda,

Tutorial T1: Roles of Optics in Parallel Computing and High-Speed
Communications
by Ahmed Louri - University of Arizona
8:30 am - 5:00 pm (Martaban)
This tutorial will start by examining the state-of-the-art in parallel
computing, including parallel processing paradigms, hardware, and
software.  We will then discuss the basic concepts of optics in
computing and communications and the motivations for considering
optics and ways in which optics might provide significant
enhancements to the computing and communications technologies.
The tutorial will include some case studies of optical computing and
switching systems.  Current research and future applications of
optical computing are discussed.

Tutorial T2: Functional Programming
by Patrick Miller and John Feo - Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory
8:30 am - 5:00 pm (Rangoon)
The objective of this tutorial is to familiarize the participants with
the current state of functional languages.  We will cover both
theoretical and practical issues.  We will explain the mathematical
principals that form the foundation of functional languages, and
from which they derive their advantages.  We will survey a
representative set of existing functional languages and different
implementation strategies.  We will use the functional language
Sisal to expose the participants to the art of functional
programming.

Tutorial T3: Instruction Scheduling
by Barbara Simons and Vivek Sarkar - IBM Corp.
8:30 - 12:00 noon (Nepal)
In this tutorial we describe different models of deterministic
scheduling, including pipeline scheduling, scheduling with inter-
instructional latencies, scheduling VLIW machines, and assigned
processor scheduling.  In addition, we present an overview of
important extensions to the basic block scheduling problem.  The
program dependence graph, annotated with weights, provides a
good representation for global instruction scheduling beyond a
basic block.  Finally, we describe the close interaction between the
problems of instruction scheduling and register allocation.

Tutorial T4: Software Systems and Tools for Distributed
Programming
by Anand Tripathi - University of Minnesota
1:30-5:00 pm (Nepal)
This tutorial will present an overview of the most commonly used
