May 3 is the advance registration deadline for the 1994 ACM SIGMOD
International Conference on Management of Data and SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART
Symposium on Principles of Database Systems (PODS). Registration forms
postmarked by then will receive reduced rates. Mail-in registration forms
arriving by May 16 will be accepted, but on-site rates will apply. Get
those registration forms in! For your convenience, an abbreviated advance
program with hotel and conference registration forms is attached.

The complete advance program and the conference and hotel registration
forms are available in PostScript and text format via anonymous ftp at
ftp.cs.arizona.edu (directory sigmodpods94) and in the SIGMOD Information
Server, accessible via Mosaic at URL http://bunny.cs.uiuc.edu/README.html.
----
To Members of the Database Community:

The ACM SIGMOD/PODS 94 Joint Conference continues the tradition of the last
few years in bringing together the theoretical and applied database
communities.  The joint conference will feature the presentation of original
research papers, invited talks, tutorials, industrial sessions, a panel, and
demonstrations of experimental database prototypes.

The SIGMOD and PODS conferences will overlap for two days, but each conference
will have a separate third day without overlap. There will be, however, only
one registration process for the joint, four-day conference.  Attendees will
receive both proceedings and be encouraged to attend sessions in both
conferences. The award session, reception, lunches and the banquet are joint
events.

The computing environment in the 90s is changing rapidly into a truly
distributed one with processors ranging from PCs to supercomputers linked
together via high-speed networks. Enormous amount of diverse information is
becoming available to individuals through the Internet or the future
information superhighway.  The development of database technology for dealing
with very large multimedia, complex, and interdependent information is
critical for our society to benefit fully from the new environment.

The SIGMOD/PODS Joint Conference represents the combined efforts of the
theoretical and applied database communities to tackle the new challenges
facing the database professionals.  We encourage you to participate in what
promises to be an exciting and important event.

David Du, SIGMOD General Chair
Mihalis Yannakakis, PODS General Chair

LOCATION

Minneapolis, Minnesota combined with St. Paul (called the "Twin Cities") is
the largest metropolitan area in the upper mid-west with 2.4 million
population. The Twin Cities are famous for their clean and healthy environment
with hundreds of lakes, more than 50 golf courses, and numerous city, county
and state parks. It has been ranked in the top 5 most liveable cities in the
United States in the last few years.  Minneapolis has a pleasant climate in
late May. The average temperature is 65F (19C). The conference will be held at
Minneapolis Hilton and Towers Hotel which is located in the heart of downtown
Minneapolis.  The hotel is connected via skyway to the Minneapolis Convention
Center, Orchestra Hall and all of the downtown shopping attractions.  Nearby
tourist attractions include the Mall of America (the largest shopping mall in
the United States, with more than 300 shops), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis
Institute of Art, Minnesota Science Museum, Minnesota State Capitol, Minnesota
Zoo, and several music groups and theaters.
