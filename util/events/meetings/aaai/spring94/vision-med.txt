				  ANNOUNCEMENT

			AAAI 1994 Spring Symposium Series
	   APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION IN MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING
			        March 21-23, 1994
			       Stanford University


Significant interest and activity in medical image processing has
developed among computer vision researchers in the last several years.
This interdisciplinary activity is still in a relatively early stage
of development, in terms of applied technology, and the size of the
research efforts.

This symposium is intended to serve several purposes:

* To bring together vision and robotics researchers
  who are currently applying computer vision to medical
  image processing problems.

* To increase communication between established researchers
  in medical image processing and computer vision researchers.

* To provide information to researchers that are
  interested in the field.

The symposium will consist of short presentations of papers and work
in progress, and discussions.  Working notes will be produced and
distributed to the participants.

Specific areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:

* image guided medical procedures / robotics
* image processing applied to laparoscopic and other endoscopic procedures
* change detection in medical images
* recognition in medical images
* multimodal registration of medical images
* elastic registration of medical images
* motion analysis in medical images
* anatomical atlases
* applications of computer vision in segmentation of medical imagery

Prospective participants are invited to submit one of the following to
the symposium chair by October 15, 1993: an abstract of a paper to be
presented, a description of research in progress, or a statement
describing what you hope to contribute to and gain from the symposium.
