		   PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE ANNOUNCEMENT		

		Conference on Computer-Aided Verification
		
				CAV 1994

Stanford University
June 21-23, 1994

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This preliminary notice is being sent out now so that people can make
travel arrangements soon.  More details will appear in a few days.

The Sixth Conference on Computer-Aided Verification will be held June
21-23 at Stanford University.  The conference will be followed on June
24th by a one-day workshop on practical aspects of computer-aided
formal verification.

CAV 94 is sponsored by a group of companies with a strong interest in
the topic area: AT&T, IBM, Intel, Motorola, Redwood Design Automation
and Sun Microsystems.

IMPORTANT NOTE: World Cup matches will be held at Stanford on June
20th and 24th, which will contribute to congestion both locally and in
air travel.  Please make your flight reservations as soon as possible!

WORKSHOP: On Friday, June 24th, there will be a one-day workshop
consisting of presentations by both developers and users of formal
verification tools, with special emphasis on experiences on
applications.  This is still being arranged -- more details will
follow shortly.

LOCATION: The conference will be held on the Stanford campus.
Stanford will provide housing and food for participants in student
residences.  Participants may opt to stay in local hotels, but rooms
will be scarce due to the World Cup Finals being held in the area at
that time.

The Stanford Campus is about 30-40 minutes drive from two major
international airports, San Francisco and San Jose.  Commercial
shuttle service is available.

REGISTRATION: Please complete the attached reservation form and either
email or physically mail it with payment to the appropriate address.

HOUSING: We strongly encourage participants to stay on campus to
promote interaction with other conference participants.  The cost of
rooms and all meals (except for dinner on Wednesday night) will be
$217 for three days and nights.  A room may be reserved for the night
of Thursday, June 23, for an additional $39.  There is also a $50 key
deposit that will be refunded upon checkout.  A few rooms may be
reserved for subsequent nights (for participants who wish to tour the
Bay area), depending on availability.  Dinner on Wednesday will be a
banquet at another site (transportation will be provided).  Student
registration does NOT include the banquet Wednesday.

PARKING: Parking permits will be available on request at registration.
Parking is available near the dorms.

CLIMATE:  The weather will almost certainly be 72-80 degrees (F)
with cloudless skies.  It generally cools down significantly in the
evenings (in the 50s), so a sweater is helpful if you are out in the
evening.  At other places in the Bay area (e.g. parts San Francisco),
it can by foggy and very cool.

FURTHER INFORMATION: You can send electronic mail to
"cav@hohum.stanford.edu" if you have further questions about the
conference.
