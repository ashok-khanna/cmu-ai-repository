INVITED TUTORIAL 1

		 The Calculus of Inductive Definitions
			and its Implementation:
			the Coq Proof Assistant

			Christine Paulin-Mohring
			     LIP/ENS Lyon
			cpaulin@lip.ens-lyon.fr

Type Theory serves as a basis for several environments dedicated to the
formalization of reasoning. We shall present the theory and practice of
one of them: the Coq Proof Assistant.

This environment is based on a typed lambda-calculus called the Calculus
of Inductive Definitions. It is a powerful language which extends the
Calculus of Constructions, introduced by Coquand and Huet, with a
mechanism for general inductive definitions in the spirit of
Martin-Lof's Intuitionistic Type Theory.

The Coq proof assistant can be decomposed into three parts.

 o A specification language which combines higher-order logic,
   functional programming and inductive definitions of relations.

 o A tactic language which provides several tools for the
   interactive development of proofs of formulas.

 o An environment for manipulating  proof-terms built by the
   system, especially for extracting ML programs out of constructive
   proofs of specifications.


INVITED TUTORIAL 2

	       Problem Solving by Quantifier Elimination

			       Hoon Hong

	      Research Institute for Symbolic Computation
		    Johannes Kepler University, Linz
		       hhong@risc.uni-linz.ac.at


The tutorial consists of two parts:

(1) We describe and illustrate the following view:

    "Many non-trivial problem solving processes are essentially
    quantifier elimination (qe) processes.  In fact, it (qe) is a core
    of constructive mathematics and computer science.  Thus
    automating problem solving usually amounts to devising methods
    for quantifier elimination."

(2) We describe a few quantifier elimination algorithms for the
    first order theory of real numbers (formally called real closed
    fields).  We give several examples of their use in solving
    various problems.  If time allows, we give a survey of other
    theories that also admit quantifier elimination.


INVITED TUTORIAL 3

		     Negation in Logic Programming

	Krzysztof R. Apt                        Roland Bol
 Mathematics and Computer Science     Mathematics and Computer Science
   CWI & University of Amsterdam     Eindhoven University of Technology
	   apt@cwi.nl			      bol@win.tue.nl

The use of negation in logic programming has been thoroughly studied
over the last 15 years. One of its interesting features is that it can
naturally support non-monotonic reasoning.  The aim of this tutorial is
to provide an overview of the main developments in the proof theory and
model theory of logic programming with negation, and on the relationship
between them. More specifically, we shall discuss the SLDNF- and
SLS-resolution procedures and their modification by means of tabulation,
and various 2-valued and 3-valued semantics, including Clark's
completion, stable model and well-founded semantics.


INVITED TUTORIAL 4

  Representing Knowledge in Extensions of Logic Programming Languages

			    Michael Gelfond

		      Computer Science Department
		     University of Texas at El Paso
		       mgelfond@cs.ep.utexas.edu

In this tutorial I'll describe some recent work aimed at the application
of declarative logic programming to knowledge representation.  This
includes a description of an extension of definite logic programs by
classical (explicit) negation, disjunction and modal operators and of
the semantics of this language.  We will also discuss a methodology of
the use of the language for representing various forms of commonsense
reasoning and mathematical properties of programs needed to support this
methodology.


LOCATION
========

The conference will be held aboard the ship "Marshal Koshevoi" which
will cruise on the Dnieper, starting and ending in Kiev, the capital of
the Ukraine.  Kiev has an international airport and is accessible by
most major international airlines.  All visitors will be required to
obtain a visa in advance of the trip; please contact a local embassy or
consulate.  It is recommended that visitors bring only US Dollars which
are widely accepted.  They should be exchanged to local currency in Kiev
only as needed.  Credit cards are only accepted at a few restaurants and
hotels in Kiev, and not on the ship.

The weather in the Kiev area in the middle of July should be pleasant,
with little rain and temperatures around 25 C (75 F).  Neither email nor
telephone contact will be available on board.  The ship will make daily
stops, with an excursion planned for the afternoon of Tuesday, July 19
in Zaporozhie.  The ship can be boarded any time between noon and
midnight on Saturday, July 16.  The ship returns to Kiev on Thursday,
July 21, but accomodation will still be booked until July 22.  The ship
must be deboarded by 11am on July 22.

The organizers will try to arrange for transportation from the airport
and train station to the dock.  If it is not available when you arrive
you should use only an official taxi.  The fare should be negotiated and
should be around 15 to 20 US Dollars.

In case of problems you can reach the local organizers, Anatoli
Degtyarev and Igor' Romanenko at (+7 044) 2663108 in Kiev.


SYSTEM DEMONSTRATIONS
=====================

Some PC's and possibly a Sun SparcStation will be available for system
demonstrations which will be arranged informally during the conference.
Please contact the local arrangements chair at voronkov@csd.uu.se for
further information.

INVITED TALK

		      Some Fundamental Principles
			 in Parallel Execution
		 of Logic and Constraint Logic Programs

			  Manuel Hermenegildo

			Facultad de Informatica
		   Universidad Politecnica de Madrid
			    herme@fi.upm.es

In this talk we attempt to view the parallel execution of logic
programming systems and concurrent logic programming systems, and their
respective generalization to constraint programming, from a new
perspective.  We propose a new way of studying these systems, based on a
particular definition of parallelism.  We argue that, under the given
assumptions, a large number of actual systems and models can be
classified and explained through the application, at different levels of
granularity, of only a few fundamental principles, such as:

 o independence, (also referred to as stability) which
   allows parallelism among non-deterministic threads,
 o determinacy, which allows parallelism among dependent threads,
 o non-failure, which allows guaranteeing non-speculativeness, and
 o granularity, which allows guaranteeing speedup in the
   presence of overheads.

Furthermore, we will argue, and support with examples, that this new
view allows easily transferring ideas across different proposals.  Also,
and based on the convergence of concepts that this view brings, we will
propose a unified approach to the implementation of all these parallel
systems by using a common abstract machine. We also propose a model --
the CIAO Model (Concurrent, Constraint, Independence-based
And-/Or-Parallel Model) -- as a driver for these ideas.


INVITED TALK

	  On Extensions of the Paradigm ``Proofs-as-Programs''
				   to
			    Classical Logic


			     Michel Parigot
			   Universite Paris 7
		       parigot@logique.jussieu.fr

After two decades of intensive studies of the computational aspects of
intuitionistic systems through the so-called Curry-Howard isomorphism,
relating intuitionistic proofs to functional programs, a new research
topic appeared in the last few years: the extension of this isomorphism
to classical proofs. The extension appeared both from logical and
programming considerations:

 o In the computational interpretations of intuitionistic logic, programs
   are represented by proofs and computation is represented by some kind of
   cut-elimination (or normalisation) procedure. The cut-elimination
   mechanism being also defined for classical logic, it was natural to
   consider it as a computation mechanism in this context too, and several
   such computational interpretations of classical logic have been
   proposed.

 o In functional programming languages, the purely functional character
   of programs appeared soon as an obstacle to practical programming.
   Functional programming languages have thus been enriched, in different
   ways, with control operators, like call/cc in Scheme. The theory of
   these control operators, lambda-C-calculus, has been made by Felleisen,
   and Griffin has remarked that they can be typed using some form of
   classical logic.

The new phenomenon which appears with this extension is some kind of
non-determinism: computational interpretations of classical logic seem
to lead directly to non-confluent calculi. There are at least two
different ways to tackle this phemomenon: either to try to avoid
non-confluence by chosing some appropriate confluent sub-calculus, or to
try to use non-confluence in order to build a new non-deterministic
computational model.

In this talk we intend to:
 o analyse the sources of non-confluence of the computational
   interpretations of classical logic;
 o compare different possible restrictions to confluent calculi (are
   some of them better than the others? do they significantly differ from
   those obtained by translations into intuitionistic logic?);
 o to discuss the meaning and the possible uses of the non-determinism
   associated to classcal proofs.

			The Anatomy of Vampire:
       New Directions in Efficient Implementation of Logical Inference

			    Andrei Voronkov

		      Computer Science Department
			 University of Uppsala
			   voronkov@csd.uu.se


We discuss an implementation technique, called code trees, for a class
of bottom-up procedures.  It is applicable to many procedures, including
resolution-based procedures, the inverse method, bottom-up evaluation of
logic programs and theorem proving methods which use lemmaizing.  Our
theorem prover Vampire implements several procedures as code trees.
Vampire is considerably faster than Otter, when both use the same
logical methods.

Code trees unify many ideas used in the implementation of logics, for
example abstract machines, indexing and binary decision diagrams.  It is
a general methodology rather than an ad hoc technique.  We show how the
consistent use of this methodology helped us in finding new indexing
schemes and in implementing bottom-up procedures on the ``set at a
time'' basis.
