17th OAGM Workshop and 4th International Workshop for Digital 
Image Processing and Computer Graphics

		Image Analysis and Synthesis

		June 2nd - 4th, 1993
		Graz, Austria

	First Announcement and Call for Papers
______________________________________



The Austrian Association for Pattern Recognition (VAGM, which is part of
the IAPR) in cooperation with the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the
Russian Academy of Sciences, and JOANNEUM RESEARCH invite you to 
participate in the 3 day Workshop on Digital Image Analysis and Synthesis. 

Papers devoted to new trends in image analysis and synthesis, including 
theory, algorithms, and applications are especially welcome. Topics of 
interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

*	image processing and analysis
*	perception engineering
*	pattern recognition
*	computer vision
*	parallel and hierarchical algorithms and architectures
*	neural networks
*	remote sensing
*	medical and biological applications
*	industrial applications
*	fuzzy logic theory and applications
*	active vision

General Information

Registration for the workshop will take place from June 2nd, 8:30 throughout 
the workshop to June 4th, 1993.

All papers must be received by February 15th, 1993, and application cards for 
participation and hotel accommodation must be received by May 1st, 1993.

The working language of the workshop will be English.

Invited Speakers

The invited speakers will be 

*	Professor Bruce Batchelor, of the University of Wales, College of
         Cardiff
*	Victor Soyfer, of the Institute for Aviation, Samara, Russia

Submission of Papers

Authors wishing to present a paper should submit a draft version and a 1000 
words abstract (for the book of abstracts) by February 15th, 1993. All papers 
must be submitted in English. Camera-ready-copies according to the VAGM style 
will be requested after the workshop. Proceedings will be prepared directly 
by offset printing from authors' manuscripts with no additional editorial 
processing or retyping.

A brochure of abstracts will be provided together with the conference 
material. The proceedings including all presented papers will be published 
after the conference.

The papers submitted will be reviewed by the programme committee, and the 
authors will receive a notification of acceptance of their papers. Invitation 
cards with a final programme and information about location and registration 
will be sent to the participants.


Participation Fee

There will be a small participation fee which covers participation in all
conference and workshop events, including the social programme and
refreshments. Hotel accomodation and meals will be paid for by the participants
at their own expense.


Special Sessions

Several special sessions will be organised around specific topics. So far the 
following sessions are planned:

*	industrial applications of image analysis and synthesis methods
	including system integration and tools

*	remote sensing, space applications and robotics

*	an international contact forum

*	image analysis tools

*	Mathematica-like image analysis tools   
To facilitate the comparison of new image analysis algorithms, this
special session is devoted to the presentation of implementations in
Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, etc. Prospective authors are requested to include
suitable input, output data, as well as the source code, as appendices to their
algorithm descriptions. This new form of presentation at a workshop should help
researchers to speed up the comparison of results, reduce duplication of
efforts, as well as provide learning tools for students.


International Contact Forum

Colleagues from neighbouring countries are invited to present the research 
activities of their own countries. This forum should establish international 
contact and facilitate the exchange of ideas.


OAGM Prize 

All presented contributions (including the oral presentation) will be 
reviewed by the prize committee and the authors of the best paper will be 
selected to receive the VAGM best-paper award.


The schedule will be:

15th February
