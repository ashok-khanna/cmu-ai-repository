			  Summer Institute on
	   Probabilistic Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence

			   Corvallis, Oregon
			   July 22 - 27, 1994


WHAT:

    An intensive short course in modern probabilistic modeling, Bayesian
    inference, and decision theory designed for advanced Phd students,
    recent Phds, and government and industry researchers.


WHY:

    In the last decade, researchers have made significant breakthroughs
    in techniques for representing and reasoning about uncertain
    information.  Many now feel that probabilistic reasoning and
    rational decision making provide a sound and practical foundation
    needed for a variety of problems in artificial intelligence.  In
    fact, these techniques now form the basis of state-of-the-art
    applications in search, planning, machine learning, diagnosis,
    vision, robotics, and speech understanding.

    The field has reached a level of maturity where the basic techniques
    are well understood and ready for dissemination.  At the same time,
    there is a wealth of potential applications and open research
    topics.  Thus, the time is ripe to train the next generation of
    researchers.


WHERE, WHEN, HOW:

    The first Summer Institute will be held at Oregon State University,
    Corvallis, Oregon from July 22-27, 1994.  A distinguished faculty
    will lecture on foundations or probabilistic reasoning and decision
    theory, knowledge acquisition, learning, and inference methods.
    Case studies will be presented on implemented applications.  The
    Institute will provide housing, and expects to be able to provide
    limited travel funds.

    The Institute is sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific
    Research.


WHO:

    Faculty Include:
    Jack Breese, Microsoft
    Wray Buntine, NASA Ames
    Bruce D'Ambrosio, Oregon State
    Thomas Dean, Brown
    Robert Fung, Lumina Decision Systems
    Othar Hansson, HRI & UC Berkeley
    David Heckerman, Microsoft
    Max Henrion, Lumina Decision Systems
    Keiji Kanazawa, UC Berkeley
    Tod Levitt, IET & Stanford
    Andrew Mayer, HRI & UC Berkeley
    Judea Pearl, UCLA
    Mark Peot, Stanford
    Ross Shachter, Stanford
    Michael Wellman, Univ. Michigan
    and others to be announced at a later date
