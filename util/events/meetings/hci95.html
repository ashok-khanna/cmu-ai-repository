The Conference
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is becoming essential in a wide
spectrum
of human activities, in many industries, offices, schools and daily
life.
HCI International '95 will provide a truly international forum for the
dissemination and exchange of scientific information on generic and
applied
areas of HCI.  This will be accomplished through plenary/demonstration
sessions,
tutorials and panels, all presented during the three-day conference.
 With this Call for Papers, we invite you to submit papers to HCI
International '95.
We hope that you will take this chance to join the first major
international
conference on human-computer interaction to be held in Japan.
Opportunities will
be provided to visit Japanese laboratories and development centers so
you can
discover for yourself the broad range of topics being examined.

Call for Proposals

All abstracts will be reviewed by three independent referees
from the program committee.

Technical papers: Technical papers can be presented in two formats;
verbal presentation or interactive presentation. Interactive
presentations are displayed in a booth. The Program Committee will
choose one of presentation formats considering the author's
preference.

Posters/Demonstrations: The poster session is designed for the
presentation
of late-breaking results and on-going research. Demonstrations are
designed
for work which can be more effectively presented via demonstration.
Equipment
needed for demonstrations is the responsibility of the author.

Tutorials: Tutorials describe recent work on significant topics
involving
human-computer interaction. Tutorial proposals should state the
objective,
content, target audience and include a biosketch about the presenter.

Panels: Each panel provides an opportunity for an exchange of views
among
panel members and the audience on a specific topic of human-computer
interaction.
A panel consists of presentations by the panelists and open
discussion.
Panel proposal should include title/author and an abstract of each
presentation,
a list of all panelists and chair.

About Pacifico YOKOHAMA
The Tokyo-Yokohama area is Japan's industrial, commercial, financial,
and cultural center. Pacifico YOKOHAMA, hotel, convention and
exhibition
complex, where HCI '95 will be held, is found in Minato Mirai 21, the
"future-port of the  21st century."
  With a bold outlook for the next century, Minato Mirai 21 - with its
many modern facilities built on a 186 hectare water-front site -
contributes to the development of the Tokyo-Yokohama area as an
appealing
new spot with the scenery of Yokohama port as its attractive backdrop.
