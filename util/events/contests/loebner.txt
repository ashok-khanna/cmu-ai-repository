CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:  TURING TEST, YEAR III
$100,000 LOEBNER PRIZE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
NEW YORK COMPUTER BUFF WINS 1992 CONTEST

Humans were pitted against computers once again on December 15th, 1992 in the
second annual search for the world's first "thinking" computer.  In the
contest, judges converse at computer terminals to try to determine which
terminals are controlled by people and which by computers.  The 1991 winning
program, Joseph Weintraub's "whimsical conversation," fooled 5 of 10 judges
into thinking it was a person.  His 1992 entry, "Men vs. Women," competing
against entries from around the country, won the December event by a narrow
margin.

The contest, named after benefactor Dr. Hugh G. Loebner of New York City, is
administered by the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies and will be hosted
in 1993 by National University in San Diego.  Dr. Robert Epstein, a professor
at both Boston University and National University, is in charge of the
contest.  Planning is handled by a committee of scientists and scholars from
MIT, Harvard, and other universities, chaired by distinguished philosopher
Daniel C. Dennett of Tufts University.  Dr. Daniel Bobrow of Xerox serves as
liaison to AAAI.

The contest was inspired by a paper published in 1950 by the brilliant English
mathematician, Alan Turing, one of the fathers of the modern computer.  The
tests so far are restricted, requiring computers to be conversant on only one
topic.

The designer of the 1992 winning entry received a bronze medal and a check for
$2,000 from the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies.  $100,000 will be
awarded when the winning program can pass an unrestricted test.  When that
happens, will we have the right to turn off the winning entry?  Who should get
the prize, the designer or the computer?  Could the winning program be
considered "intelligent" or "self-aware" or "conscious"?  At the 1992 event,
Weintraub's program fooled two of eight judges into thinking it was a person. 
But the human "confederates" -- hidden humans controlling some of the computer
terminals -- scored much higher on the average than all of the computers. 
Commented Epstein, "In natural conversation, computers are still vastly
inferior to people.  The grand prize is well out of reach at the moment."

For further information:  Complete transcripts and IBM-compatible diskettes
that play the 1991 and 1992 conversations in real-time may be ordered from
Rachael Thompson at the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies at 617-491-
9020 (fax: 1072).  Deadline for the receipt of 1993 submissions is November
1st.  If you have already submitted an entry this year, please resubmit at
this time.  Because of a fire that razed the Cambridge Center for Behavioral
Studies in July, most of the contest records were lost.  If you want to
participate this year, you must submit an updated application form.  The 1993
contest will be held in San Diego on Wednesday, December 8th, 1993
(participation is by modem).  Application materials may be obtained from the
Cambridge Center (617-491-9020, fax: 1072), or National University (619-563-
7144).  Refer technical questions to Dr. Robert Epstein, (619-436-4400 [CA],

			 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

		       FOURTH ANNUAL TURING TEST
			$2,000 & Bronze Medal

	1994 LOEBNER PRIZE COMPETITION IN ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE

Students, faculty, organizations, and companies are invited to submit 
computer entries for the Fourth Annual Loebner Prize Competition in
Artificial Ingelligence, to be held on Monday, December 12, 1994, in
San Diego. The prize is awarded annually to the best computer entry
in a modified Turing Test.  The Turing Test was proposed in 1950 by
British mathematician Alan M. Turing.  In the test, a human judge
interacts, via terminals, with humans and computers.  Based upon the
responses, the judge must decide which terminals are controlled by
computers and which are controlled by people.  If a computer cannot
be distinguished from a person in such a test, the computer might be 
said to be "thinking." 

In the 1993 event, held at GDE Systems in San Diego, all of the judges
were members of the national press, representating TIME Magazine,
Popular Science, PBS, the Voice of America, and elsewhere.  The contest
has drawn media attention around  world, including coverage on CNN
television, PBS television, the New York Times, the Washington Post,
the Wall Street Jouranl, and many periodicals in the computer field,
including Computer World and AI Magazine.  The competition, named after
benefactor Dr. Hugh G. Loebner of New York City, was founded by the
Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Cambridge, MA under the
guidance of scholars from MIT, Harvard University, Boston University,
Tufts University, and elsewhere, and has had funding from the National
Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Weingart
Foundation, IBM's Personal Computer Company, Apple Computer, Motorola,
and other companies.  Dr. Robert Epstein, Research Professor at National
University in San Diego, directs the events.

GUIDELINES FOR 1994:
Office rules and an application may be obtained by contacting:
		
		Dr. Robert Epstein, Contest Director
		1087 Wookdlake Drive
		Cardiff by the Sea, CA  92007-1009
		Tel: 619/436-4400; Fax: 619/436-4490
		Internet: repstein@nunic.nu.edu

The deadline for receipt of applications is November 1, 1994.  Applications
must be acompanied by printed protocols recording actual interaction between
the system to be entered and one or more humans.  The protocols may not
exceed ten double-spaced pages.  Applications must specify a single domain 
of discourse in which the computer system is proficient.  The domain must
be expressed by an English phrase containing no more than five words. Each
entry must communicate using approximations of natural English, and it must
be prepared to communicate for an indefinite period of time.  Computer 
entires may contain standard or customized hardware and software.  The
hardware may be of any type as long as it is inorganic and as long as its
replies are not controlled by humans responding in real time to the
judges' inputs.  Entrants must be prepared to interface their systems to
standard computer terminals over telephone lines at 2400 baud.  The prize
will be awarded if there is at least one entry.

ADVANCE NOTICE OF NEW GUIDELINES FOR 1995: 
The 1995 event will be an unrestricted Turing Test, requiring computer
entries to be able to converse for an indefinite period of time with no
topic restrictions.  In 1995, entries may be required to run on hardware
located at the competition site.  We welcome feedback from the AI community
regarding these and other methodological issues.

FOR FUTHER INFORMATION:  
Complete transcripts and IBM-compatible diskettes that play the 1991,
1992, and 1993 conversations in real-time are available for purchase. 
Sponsorship opportunities are available.  For further information about
any aspect of the event, contact Dr. Robert Epstein at the address above.
