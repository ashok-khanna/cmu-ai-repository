Following the plow of requests, here is the latest info on the next
BEAM Robot Games.

The Third BEAM Robot Games are scheduled for March 4-6th, 1994 at the
CNE Automotive Building in Toronto as part of the Canadian Home Hobby
show.  Those that have competed before or sent their Real-mail
addresses will receive flyers and details by Real mail.  For those that
wish further details, contact:


Canada First Inc.
797 Don Mills Road, 
Mony Life Building, 10th floor,
Don Mills, Ont.,
Canada
M3C-3S5

Phone: 416/696-5488
Fax:   416/696-7395


They will also be the contacts for the next rulebook, shirts, buttons
and upcoming videos.  They are, alas, not on Internet yet.  If you send
this company your real-mail address, you will get a detailed flyer on
or before Dec 93.  As well, they will have a booth at the fall home
Hobby show (Nov 5-7 at the Toronto International Centre) where the new
Guide will be sold or orders taken if the printers haven't delivered
yet.  The new BEAM Rules guide will include an expanded get-started
section, previous show dossier, where, how, and rule supplements.

The Automotive Building is a massive auditorium so hopefully we won't
run into space problems like we did at the Science Centre.  There is
consequently no limit to the size of robots allowed at this show,
provided it can be moved by truck.

Me, I'm off to Los Alamos NM to carry on my sinister Robotics research,
but I will be around for the games.

Is all.  See you there.
