Official Rules for the 8th Annual SFRSA Robot Competition
Event Sunday September 12 at the Exploratorium
Trial Runs at 10AM, Contests start at Noon, Awards at 4PM 

Three Major Contests this year, Rope Climbing, Maze, and Potato Peeling.
Due to space problems the Slalom will not be done this year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROPE CLIMBING CONTEST:

Your robot climbs a 1/4 inch #8 braided nylon rope to the ceiling of 
the Exploratorium. The ceiling is 11 meters high.

Scoring:
100 points if your robot makes it to the top.
100 points if your robot comes down by itself.
100 points if your robot uses a hand over hand latching mechanism.
100 points if your robot can be placed at least two feet from the dangling 
           free end of rope and can appoach and engage the rope on its own.
Up to 200  points calculated as 200 seconds minus the time to climb 
           up and down (and engage the rope if your robot does that).

This is a contest for mechanically inclined people. Computer and 
electronics are optional. No rockets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAZE CONTEST:

The maze will be more complex than last year. The aisle are 3 feet 
or wider and the walls aprx. 10 1/2 inch high.

Scoring:
Up to 200 points caluculated as 200 seconds minus time to escape from 
maze then divide by these autonomy factors:

         1 Autonomous with Sensors                   
         2 Dead Reckoning or Bump-Run
         3 Manual (Human control by radio or wire)

Extra 100 points If your robot can plug into the electrical outlet 
                 in the maze.
Extra 100 points If your robot can find a full closed coke can 
                 randomly placed on the floor of the maze and 
                 move it (by any means) out of the maze.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
POTATO PEELING:

Your robot arm takes an inexpensive peeler and deskins a potato.
The potato can be staged into any desirable position before the 
arm goes into action.

Scoring:
100 points if any peel what-so-ever is produced.
100 points if the potato is at least 50% peeled.
100 points if the potato is not turned or indexed to get the peeling.
100 points if the arm can do more than one potato.
100 points if the arm picks potatos out of a pile before peeling.

This event introduces the idea of arms into the hobby robot world.
As far as we know, no one has ever done this yet.
