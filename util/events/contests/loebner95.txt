LOEBNER PRIZE COMPETITION IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
 ANNOUNCEMENT OF, AND APPLICATION INFORMATION FOR, 
         THE 1995 PRIZE COMPETITION 
              (Rev 4/1995)

The Loebner Prize Medal and a cash award is awarded 
annually to the designer of the computer system that best 
succeeds in passing a variant of the Turing Test.  In 1995, 
$2,000 and a bronze medal will be awarded to the 
designer of the Most Human Computer if the median rank 
of that computer is below the overall median rank of all 
of the hidden human confederates in the contest.  The 
Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence was 
established in 1990 by Dr. Hugh Loebner and the 
Cambridge (Massachusetts) Center for Behavioral Studies.    

In accordance with the requirements of Dr. Loebner as 
published in the June 1994 Communications of the ACM,  
the winner of the Grand Prize must be prepared to deal 
with audio visual input (pattern recognition).  However, to 
celebrate the first unrestricted Turing Test, this rule 
will be waived for the 1995 contest only.  Should the 
median rank of a computer equal or exceed the overall 
median rank of the confederates -- in other words, should 
that computer prove to be indistinguishable from the 
typical human in the event -- the Grand Prize of $100,000 
and a gold medal will be awarded, and the contest will be 
discontinued.

The highest-ranking human confederate will receive an 
award for being the Most Human Human.

Applications for the 1995 competition must be 
postmarked by November 1, 1995.  Submissions will be 
evaluated and no more than eight finalists selected by 
November 21, 1995.  The 1995 finalists will compete in a 
simultaneous and real-time competition on Friday, 
December 15, 1995, in New York NY (date and location 
subject to change).

There is no entry fee.

Applications must be accompanied by printed or e-mail 
protocols recording interactions between the computer 
system to be entered and one or more human subjects.  
Protocols must not exceed ten typewritten double-spaced 
pages or 2,500 words.  Applications may be submitted by 
e-mail.  The Cambridge Center or the Prize Committee 
may request an opportunity to interact with  candidate 
programs.  Transcripts and scores from the 1991, 1992, 
1993, and 1994 competitions may be obtained by 
contacting the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies 
at 617-491-9020 (e-mail 76557.1175@compuserve.com).

============================================  
OFFICIAL RULES 
1995 LOEBNER PRIZE COMPETITION
IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
============================================

1.  The objective of the 1995 Loebner Prize Competition 
in Artificial Intelligence is to identify the computer 
system that can best succeed in passing a modern variant 
of the Turing Test. Judges will attempt to distinguish 
computer systems (referred to henceforward as 
"contestants") from human beings (referred to 
henceforward as "confederates" or "human confederates") 
based on interactions with these computer entries. 

2.  Applicants may be individuals, organizations, 
businesses, schools, corporations, institutions, or other 
entities.  Individuals need not have institutional 
affiliations.  Applicants may be of any nationality or age.  
Applicants may submit more than one entry during the 
same year, but a separate application must be completed 
for each entry.

3.  Employees, affiliates, and agents of the Cambridge 
Center for Behavioral Studies, Crown Industries, Inc., or 
of other official contest sponsors, as well as members of 
the families of such individuals, are not eligible to apply. 

4.  Applications for the 1995 Prize competition may be 
made on an official application form or facsimile or 
submitted by electronic mail.  Applications must be 
postmarked by November 1, 1995.  Applications should be 
submitted to: Dr. Hugh Loebner at the above address

5.   If there are two or more entries there will be a 
Loebner Prize contest. The medal and cash  award will go 
to the designer of the computer system with the highest 
median score, based on the ratings of the contest judges.  
Mean scores will be used only to break a tie. 

The Grand Prize of $100,000 and a gold medal will be 
awarded  to the designer  of the highest-ranking computer 
if the median  rank of that computer equals or exceeds 
the median rank of the hidden human confederates. 

If there is only one entry, Loebner Prize Medal and the 
$2000.00 cash award will be awarded to that entry.   If 
there are no entries in the 1995 Loebner Prize 
Competition, the $2000.00 cash prize will be added to the 
cash award for 1996, making the award for 1996 
$4000.00.

6.  It is the task of the computer entries to respond to the 
communications of the judges in such a manner as to 
imitate the responses of a human.  No constraints will be 
placed on the judges' communications.  Entries must be 
prepared to communicate for an indefinite period of time.

7.  Computer entries may contain standard or customized 
software and hardware.  The hardware may be of any type 
as long as it is inorganic and as long as its replies are in 
no manner controlled by human beings or other organic 
systems in real time.

8.  Entries will be required to run on hardware located at 
the competition site.  NO TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL BE 
PERMITTED.  Finalists chosen to participate may submit 
their entries as programs recorded on standard machine 
readable media (magnetic or optical storage) together 
with operating documentation.  Macintosh and IBM 
compatible computers with standard mass storage 
peripherals will be available on-site for the contest.  
Efforts will be made to secure the use of other standard 
computers such as workstations, but this can not be 
guaranteed. Entrants requiring non-standard hardware 
will be required to provide that hardware for operation at 
the contest site. Personnel will be prepared to operate 
the computer entries according to documentation 
providedby the contestant.
 
9.  Appropriate steps will be taken to prevent the 
unauthorized duplication or publication of contestants' 
entries, however neither the Cambridge Center, the Prize 
Committee, nor any of their agents can guarantee 
absolute security.  Contestants, by entering this contest, 
imply their understanding of this and agree to hold the 
Cambridge Center, the Prize Committee and their agents 
harmless should there be any unauthorized duplication or 
publication of programs. Entrants who wish absolute 
security will be allowed to to operate their entries 
and/or provide their own hardware on site.   

10.  Computer entries will be required to record the 
conversations as text files on magnetic media.  
Information regarding the file format will be available 
after April 1, 1995 from the Contest Director. The 
recordings will remain the property of the Cambridge 
Center, which will also retain the copyright on 
transcripts or other representations, magnetic or 
otherwise, of the recordings.

11.  Applications must be accompanied by printed 
protocols or e-mail transcripts recording actual  
interactions between the system to be entered and one or 
more human beings.  The protocols may not exceed ten 
double-spaced typewritten pages or 2,500 words.

12.  The selection process may entail interaction between 
selection personnel and computer entries.   Applicants 
will be notified of the selection decision by November 21, 
1995.  No more than eight entries will be selected as 
finalists to compete in a real- time and simultaneous 
contest to be held in New York, NY,  on Friday, December 
15, 1995 (date and location subject to change).

13.  Judges and human confederates for the 1995 
competition will be selected who have no prior knowledge 
of any of the contestants or human confederates.

14.  Judges will have one or more opportunities to 
interact with each of the computer terminals available 
concurrently during the contest.  Judges will be allowed 
unrestricted communications.  They will be informed that 
at least two of the terminals are  controlled by human 
confederates and that at least two of the terminals are 
controlled by computers.

15.  One or more referees may be present to limit 
communications of the confederates.

16.  Judges will not be allowed to interact with each 
other and will be instructed to provide individual ratings 
of each of the appropriateness and responsiveness of the 
replies.

17.  The names "Loebner Prize" and "Loebner Prize 
Competition" may be used by contestants in advertising 
only by advance written permission of the Cambridge 
Center, and their use may be subject to applicable 
licensing fees.  Advertising is subject to approval by 
representatives of the Loebner Prize Competition. 
Improper or misleading advertising may result in 
revocation of the prize and/or other actions.

18.  Computer programs must communicate in the English
language.

Data Entry, File Format, and Hardware Specifications

1.  KEY ENTRY - TERMINAL DISPLAY:

 a. The key sequence @,@,nn,<CR>,<CR> (nn=00-99) when entered will
indicate that a new judge, Judge nn, is now entering data. Each judge
will thus identify himself/herself when moving to a new terminal.

 b. Judges' questions and comments can be multiline.  Each question or
comment will be entered one line at a time.  Each line will be terminated by
a carriage return <CR>.Judges will key in questions and comments in response
to a ">" prompt from the program.

 c. The computer will prompt the judge with a ">" character and then 
echo on the screen, character by character, the judge's entry.

 d. Entry of two consectutive carriage returns will indicate that the
judge's question or comment is complete and that the terminal (program or
human) must respond. 

 e. The terminal will display character data in a monotype font (all
characters of equal width).

EXAMPLE
Assume program is responding to current interaction with Judge 3

[some program comment-completed]
>@@04<CR>                            ( New Judge, number 4           )
><CR>                                ( two lines required            )
Welcome judge 4                      ( Comment by program (or human) )
> Do you think that the<CR>          ( Multiline question from judge4)
> Republicans can succeed<CR>        ( question continued  line 2    )
> in winning the White House?<CR>    ( question ended  (first <CR>)  )
> <CR>                               ( second <CR>                   )
Only if Newt succeeds in             ( Answer, line 1                )
developing a more tolerant image.    ( Answer, line 2                )
>_                                   ( ">" prompt - judge to respond )
 ^ Cursor waits for input

---------------------------  
                    
2. DATA FILE FORMAT
Intent: Each program entered in the Loebner Prize Contest will produce a
text file transcript of the interactions with judges.  The file should be
readable by standard text reader programs.   

 a. Each computer entry in the 1995 Loebner Prize Contest 
shall create a text file on 3.5" diskette containing the transcript of
keyboard input and program output.

 b. The file will named LP95-nn.TXT eg LP95-01.TXT.  The nn (00 -> 99)
allows a program to record multiple executions on a single disk.  That is,
the first execution will write LP95-01.TXT to the diskette.  The second
execution will write LP95-02.TXT, etc.  It is the responsibility of the
program to determine the appropriate cycle (nn).

 c. The file will be in ASCII text format suitable for input into a
standard word processing program.

 d. The first three lines are headers containing the following:

(c)1995 Cambridge Center For Behavioral Studies all rights reserved
<Program Name> <Contestant Name>
Start at: <YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS >

 e. Each succeeding line will EITHER mirror one line displayed
on the screen, preceeded by the source "JUDGEnn" or "PROGRAM" and
time in brackets OR indicate a change of judges:"*** JUDGEnn ***"

eg: For the above interaction:

*** JUDGE04 ***
PROGRAM[14:12:25]Welcome judge 4
JUDGE04[14:12:32]Do you think that the
JUDGE04[14:12:39]Republicans can succeed
JUDGE04[14:12:55]In winning the White House?
PROGRAM[14:13:15]Only if Newt succeeds in
PROGRAM[14:13:17]developing a more tolerant image

-------------------------------
3. HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS

Intent: Computers under control of a program may access disc drives,
CD Roms, or other peripherals in a distinctive manner, thereby providing
visual and/or auditory clues  In order to eliminate such clues, computer
bodies and peripherals will be screened from judges.  However, monitors
and keyboards will be on judges' side of the sceens.  Therefore, the
following rule:

 a.  Monitor and keyboard cables will be at least 1.5 Meters long.
