   INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, INC.

         ***   Call for Nominations for IJCAI-95 Awards   *** 

THE IJCAI AWARD FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE

The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given at an IJCAI to a
scientist who has carried out a program of research of consistently
high quality yielding several substantial results.  If the research
program has been carried out collaboratively, the Award may be made
jointly to the research team.  Past recipients of this award are
John McCarthy (1985), Allen Newell (1989), Marvin Minsky (1991), and
Ray Reiter (1993).

The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of US$ 2,000
plus travel and living expenses for the IJCAI. The recipient will
be invited to deliver an address on the nature and significance of
the results achieved and write a paper for the conference proceedings.
Primarily, however, the Award carries the honour of having one's
work selected by one's peers as an exemplar of sustained research
in Artificial Intelligence.

We hereby call for nominations for The IJCAI Award for Research
Excellence, which will be presented at IJCAI-95 in Montreal, Canada,
20 August - 25 August 1995.  The accompanying note on Selection
Procedures provides the relevant details.


THE COMPUTERS AND THOUGHT AWARD

The Computers and Thought Lectures are presented at IJCAI conferences
by outstanding young scientists in the field of Artificial
Intelligence.  Past recipients of this honour have been Terry
Winograd (1971), Patrick Winston (1973), Chuck Rieger (1975),
Douglas Lenat (1977), David Marr (1979), Gerald Sussman (1981),
Tom Mitchell (1983), Hector Levesque (1985), Johan de Kleer (1987),
Henry Kautz (1989), Rodney Brooks (1991), Martha Pollack (1991),
and Hiroaki Kitano (1993).

The Award carries with it a certificate and the sum of US$ 2,000 plus
travel and living expenses for the IJCAI.  The lecture is given one
evening during the conference, and the public is invited to attend.
The lecturer is encouraged to publish the lecture in the conference
proceedings.  The lectureship was established with royalties received
from the book Computers and Thought, edited by Edward Feigenbaum and
Julian Feldman; it is currently supported by income from IJCAII funds.

We hereby call for nominations for the Computers and Thought Award,
which will be presented at IJCAI-95 in Montreal, Canada, 20 August -
25 August 1995.  The accompanying note on Selection Procedures
provides the relevant details.



SELECTION PROCEDURES FOR IJCAI AWARDS

Nominations for the IJCAI Research Excellence Award and the Computers
and Thought Award are invited from everyone in the international
Artificial Intelligence community.

There should be a nominator and a seconder, at least one of whom
must not be from the same institution as the nominee.  Nominees for
the Computers and Thought Award cannot be older than 35 at the start
of the conference.  There are no other restrictions on nominees,
nominators or seconders.  Nominating and seconding statements for an
award should be submitted on the Nomination and Reference Forms for
the award.  The forms are available via http, gopher, or anonymous FTP

An IJCAI Awards Committee has been established to encourage high
quality nominations for IJCAI Awards and to propose winners to the
Board of Trustees.  It consists of five members: the three most recent
past IJCAI conference chairs (Wolfgang Bibel (convenor), Barbara Grosz
and Wolfgang Wahlster), and two senior members of the AI community.
The IJCAI Awards Committee will be advised by the IJCAI Award Review
Committee, which is the union of the former Trustees of IJCAII, the
Advisory Committee of IJCAI-95, the program chairs of the last three
IJCAI conferences, and the past recipients of the IJCAI Award for
Research Excellence and the IJCAI Distinguished Service Award, with
nominees excluded.

Nominations should be sent to the Conference Chair for IJCAI-95 at
the address below. The deadline for nominations is 25 November 1994.
To avoid duplication of effort, nominators are requested to submit
the name of the person they are nominating by 1 November 1994 so that
people who propose to nominate the same individual may be so informed
and can coordinate their efforts.
