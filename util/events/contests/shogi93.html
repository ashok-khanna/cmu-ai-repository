The following is the announcement of the Fourth (1993) Computer
Shogi Championship Tournament. Shogi is Japanese chess. A noticeable 
difference between Shogi and western chess is that in Shogi a player 
can reuse pieces which he captured from his opponent. A branching
factor in the end game of Shogi is usually over 100, sometimes over
300. The search space of Shogi is over 200th power of 10 (that of
chess is about 120th power of 10). So brute-force approach cannot be
applied.

If you are interested, please contact Prof.Takizawa or me.
