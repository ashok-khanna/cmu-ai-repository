SRI International (Menlo Park, CA) is currently seeking a fulltime
software engineer to participate in the evolution of the Open Agent
Architecture (OAA)*, and the development of systems based on OAA.
OAA, a research effort of SRI's Artificial Intelligence Center, is a
paradigm and framework for constructing systems that coordinate the
efforts of distributed, autonomous software agents.  Additional
information regarding OAA can be found on the OAA home page at
http://www.ai.sri.com/~oaa.

This position calls for a versatile programmer who is comfortable
working in a variety of programming environments, enjoys learning and
defining new concepts, is adept at conceptualizing and communicating
elements of system design, and can follow through on implementation
with minimum supervision.

Applicants should have, as a minimum, either an M.S. in Computer
Science, or a B.S.  with significant experience.  Experience with
several of the following languages is expected: C, C++, JAVA, Prolog,
Delphi, Visual Basic, Lisp.  Although not required, some background or
experience in the following areas is also desirable: artificial
intelligence; intelligent user interfaces; programming under Microsoft
Windows or NT; UNIX system programming.  Applicants who anticipate
completion of a degree this spring may be considered for a summer
start date.

[Note: Although Prolog isn't a hard requirement, we are posting to
 ai+prolog-jobs for two reasons: (1) OAA's Interagent Communication
 Language is in many ways based on Prolog, and a good deal of our
 coding is done in Prolog; (2) As an AI research group, there is a
 healthy tradition of Prolog use, in other projects as well as OAA.]

SRI International is one of the world's largest contract research firms. 
We were founded in 1946 in conjunction with Stanford University as the
Stanford Research Institute and later became fully independent as SRI
International.  As with many other divisions of SRI, the Artificial
Intelligence Center has played a prominent role in the development
of its field.

Applicants may submit resumes or inquiries by email or U.S. Mail to:

David Martin
Room EJ219
Artificial Intelligence Center
SRI International
333 Ravenswood Ave.
Menlo Park, CA 94025
U.S.A.
