You may have noticed a slight change in the moderation of the
AI-related jobs mailing lists. Previously, all job postings had to go
through me, resulting in the posts arriving in spurts.

Last week I sent out the enclosed email message to everybody who had
submitted an approved job posting within the last year (more than 600
companies). From now on, I'm assuming that any company that submitted
a valid post in the past is responsible enough to submit only valid
posts in the future. The moderation program now transmits posts from
people on the approved list without requiring human intervention. The
mailing list will still kick out obviously misdirected subscription
requests from these people.

The net result is less work for me, and more timely job postings for you.

Greetings,

Sometime during the past year, a job announcement, postdoc announcement, or
predoctoral studentship announcement relating to Artificial Intelligence,
Lisp, or Prolog was either posted by you to one of the following mailing
lists, or was forwarded by a third party to one of these mailing lists:

    AI-Jobs		ai+ai-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    Lisp-Jobs		ai+lisp-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    Prolog-Jobs		ai+prolog-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    AI-Postdoc		ai+ai-postdoc@cs.cmu.edu
    AI-Predoc		ai+ai-predoc@cs.cmu.edu

The purpose of this email message is to provide you with information about
these mailing lists and the requirements for submitting an announcement to
one or more of these lists. My apologies if you receive multiple copies of
this message.

Best regards,

Mark Kantrowitz
mkant@cs.cmu.edu


PURPOSE OF THE LISTS

These mailing lists exist to help programmers, researchers, and students
find AI, Lisp, and Prolog programming and research positions, and to help
companies with AI, Lisp, and Prolog programming and research positions to
find capable AI, Lisp, and Prolog programmers, researchers, and students.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

These mailing lists are moderated. Announcements not meeting the following
requirements will be rejected:

   1. Material appropriate for these job mailing lists include AI, Lisp,
      and Prolog job announcements and AI predoctoral and postdoctoral
      fellowships. 

   2. All announcements must be of genuine positions. Resumes and
      discussion are not permitted. 

   3. The postings must be directly related to the purpose of the list. 
      For example, a C++ job announcement should not be sent to the AI-Jobs
      mailing list unless the position requires significant AI expertise.
      AI expertise must not be merely "desirable", but a specific job
      requirement.  

   4. Cross-posting between the various AI job lists is permitted, provided
      the post is clearly germaine to each list.

   5. Churning is not permitted. You may post the same job announcement
      no more than once a month. If there was a significant error in a 
      previous job announcement, you may repost a corrected copy. The
      post should indicate that it is a corrected copy near the top of
      the announcement and should summarize the corrected information.

   5. ** SUBJECT LINE FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS **

      The goal of the Subject line formatting requirements is to provide
      enough information in a single line to enable the mailing list
      subscribers to decide whether to read further. The subject line
      formatting requirements are as follows,

          Type: Description at Company (Location)

      where 

         -  Type is "Job", "Fellowship", "Postdoc", "Internship",
            "Lectureship", or something similar.

         -  Description is a short description of the job, such as a list
            of relevant AI fields (e.g., "NLP", "Robotics", etc.)

         -  Company is the name of the company offering the position.
            If you are a recruiter, please add "[Recruiter]" after
            the company name.

         -  Location is the location of the position. 

      For example, a Speech Recognition postdoctoral appointment at CMU
      would have the following subject line

        Postdoc: Speech Recognition at Carnegie Mellon Univ. (Pittsburgh, PA)

      and an expert systems position at Gensym might have the 
      following subject line

        Job: Real-Time Expert Systems, Lisp at Gensym (Cambridge, MA)


   6. Body formatting requirements:

      Please use a line-length of no more than 78 characters.


ARCHIVAL

Job postings sent to these lists are automatically archived in appropriate
subdirectories of
   ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/jobs/
The AI-related Job Posting Archives web page maintains links to the most
recent three months of job postings at the URL
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/other/jobs.html


FINDERS FEES

We do not accept finders fees for any jobs filled as a result of a posting
to these mailing lists. If you must give a finders fee to someone, we ask
that you donate it to the Free Software Foundation (675 Massachusetts
Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; 1-617-876-3296; gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu).
These mailing lists are not affiliated with the Free Software Foundation;
we just like what they do.

If a position was filled as a result of a posting to these lists, we would
appreciate hearing about it. This isn't a requirement, just a courtesy
request. It lets us know that these lists are performing a worthwhile
service, and gives us a warm fuzzy feeling inside.

Questions about these lists may be directed to ai+@cs.cmu.edu.
