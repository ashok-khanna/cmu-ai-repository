		  NEW POSITIONS IN IC-PARC

			 28 May 1997

IC-Parc has recently secured funding for 4 new positions,
which it proposes to fill as soon as possible. All the
positions lie in the area of constraint programming and
its application to large scale industrial problems. The
main focus is on resource management and planning. The
industrial sectors are construction, retailing,
telecommunications and oil.

Candidates should have a solid background in one or more
of the paradigms covered by constraint programming, e.g.
constraint logic programming, stochastic algorithms,
mathematical programming. They should also have some
experience of solving large combinatorial optimisation
problems. The programming environment currently used in
IC-Parc, both for research and for applications
development, is the ECLiPSe platform.

Candidates will be expected to participate both in
developing applications software and in advancing the
basic research agenda. The balance will be determined

The appointments will be for 2 years in the first
instance, and will be renewable subject to satisfactory
performance and available funding. Candidates will be
expected to have a PhD or extensive industrial experience.
Salary will be in the range 20-30K pounds, depending upon
experience. In addition, the Centre operates a scheme of
bonus payments.

Enquiries and applications should be directed to either
Professor Barry Richards or Dr Mark Wallace at IC-Parc.
