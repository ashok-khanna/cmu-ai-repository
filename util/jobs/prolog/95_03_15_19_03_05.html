Harmonix Corp -- as previously posted -- is actively recruiting for
several key positions to prepare for the upcoming release of its
behavioral synthesis software product.  We have several opportunities
for you to join our rapidly growing company.

			SOFTWARE ENGINEERS

We need top-notch software engineers to work on the enhancement of
our product's graphical user interface and its simulation, synthesis
and optimization kernels. Most software engineering work is done at
our offices in Woburn, Massachusetts but location at a remote site
is possible.

The software that we are developing is written in C, C++ and
Prolog. Major individual programs range in size from about forty
thousand to a few hundred thousand lines of code. Development work is
done primarily on Sun workstations. Successful candidates for software
engineering positions at Harmonix must be able to be immediately
productive. This will require that applicants be experienced in doing
development in a Unix environment, have experience in multi-person
development projects and have a thorough understanding of
object-oriented development.
