The physics ITS group of CIRCLE (http://www.pitt.edu/~circle) has
immediate openings for 5 full-time AI programmer/analysts.  These
positions all involve developing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for
helping college students learn physics.   In particular, the group is
building Andes (teaches quantitative problem solving), Atlas (uses
natural language to teach principles in the context of quantitative
problem solving) and Why2000 (teaches qualitative physics using natural
language).

These positions involve developing artificial intelligence (AI)
programs. Knowledge of a typical AI system development language is
essential (e.g. C++, Java, Lisp, Prolog, or Clips); knowledge of AI,
college physics, and/or computational linguistics and experience in
developing large software systems in a team are pluses.  Opportunities
abound in these positions for increasing one's knowledge of AI, and in
particular, for learning about the exciting new technologies that power
our third-generation intelligent tutoring systems.

All 5 positions are full-time, permanent positions with full benefits.
The positions are funded from research contracts lasting until April
2003, although it is likely that funding will continue for many years
thereafter.  The positions are located  in the Learning Research and
Development Center (LRDC) at the University of Pittsburgh.  The ITS
group is directed by Prof. Kurt Vanlehn (http://www.pitt.edu/~vanlehn).

If interested, please send a vita to: vanlehn@cs.pitt.edu or Prof. Kurt
VanLehn, LRDC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.   The
University of Pittsburgh is an equal opportunity, affirmative action
employer.
