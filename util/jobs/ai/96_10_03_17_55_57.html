If you are a top flight virtual reality and scientific visualization
programmer interested in designing and building interfaces for robots
in space, please send an ascii form of your resume or CV to 
management@artemis.arc.nasa.gov.

The Intelligent Mechanisms Group of the NASA Ames research center
develops innovative, new interfaces to visualize robots operating 
in remote environments and to represent and understand the scientific 
data that these robots collect.  Past projects have included 
controlling robots in Mt. Spurr, Alaska, under the Antarctic ice, and 
across Hawaii.  We are presently developing systems for robots to fly 
in Space, with the Space Shuttle, to the Moon, and to Mars.

This work requires a small group of imaginative, technically gifted 
over-achievers.  We are specifically interested in learning about people 
who have written virtual reality graphical user interfaces for complex 
systems.  Demonstrated creative accomplishments, graphics programming 
skills and experience writing software for large projects is a plus.

Programmers with programming experience in C, C++, Unix/IRIX, Performer, 
Inventor, VRML, image processing, robotics and artificial intelligence
on Silicon Graphics platforms are strongly preferred.

We look forward to hearing from you.
