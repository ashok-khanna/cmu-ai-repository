University of Oregon
Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory
Research Associate Positions

The Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory (CIRL)
of the University of Oregon anticipates having two openings
for research faculty, subject to availability of funding,
and invites applications.   These positions can be at the
research associate or senior research associate level.
The starting date is flexible, with a preference for early
availability.   

Research at CIRL focuses on basic questions in artificial
intelligence.  Current areas of research include knowledge
representation, search, constraint satisfaction, planning
and scheduling.  CIRL is located in the Riverfront Research
Park in Eugene, Oregon.  There are currently 3 faculty and 4
associated graduate students.

The first position requires demonstrated research excellence
in areas that overlap with or complement current research at
CIRL, as described above.  Evaluation will be based on the
quality of prior research, and the potential for productive
collaboration at CIRL.

The second position will involve doing the research and
development necessary to help extend CIRL technologies to 
practical applications.  This person must be able to make
contacts in industry, and coordinate technology transfer
efforts.  Evaluation will be based on relevant experience.

A Ph.D. is required for either position, although not
necessarily in Artificial Intelligence or Computer Science.
Teaching opportunities and supervision of graduate students 
may be available, but teaching is not required.

Salaries will be commensurate with experience.  Although
contracts are annual, these positions are intended to be
permanent, subject to availability of funds.  Depending on
funding, we may postpone filling one of these positions; in
that case, the strongest candidate will be hired, and the
other position postponed.

Applications will be accepted until October 4, 1996.
Qualified applicants should submit a current curriculum
vitae, a list of references, and at most one sample
paper to:

David Etherington, Director 
CIRL 
1269 University of Oregon 
Eugene, OR 97403-1269

For additional information, see: http://www.cirl.uoregon.edu/
or send e-mail to laurieb@cirl.uoregon.edu.

CIRL is committed to diversity both within our laboratory
and across the university. Although quality of the
candidate is the final determining factor, extra and
positive consideration will be given to applicants from
underrepresented groups.

The University of Oregon is an equal opportunity,
affirmative action institution committed to cultural
diversity and compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
