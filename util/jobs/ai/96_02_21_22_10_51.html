NASA Ames AI/SE Computer Scientist for Automatic Programming Project

Job Description and Requirements:

NASA Ames is seeking a computer scientist with a background in
automated reasoning and/or formal methods, with an interest in
software engineering applications.  PhD or advanced research
experience is highly desirable. The job is to participate in
project-oriented research, technology development, and application
development.  Initial responsibilities will be commensurate with
education and experience. The objective of the project is to develop
technology for next-generation automatic programming systems and
advanced software verification and validation systems using formal
methods. This is an ongoing project under the leadership of Dr.
Michael Lowry.

This position is full-time and long-term with significant growth
potential. The initial responsibilities and salary are well suited to
candidates with a recent PhD, or one obtained within the last ten
years. The ideal candidate will have skills both in basic research and
application development, and be able to fluidly use both in
leading-edge projects. Interpersonal and communication skills, both
verbal and written, are also important.

The project is oriented to strategic research - that is, focused
research whose target is the 5 to 15 year application time
horizon. Strategic research differs from applied research in this
extended time horizon- the objective is to develop fundamentally new
technology, rather than just apply existing technology. Strategic
research also differs from pure basic research in being focused,
project-oriented, and team-oriented.

This position is available immediately.  US citizenship or green card
status is preferred. The bulk of the work will be performed on site at
NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley (the south San Francisco
bay area). The job also entails travel to other NASA centers.

Background:

The goal of the Amphion project is to make knowledge-based software
engineering (KBSE) a reality for NASA. KBSE uses techniques from
artificial intelligence and formal methods to raise the level at which
users program to the specification level (what is the problem to be
solved) rather than the detailed code level (how to solve a problem). 
Programs are generated automatically from specifications. The Amphion
project is a pioneer in the real-world use of deductive synthesis
for program synthesis. In deductive synthesis, a program and its 
proof of correctness are generated concurrently through automatic
theorem proving.

The Amphion project has developed a number of application-oriented
automatic programming systems. The project is now aiming toward the
development of the Meta-Amphion system - a suite of generic tools for
developing automatic programming systems.  Initial research toward
this goal won the best paper award at the KBSE'95 conference.

In the future, the project will also be developing technology for
validation and verification of intelligent autonomous systems, such as
the next generation deep-space satellites (i.e., NASA's New Millennium
initiative).

To apply:

Please send an electronic copy of a cover-letter and resume
or curriculum vitae (ASCII or Postscript) to

        lowry@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov

Please include names and contact information for references, a description
of previous research project and/or application development experience,
and one or two recent papers (Postscript format preferred. Microsoft RTF,
Framemaker MIF, or LaTex format acceptable only if files are completely
standard and cross-platform compatible.)

If you are unable to send email, a hardcopy of this information can be 
mailed to:

Dr. Michael Lowry
MS 269-2
NASA Ames Research Center
Moffett Field, CA 94035

Preliminary interviews will be held either by telephone or
in the Silicon Valley area.
