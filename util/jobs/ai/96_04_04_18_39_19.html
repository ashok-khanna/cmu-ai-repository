Employment Opportunities in Artificial Intelligence at JPL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Artificial Intelligence Group and the Machine Learning Systems Group at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology are
seeking candidates at the BA/BS, MA/MS and PhD level to work on fundamental
research problems leading to unique software applications in spacecraft
autonomy, scientific data analysis, and mission operations automation.

Openings in the following areas of artificial intelligence research and
development exist: planning & scheduling, intelligent systems monitoring and
diagnosis, machine learning / data mining, and pattern recognition / image
understanding. Responsibilities for these openings range from research
program development to software design and coding.

Candidates must hold a degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or
a related area, and must possess programming skills in C and/or LISP, as
well as have some experience with the UNIX environment. Ideally, in addition
to a background in artificial intelligence, a candidate would also have a
background in one or more of the following areas: statistics, applied
mathematics, signal processing, operations research, economics, or image
processing.

Some of the new application targets for AI-based software onboard spacecraft
include mission planning and resource management, adaptive feature detection
for science, fault management, artificial economies, and agent-based
architectures. Some ongoing applications include automated planning of image
analysis for the Galileo mission to Jupiter, automated procedure generation
for the Deep Space Network, automated anomaly detection in Space Shuttle
telemetry, automated sky object catalog generation from Mt. Palomar
Observatory data, and automated volcano detection in Venus
synthetic-aperture radar images returned by the Magellan spacecraft. This
work has generated new research results on the path towards unprecedented AI
applications.

If you are interested in applying for one of these positions, please send a
resume and any other supporting materials to the address below (electronic
submission of resumes encouraged). Please include an e-mail address and
phone number at which you can be reached. Recent graduates are strongly
encouraged to apply. Please include information on your citizenship status
with your application.
