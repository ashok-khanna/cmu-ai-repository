Hello, my name is Dave Staats.  I am a Certified Personnel Consultant
with 10 years of experience in Aerospace and Electronics.  I am currently
working to fill a number of openings with two leading U.S. companies
involved in artificial intelligence and expert systems.

If you are open to exploring new opportunities now (or in the next year
for that matter), please call or e-mail me so that we can establish our
relationship.

Please note that in most cases, U.S. citizenship will be required.

We also have positions available in distributed processing, embedded
processing, OO/RDBMS, large scale software system integration and other
advanced techynology engineering disciplines.

Please forward this message to anyone it may help.  Thank you for taking
