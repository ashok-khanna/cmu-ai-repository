                      AND SIMULATION SYSTEMS


Applications are invited from postgraduate computer scientists with research
experience in software-engineering, human-computer interaction, or knowledge
based systems. The research associateship is funded by Engineering and Physi=
cal
Sciences Research Council and Northern Electric Distribution Ltd and is

simulating electrical power supply networks and strategic planners whose
knowledge is focussed on financial, managerial and customer service issues.
The project will also involve EA Technology Ltd as supplier of the network
simulation tools. Particular expertise in case-based reasoning would
be most welcome. The salary will be in the 1A scale between =A314,317 and
