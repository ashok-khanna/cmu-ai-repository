The Operations Scheduling group at NASA Ames Research Center requests a
summer graduate student from June 1st to September 1st to participate in
the implementation of the New Millenium/Deep Space-1 (DS-1) Planner &
Scheduler. DS-1 will be NASA's first autonomous spacecraft for
interplanetary missions with cutting edge technology on board the
spacecraft. This is an opportunity to join a well-motivated,
hard-working team, and the chance to directly impact the future of the
US space program. This is a collaborative work with scientists at JPL
and CMU. NASA Ames is strategically located in the heart of the Silicon
Valley at Moffett Field, near Mountain View, CA.

Ideal candidates will be in an advanced stage of their Masters or in a
Ph.D programme with very good C++ programming skills with knowledge of
LISP and VxWorks a definite advantage. Good written and verbal skills
are a must. Candidates should be familiar with search techniques,
constraint propagation, operations research, planning and
scheduling. Motivation to learn quickly about the previous topics is a
definite requirement.

Applicants should send a resume with 2 recommendations electronically
to:

Dr. Nicola Muscettola	(mus@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov)

at the earliest.
