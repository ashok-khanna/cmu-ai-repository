  Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza Artificiale
  (IDSIA) in beautiful Lugano (Switzerland) is starting up
  research projects in (1) reinforcement learning and evolutionary
  computation, and (2) supervised and unsupervised neural nets.

  We offer research positions at various levels (beginning now):

  1. 1 postdoc or up to 2 PhD students,

  2. A few undergrad students.

  The initial contracts will last until the end of this year,
  with a possible extension of 2 more years.  Temporary visits
  (for a few months) by visiting researchers/students are also
  possible.

  Send CV, list of publications (if applicable), brief statement of
  research interests, and names/email addresses of references to:

    juergen@idsia.ch

  Postscript preferred.
  DEADLINE: March 31 1995.
  Earlier applications preferred.

  A significant part of the initial research will focus on the
  ``incremental self-improvement paradigm'' described in paper 1.
