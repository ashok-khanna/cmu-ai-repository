JOB OPPORTUNITIES AT NICI, NIJMEGEN UNIVERSITY

POSTDOC / COGNITIVE SCIENTIST
Vacancy 21.1.00

A position is available for an experienced Postdoc researcher in 
music cognition for a project on categorical rhythm perception. We 
are looking for a cognitive scientist with experience in empirical 
methods and in modeling music perception processes, preferably in 
Lisp. An affinity with the domain of rhythm, tempo, timing and 
musical expression is preferred. Appointment will be full-time or 
8/10 for two years. Depending on experience, the salary will be 
between Dfl. 4110,-- and Dfl. 8682,-- gross per month on full-time 
basis.

COMPUTER SCIENTIST / LISP PROGRAMMER
Vacancy 21.2.00

A challenging position is available for a Computer 
Scientist/programmer with experience in Common Lisp and CLOS. 
Knowledge of the Macintosh OS, MCL, MIDI and audio applications is an 
advantage. He/she will work on the development of models, tools and 
demonstration programs for computational modeling of music cognition 
and will need an open and helpful attitude to the other members of 
the team. In our environment, next to Lisp-only applications, MCL is 
used to control other applications via AppleScript. We are not 
looking for a hacker, but for someone who can maintain an up-to-date 
and critical view of new developments in the Lisp community. The 
design of WWW interfaces (Java) may also become part of the job. 
Appointment will be full-time or 8/10 for two years. Depending on 
experience the salary will be between Dfl. 4304,-- and Dfl. 5931,-- 
gross per month, on full-time basis.

EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST
Vacancy 21.3.00

For empirical work on categorical rhythm perception (identification 
and discrimination tasks) we are looking for someone with experience 
in designing and running experiments. Data analysis will be one of 
the tasks using (Macintosh) statistical packages. Experience in 
conducting automated experiments is requested. Affinity with music 
cognition work is an advantage. We offer a position in an exciting 
interdisciplinary team. Appointment will be full-time or 8/10 for two 
years. Depending on experience the salary will be between Dfl. 
4110,-- and Dfl. 6516,-- gross per month, on full-time basis.
