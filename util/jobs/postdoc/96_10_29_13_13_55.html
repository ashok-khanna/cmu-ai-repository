Our group consists (by now) of 7 researchers and 1 PhD student 
(Head: Prof.~U.~Furbach) who  
are engaged in basic research and application-oriented development 
in the areas of ``AUTOMATED REASONING'', ``NON-MONOTONIC REASONING'' 
and ``DEDUCTIVE DATABASES''.\\
 
We are looking for an outstanding scientific staff (Post-Doc) for our 
research project on {\em Disjunctive Logic Programming\/}
(headed by Dr.~J.~Dix and Prof.~U.~Furbach, please consult
our web-page http://www.uni-koblenz.de/ag-ki/DLP/). This project is 
funded by the DFG (German Research Council) and 
the research position will be available from 
January 1, 1997, for the rest of the year. 
An extension for another 2 years is very likely, but depends on the
evaluation of the project in March-April 1997.
Salaries are payed according to BAT IIa.\\


The main aim of the project is to develop a programming
system which realizes various semantics for (extended) disjunctive
logic programs with negation. 
The underlying idea to achieve this goal is to 
combine {\em classical theorem proving\/}-technology
with methods from {\em non-monotonic reasoning\/} in knowledge
representation.
In particular we want to  (1) extend  PROLOG-like languages
by disjunction and various sorts of negation,
(2) develop  efficient implementations 
that can be applied  in practice,
(3) investigate their use for nontrivial applications.
The basis of the
system to be developed is PROTEIN, a first-order PTTP-like theorem
prover based on model-elimination calculus that does not use
contrapositives of the given clauses.
\\

We prefer candidates having a PhD in Computer Science or a comparable
qualification. Previous experience in either {\em Automated Theorem Proving\/}
or {\em Nonmonotonic Reasoning\/} is  indispensable (knowledge in both
fields is even better). Although knowledge of German is not presupposed, basic
knowledge will be appreciated.
