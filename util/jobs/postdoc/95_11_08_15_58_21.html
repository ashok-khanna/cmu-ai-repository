COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT, CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY, PITTSBURGH, PA

POSITION: Post-doctoral fellow in Computer Science

CONTACT: Prof. Manuela M. Veloso
         Computer Science Department

DESCRIPTION: Two-year (possibly three-year) post-doctoral position
working on planning and learning by analogical/case-based reasoning
within the Planning Initiative funded by the U.S. Department of
Defense.  Our main focus will be to extend the derivational analogy
framework developed in Prodigy/Analogy within the context of a
mixed-initiative environment in which the human user and the machine
planners cooperate. In particular, within the fully automated
Prodigy/Analogy system, the rationale for planning decisions is
captured and replayed autonomously. The envisioned extension to this
approach would observe a user make planning decisions, capture the
user's rationale for the choices explored and selected, provide
automated support for any detailed planning necessary, accumulate the
annotated mixed-initiative planning episodes, and support the user
with recollection and guidance for reuse of past planning episodes and
their rationale. We will be responsible for using and demonstrating
the system in a realistic military application.

Several faculty members are involved in this project and we will also
be in close collaboration with other parties in the Planning
Initiative.  The post-doctoral fellow selected is expected to make
significant contributions to the specific project mentioned above, as
well as contribute to the intellectual life of the larger researcher
community in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon
University.

QUALIFICATIONS: Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
This is an Artificial Intelligence system-building position within the
context of a specific application, so a very strong systems
implementation background is required.  Experience in planning,
analogical/case-based reasoning, integrated machine-user approaches,
and basic knowledge of machine learning techniques will be preferred.

TO APPLY: Send a resume and names of three references to the physical
or email address above (email preferred). Please have recommendations
letters specifically address the system building strengths and
weaknesses of the applicant.
