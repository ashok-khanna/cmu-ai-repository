POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH IN FACE RECOGNITION AND NEURAL NETWORKS

Department of Computer Science
Queen Mary and Westfield College
University of London


Applications are invited for a post-doctoral Research Associate to
work on a 3 years project to develop a real-time face tracking and
representation scheme, to study performance characteristics of neural
network learning in feature recognition, and to test an integrated
identification system under different application conditions in order
to quantify learning efficiency and effectiveness. There will be close
collaboration with Datacube UK Ltd and Bond Security Systems Ltd.

You must have or be about to obtain a PhD with research experience
ideally in computer vision and neural networks or closely related area
and have experience of programming in C under X windows and of using
Unix systems. Experience in face recognition and real-time machine
vision will be advantageous.

The Computer Science Department at QMW has a well established research
record in spatio-temporal analysis on image sequences, parallel
computation of image motion and tracking, and object trajectory
prediction through funding from SERC, MRC and ESPRIT. The successful
candidate will be undertaking novel research in a well equipped
vision laboratory consisting of advanced real-time image capturing and
tracking systems (Datacube MaxVideo 250 and MD1/2GX, INMOS Transputers
and AMT DAP 500 parallel processors) hosted by numerous SUN HyperSPARC
and SPARC workstations.

Informal enquiries may be made to Dr Shaogang Gong on +44
