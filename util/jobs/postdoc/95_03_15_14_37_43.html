Subject: Admin: Replace lists with newsgroups?
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

A subscriber has suggested that the AI-related jobs mailing lists be 
replaced or augmented with a newsgroup or newsgroups. Since I do not
have the facilities for a bidirectional email/news gateway, nor do I have
the time to write one, this would probably mean replacement. 

Before there is any discussion of this proposal (and such discussion
will NOT take place on this list), I would like to hear the answers to
two questions. Please email your responses to me directly at mkant@cs.cmu.edu.

   1. Would a change from a mailing list to a newsgroup adversely
      affect any of the list subscribers? Are there any subscribers
      who do not have access to netnews, or who strongly prefer to
      receive the job announcements in email form? Are there any other
      good reasons to remain as a mailing list? 

   2. Are any of you willing to take responsibility for the RFD and CFV
      process? I do not have the time to do this myself, but would be
      available to review the RFD and CFV posts before they went out.

My interpretation of the proposal is that it would replace the mailing
lists with three (unmoderated) newsgroups:
   comp.ai.jobs
   comp.lang.lisp.jobs
   comp.lang.prolog.jobs
The charters for these newsgroups would be for job postings, graduate
fellowship announcements, and postdoctoral position announcements.
Some issues to be discussed in the RFD include: posting of resumes, and
minimal moderation (to remove irrelevant posts and ensure that subject
lines are properly formatted).

Also, if this proposal does go forward, I'd like to see a proposal for
creating the following (unrelated) newsgroups that I think would be
equally useful:
   comp.ai.announce.books         Announcements of new AI books & publications
   comp.ai.announce.conferences   Announcements of AI conferences
The latter is necessary because news.announce.conferences is
essentially defunct, and even when it wasn't, the newsgroup needed
splitting anyway.
