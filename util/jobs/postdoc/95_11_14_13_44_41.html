Subject: Postdoc: Tutoring system at U.. of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA)
CC: Kurt Vanlehn <vanlehn+@pitt.edu>
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

The Andes project at the Learning Research and Development Center,
University of Pittsburgh, seeks a computer science post-doctoral
Research Associate with a background in tutoring systems or user
modeling.  The Research Associate will coordinate the Andes
project as well as develop one module of the Andes tutoring system.

The goal of the Andes project is to develop and test a tutoring system
that teaches college physics.  The system will be used both as a
testbed for evaluating various instructional methods and as a means of
improving instruction in a 1200-student university physics class.  The
Research Associate will be part of an 11-person team composed of
physicists, computer scientists and cognitive scientists.  

The Research Associate will have two main responsibilities.  One is to
develop a help system that coaches the student on procedural and
strategic issues involved in physics problem solving.  This help
system is one of 6 main modules in the Andes tutoring system.  The second
responsibility of the Research Associate will be to coordinate the
software development and testing of the whole Andes team.  In the
later stages of the project, the Andes team will conduct formal field
experiments with students using various versions of Andes.  The
Research Associate will be responsible for coordinating the fieldwork
as well, and meshing it with the software development.

The Research Associate should have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence,
preferably with a specialization in intelligent tutoring systems or
user modeling.  Knowledge of Lisp and experience in team-based software
development are necessary.  The position is funded for 3 years,
starting January 1, 1996.  The compensation includes a competitive
salary and full benefits.  If interest, please immediately contact
Kurt VanLehn (the PI) via the following:
