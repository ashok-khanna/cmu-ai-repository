=======================================================================
*Requirements for this post

Outstanding research and teaching ability are both required.

Undergraduate courses for which teaching contributions would be
particularly welcome include: (1) a general introduction to applied AI
and expert systems, taught to first year students; (2) a course on
theories of learning (other than connectionist theories already covered)
taught to second year students; (3) a course on planning, which could be
available as a third year option; (4) Prolog programming.
(Note: at present Pop-11 is taught as first AI language in term 1.)

Candidates must be able to supervise practical projects undertaken by
undergraduates and MSc students.

Other possible teaching contributions may be required in future.

We have no preference regarding area of research expertise in AI:
applicants will be judged on merit, subject to the need to meet our
teaching obligations. Applicants with publications in internationally
recognised journals or conference proceedings, and who are likely to be
able to attract good research students and/or external research funding
will be favoured. It is unlikely that we shall appoint a candidate who
has not yet completed a PhD. Promising applicants may be invited to
present a seminar on their research. Excellent communication skills will
be required.
