          The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the
             Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                      invites applications for a
          PostDoctoral Associate, Position #95-0148C

A Postdoctoral Associate in computational linguistics is needed to
work with a team developing a natural language understanding system
targeted at unrestricted domains.  The research will be part of a
fundamental research project seeking to embed intelligence into the
information infrastructure; several prototypes have been developed
that have been tested and used by the U.S. White House.

The individual will develop a bidirectional parser-generator for
English as a component of a larger system.  The parser-generator will
be closely coupled to a semantic representation built on research in
lexicalist and constructivist semantics and directed towards bottom-up
acquisition of knowledge from text.  The system will be applied to
unrestricted English and must fail gracefully when its coverage is
exceeded.

Qualifications: PhD in computational linguistics or related
field.  Individual must demonstrate an exceptional ability to design
and implement complex systems in Common Lisp; Lisp Machine experience
is a plus. Excellent communications and computational skills are
important because this individual will be working with a team and
building on a substantial software base.

NOTE: At present we anticipate that funding for this position will
continue through 7/31/96, with potential follow-on funding.

Qualified applicants, please respond mentioning position # to:
  Mr. James McCarthy
  MIT Personnel Office
  Building E19-238
  400 Main Street
  Cambridge, MA  02139
