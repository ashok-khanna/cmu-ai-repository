information contained in textual data in support of pharmaceutical research.

uncontrolled, native-language) and by the domain-specific image recognition 
of chemical structures.  This person will be responsible for conducting 
research and developing innovative applications that retrieve, filter, and 
analyze information across multiple formats and sources, interpret disparate 
formats, and create the necessary logical relationships and structure to  
support meaningful and accurate interpretation and analysis of scientific 
content.  

The successful candidate must function effectively as a strong contributor 
in a multidisciplinary research team, while working with minimal direction. 
Skills required are  knowledge of and experience in text processing, linguistic
analysis and AI techniques.  Position requires Ph.D. or equivalent work 
experience . Highly desirable are: academic or work experience in biology or 
chemistry (through organic chemistry); practical experience in document 
management systems; C or C++ programming  UNIX skills, and web page authoring 
skills  Research and publications in information science are also highly 
desirable.
