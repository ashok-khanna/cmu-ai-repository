                    POSTDOC RESEARCH POSITION

                          available at the
                   Department of Computer Science
                        Utrecht University
                          The Netherlands

                          for the project

                   ALGORITHMIC AND COMBINATORIAL
                   APPROACHES TO LABEL PLACEMENT


In the project research will be performed to achieve qualitatively good
and efficient automated label placement for geographic information
systems and mapping. Both label placement of measured data and placement
of street names is included in the research.  The study will make use of
genetic algorithms in combination with constraint satisfaction algorithms.
In addition to the theoretical analysis an implementation has to be
developed and tested on data that can appear in geographic information
systems, in vehicle navigation systems, and on maps.
The postdoc will collaborate with a PhD student who will study the
label placement problem by focussing on algorithms from computational
geometry.


Requirements:

- PhD degree in computer science.
- Knowledge of genetic and/or constraint satisfaction algorithms and
their analysis.
- Some knowledge of geographic information systems is an advantage.


Information:

More information can be obtained from dr.ir. Dirk Thierens
tel:+31-30-2534031, e-mail: dirk.thierens@cs.ruu.nl and from
prof.dr. M.H. Overmars, tel:+31-30-2533736, e-mail: markov@cs.ruu.nl.


Duration:

The project is supported by NWO, the Netherlands Organization for
Scientific Research. The postdoc position is funded for two years, and
should start in 1997, preferably as soon as possible. The salary depends
on the experience of the candidate.
