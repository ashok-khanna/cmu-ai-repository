GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP - Statistical Language Processing

	Department of Computer Science and Computing Research Lab
	New Mexico State University
	Las Cruces, NM 88003

*************************************************************************

A research assistantship is available for a graduate student beginning
Fall 1995.  The project will involve developing probabilistic
classifiers for two challenging and diverse natural language
processing (NLP) tasks using a common set of techniques.  One
classifier will be capable of disambiguating a large vocabulary of
words with respect to full sets of sense distinctions from published
sources, e.g., Longman's on-line dictionary.  The second will perform
a discourse processing task that involves segmentation, reference
resolution, and belief: segmenting a text into blocks that express the
beliefs and opinions of a single agent, and identifying noun phrases
that refer to that agent.  A major focus of this project will be
statistical techniques for developing probabilistic models for such
high-level NLP tasks.

The Department of Computer Science and the Computing Research Lab (CRL)
conduct research and development work on all aspects of NLP and are
situated on the campus of New Mexico State University (NMSU).

   DESIRED BACKGROUND:
	* Familiarity with statistical AI techniques (e.g., Bayesian
	  networks, various machine learning techniques, corpus-based
	  NLP techniques)
	* Familiarity with computational linguistics 
	* Strong computer science background with software development
	  experience (particularly in C)
	* Demonstrated capability for independent work
	* Good written and verbal skills

   JOB DESCRIPTION
	Research assistantship for a graduate student at NMSU.
	Admission to a graduate program at NMSU is required (all
	application materials must be received by July 1st).  The
	successful applicant will work with a small research team
	on developing advanced probabilistic classifiers for NLP
	tasks.  The work will involve both directed reading and
	extensive software development.

If you are interested please contact me by e-mail as soon as possible.
