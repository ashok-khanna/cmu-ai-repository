                  Ph.D.  Tracks  in  Cognitive  Science

                      Center for Cognitive Science
                State University of New York at Buffalo

1      Description

Ph.D. study of Cognitive Science at the University at Buffalo consists
of a special Cognitive Science Track in the Ph.D. program of each of
the participating departments.  Participation in the track consists of
five steps:

   1.  Admission as a Graduate Student Member of the Center for
       Cognitive Science;

   2.  Taking the prescribed set of Cognitive Science courses;

   3.  Attendance at colloquia of the Center for Cognitive Science

   4.  Having an interdisciplinary, Cognitive Science dissertation com-
       mittee.

   5.  Writing a Cognitive Science-related dissertation.


2      Admission

To become a Graduate Student Member of the Center for Cognitive
Science, a student must be admitted into the graduate program of one
of the participating departments.  This will be the student's "home
department."  In addition,  the student must be admitted into the
Center for Cognitive Science.  For direct admission into the Center,
send  a  copy  of  the  application  materials  you  are  sending  to  your
prospective home department to:

       Graduate Student Admissions Committee
       Center for Cognitive Science
       652 Baldy Hall
       State University of New York at Buffalo
       Buffalo, NY 14260-1010

For admission as a Graduate Student Member of the Center for Cog-
nitive Science after admission to UB, send the following materials to
the above address:

   1.  A statement of purpose, including a tentative set of Cognitive
       Science courses to be taken, endorsed by the two faculty mem-
       bers of the Center for Cognitive Science.

   2.  A letter of recommendation from the student's major profes-
       sor, who must be a faculty member of the Center for Cognitive
       Science.

    All Graduate Student Members of the Center for Cognitive Science
are expected to be working on Cognitive Science Tracks in their home
departments.


3      Financial  Aid

Financial aid, in the form of Teaching Assistantships, Graduate As-
sistantships, Research Assistantships, and Fellowships are available
from the home department.  In addition, each year, the Center for
Cognitive Science has a limited number of Graduate Assistantships
and Fellowships. These are available only to students who have been
admitted or who have been offered admission as a Graduate Student
Member of the Center for Cognitive Science. To apply for a Cognitive
Science Assistantship or Fellowship if you are already a Graduate Stu-
dent Member, send a statement of purpose to the Center office and
have at least one faculty member of the Center send a supporting
letter of recommendation.


4      Participating  Departments

The currently participating departments are listed below. For changes
to this list, consult the Center office or the office of your home de-
partment.

   o Anthropology             o Communicative Disorders and Sciences
   o Computer Science         o Linguistics
   o Philosophy               o Psychology


5      Dissertation  Committee

The dissertation committee must satisfy the requirements of the home
department. In addition the committee chair (major professor) must
be a faculty member of the Center for Cognitive Science,  and one
other committee member must be a faculty member of the Center
for Cognitive Science not from the home department. Satisfying this
requirement  might  require  a  larger  dissertation  committee  than  is
usual for the home department.


6      The  Graduate  Student  Association  for Cognitive  Science

The Graduate Student Association for Cognitive Science provides an
opportunity for graduate students interested in Cognitive Science to
interact with each other. All Graduate Student Members of the Cen-
ter for Cognitive Science are automatically members of the Graduate
Student Association for Cognitive Science. Other interested graduate
students may join.


7      Students  in  Non-Participating  Departments

A graduate student whose home department is not one of the partici-
pating departments listed in Section 4 may still pursue a Ph.D. Track
in Cognitive Science. The student must satisfy all of the requirements
listed in this document with the following modifications:

Admission      
       The  student's  major  professor  need  not  be  a  faculty
       member of the Center of Cognitive Science.  However, in ad-
       dition to the materials listed in Section 2, the student must
       submit a letter from his/her department's Director of Graduate
       Studies approving the student's intention to pursue a Cognitive
       Science Ph.D. Track.

Dissertation Committee            
       The committee chair (major professor) need not be a faculty member
       of the Center of Cognitive Science, but two members of the
       dissertation committee must be, and they must be from different
       departments.

Course Requirements           
       The 5 Cognitive Science courses other than the required course must
       be from 3 different departments, and no more than 2 can be from the
       same department. One of these 3 departments may be the student's
       home department if that department has courses listed in Section 9
       or Section 10.


8      Course  Requirements

In addition to the requirements of the home department, each student
in a Cognitive Science Track must take 6 Cognitive Science courses
that carry at least 3 credit hours each.  One of these must be the
required course (see below). At least 3 of the remaining 5 courses must
be from outside the home department, and from at least 2 different
departments.  At least 4 of the 5 non-required courses must be from
the list of "central" courses given in Section 9. The final course may
be from the list of "elective" courses given in Section 10.  At least 4
of the 6 courses must cohere with each other, and with the student's
proposed dissertation research, as determined by the student and the
student's major professor.  A cross-listed course may be considered
to be in any of the departments that cross-list it, at the student's
discretion.


8.1     Required Course

The course required for the Ph.D. Tracks in Cognitive Science is:

    o  Introduction to Cognitive Science, crosslisted as CS 575 and LIN 575.


8.2     Topical Areas

At least 4 of the 6 Cognitive Science courses must form a coherent
group.  As an aid in forming such a group of courses, we list below
some Cognitive Science topical areas and some courses that fit within
them. These lists are not meant to be definitive nor constraining. It
is up to the student and the student's major professor to choose the
4 coherent courses according to the student's research interests.
