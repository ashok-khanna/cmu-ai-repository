                          UNIVERSITY OF DURHAM

               LABORATORY FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING

                     DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

Applications are invited for a research assistant to work  on  the  DEAR
project  which  is  building a natural language database interface using
the LOLITA natural-language processor and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

Candidates should have experience in the use of functional languages for
programming   substantial   software   systems   (preferably  with  lazy
functional languages). Experience in  natural  language  processing  and
databases would also be helpful.

The  post  is  available  immediately  for  a  period  of two years (but
applicants should be able to start by mid October at  the  latest).  The
salary  will  be  on  the  research  1A  scale  (14,317 to 17,466 pounds
sterling), depending on experience.

Applicants should contact Rick Morgan:

                         The DEAR Project

The DEAR (Database EAsy Retrieval) project aims to build a sophisticated
natural  language  interface  for  a  commercial  database. This will be
achieved by building on four pieces of technology :-

  - LOLITA (Large-scale, Object-based, Linguistic Interactor, Translator
    and  Analyser)  a  sophisticated natural-language processor which is
    the result of as eight year research  programme at the University of
    Durham. LOLITA has been designed as a general purpose NL base system
    upon  which  specific  applications  can be built.  It is written in
    Haskell and,  at over 40,000 lines,  is one of the  world's  largest
    lazy functional programs.

  - GHC,   the  Glasgow  Haskell  Compiler,  aims  to  provide   Haskell
    programmers  with a  state-of-the art  compiler and to  serve as the
    driving  force  behind,  and  test-bed  for,  research  in  language
    design  and  implementation  technology.  GHC is intended to compile
    code for parallel machines.

  - A large commercial database provided by the project's `heavy  uncle'
    Rolls Royce and Associates.

  - A commercial multiprocessor (Sun SparcCentre 2000)

The  system  will take NL queries, translate them into SQL, pass them on
to the (unmodified) underlying database and display the result.

The project aims  to  speed  the  analysis  by  executing  LOLITA  on  a
multiprocessor   using  a  parallel  implementation  of  the  functional
language Haskell. The significance of the project  goes  well  beyond  a
single  Rolls  Royce  database.  Firstly,  since  the  interface  to the
database is achieved through SQL,  the  system  should  be  usable  with
almost  any  database. Secondly the work will be applicable to knowledge
bases other than relational DBMSs.   Finally,  the  project  will  be  a
convincing  (and  demanding)  application of parallel Haskell which will
identify the important issues in large-scale programming in  the  purely
functional paradigm.
