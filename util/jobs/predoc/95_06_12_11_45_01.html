Course: M.Sc. Knowledge Engineering
=================================

This is an ADVANCED masters course intended for graduates who have either a 
computing degree or relevent experience, based at the University of 
Sunderland in the United Kingdom.

Objectives
=========

On completion of this course the student will be able to:

# understand the nature, role and function of knowledge based systems in 
organisations
# elicit and represent knowledge from a specified problem domain
# specify, design, implement and document knowledge based systems which are 
technically, professionally and economically acceptable
# exhibit sufficient critical awareness of current knowledge based 
technologies to be able to select
appropriate areas for KBS deployment
# select and critically assess relevant material from original papers and 
articles, in order to plan,
schedule, monitor and control the conduct of a substantial piece of research 
and development work
culminating in the production of a knowledge based system
# communicate, both orally and in writing, a programme of work in knowledge 
engineering
# act as a professional knowledge engineer with respect to codes of conduct 
and practice

Course Overview
===============

The M.Sc./PGD in Knowledge Engineering is an advanced course intended for 
graduates who have either a computing degree or relevant qualifications and 
are interested in developing a professional understanding of the 
construction of knowledge based systems. The course has a modular structure 
and operates within a Postgraduate Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme. 
The course consists of two main elements: a taught element (which has a 
value of 70 CATS credits at level M) and a project, undertaken for an 
industrial/commercial or a research client (which has a value of 50 CATS 
credits at level M).  Intermediate awards of Postgraduate Certificate and 
Postgraduate Diploma are available for students who wish to leave the course 
during or at the end of the taught part having gained 35 or 70 credits 
respectively. The Diploma is also available for award to those students who 
fail to deliver a satisfactory project.

The major computing topics offered within the taught element of the course 
are :-

STAGE 1
Expert Systems (5 credits)
Knowledge Representation (5 credits)
Knowledge Acquisition (5 credits)
Knowledge Based Systems Design Methodologies (10 credits)
Expert System Programming (10 credits)


STAGE 2
Research Methods (5 credits)
Adaptive Computation (10 credits)
Natural Language Processing (5 credits)
Architectures for Large Knowledge Based Systems (10 credits)
Contempory Applications of Knowledge Engineering (5 credits)

STAGES 1 and 2
Seminar Series

STAGE 3
Project (50 credits)

Delivery Modes
==============

The course is for 1 year full time or 3 years part time ( 2 evenings per 
week).
