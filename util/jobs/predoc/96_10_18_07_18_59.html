BRITISH TELECOM / UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM (UK) RESEARCH STUDENTSHIP

The School of Computer Science has available a BT-funded Research
studentship to work on the specification of "features" for complex
software systems. Features are small additions or modifications
introduced to enhance software products.  The appointed Research
Student will work at the School of Computer Science in Birmingham
under the supervision of Dr.  Mark Ryan, and will have the benefit of
interaction with the Signaling Protocols group at BT Research Labs,
Martlesham Heath.

The research will involve the following areas of computer science:
logic; temporal logic; defaults; model checking; theorem proving. Some
software tool development will also be included. Applicants should be
based in the EU and possess a good honours degree (equivalent to a first
or upper second class degree in a UK university) in Mathematics or
Computer Science, or a closely related subject. Because the research
is bound to a specific project, the studentship value is higher than
the EPSRC standard at approximately 6600 pounds per year, for three
years.

Further details and application forms from Dr. Mark Ryan, email
M.D.Ryan@cs.bham.ac.uk, http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mdr/bt.html.
School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham,
