                State University of New York at Buffalo

                      CENTER FOR COGNITIVE SCIENCE

                        The Center's Objectives

A principal function of the Center for Cognitive Science at the  Univer-
sity  at  Buffalo is to promote the development of research networks and
of new research activities in cognitive science, both locally and across
institutions.  To do this, the Center organizes colloquia, panel discus-
sions,  research-group  presentations,  student-research  presentations,
laboratory "open houses", workshops, and conferences that bring together
both members of the campus and invited visitors working on  cutting-edge
issues  in  cognitive  science.   The  Center  helps  to establish novel
cross-disciplinary linkups among faculty and students that may result in
research  projects  and  grant  proposals,  and  it already serves as an
umbrella for several ongoing active research groups.  It sponsors a Gra-
duate  Cognitive  Science  Club,  composed  of  students  from different
departments who meet regularly  to  discuss  current  cross-disciplinary
issues.  It publishes a Research Report series in cognitive science that
is widely distributed as well as exchanged for  comparable  series  from
other institutions.  It provides a central meeting place, that serves as
a nexus for cross-disciplinary communication.

In addition, the Center is increasingly engaged in the development of an
academic  curriculum  in cognitive science.  It has recently established
an undergraduate special major leading to a B.A. in  cognitive  science.
And  it  is planning further curricular development so that students can
pursue training and, eventually, higher degrees in this  relatively  new
field.

The Center is currently organizing the first international Summer Insti-
tute  in  Cognitive Science, to take place in July 1994.  This four-week
educational program is intended to  provide  a  full  grounding  in  the
entire  cognitive science discipline with both introductory and advanced
coursework and numerous presentations, panel discussions, and  workshops
involving prominent figures in the field.

                            Research Groups

A number of research groups investigating different areas  of  cognitive
science  are  either  wholly  affiliated  with or closely related to the
Center.

(1)  The Discourse and Narrative Research Group.

     In the Discourse and Narrative  Research  Group,  different  disci-
     plinary  perspectives  converge to ascertain the organizing proper-
     ties of various discourse genres, especially  narrative.   Composed
     of  some  ten  Center faculty members and a like number of students
     representing seven disciplines, the group applies  the  methods  of
     linguistics  to  analyze the determining effects of the lexicon and
     of grammar  on  the  organization  of  discourse;  the  methods  of
     psychology   to  track  the  cognitive  processing  involved  as  a
     discourse progresses; the methods of computer science to model  the
     properties of discourse structure as well as the representation and
     updating of the "story world" in an unfolding  narrative;  and  the
     methods  of  the  field of communicative disorders to ascertain the
     discourse  characteristics  of  autistic  or  other  communication-
     impaired  individuals  and what this reveals about the structure of
     standard discourse.

(2)  The Spoken Language Research Group.

     The Spoken Language Research  Group  includes  some  twelve  Center
     faculty  members  and a comparable number of students, representing
     mainly the fields of communicative disorders, linguistics,  neurol-
     ogy, and psychology, and it encompasses the operation of seven dif-
     ferent campus laboratories as well as one research  facility  in  a
     teaching  hospital.   The group coordinates and integrates research
     centered on the cognitive processes involved in the  physical  pro-
     duction  and  reception  of  spoken  language  in both children and
     adults and in both impaired and unimpaired functioning.  The  group
     has  recently been awarded a major training grant that will support
     graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the  development  of
     their skills in spoken language research.

(3)  The SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) Research Group (SNeRG).

     The SNePS Research Group consists of three faculty members  of  the
     Department of Computer Science and about 15 computer science gradu-
     ate students.  Its long-term goal is the design and construction of
     a  natural-language-using  computerized  cognitive  agent,  and the
     research in artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and
     cognitive  science  necessary  for  that  endeavor.  The three-part
     focus of the group is on knowledge representation,  reasoning,  and
     natural-language understanding and generation.  The group is widely
     known   for   its    development    of    the    SNePS    knowledge
     representation/reasoning  system, and Cassie, its computerized cog-
     nitive agent.

(4)  The Vision Group.

     The Vision Group includes three Center faculty  members  and  seven
     additional  faculty  members representing the fields of physiology,
     biophysics, computer science,  psychology,  anatomy,  biochemistry,
     ophthalmology and engineering.  The purpose of the group is to pro-
     mote interdisciplinary research in the field of vision through sem-
     inars  and a team-taught graduate course in vision.  Recent activi-
     ties of the group include the sponsoring of a  workshop  on  vision
     and the writing of the book _The Science of Vision_, just published
     by Springer-Verlag.

(5)  The Cognitive Neurosciences/Neurolinguistics Research Group.

     The   Cognitive   Neurosciences/Neurolinguistics   Research   Group
     includes  faculty from Neurology, Linguistics, Psychology, and Com-
     municative  Disorders.   Graduate  students  from  Linguistics  and
     Psychology  also  participate in the activities of this group.  The
     research of this group addresses a number of issues surrounding the
     neuro-psychological  and  neurophysiological  basis of language and
     cognition.  A major research interest is the longitudinal study  of
     the  linguistic,  cognitive, and neurological development of normal
     and brain damaged infants.  This research involves neuronal plasti-
     city,  language  development,  and the sensitivity of physiological
     methods in detecting developmental changes in  brain  organization.
     The  effects  of  early  hormone exposure on brain organization and
     subsequent cognitive and linguistic abilities are also  being  stu-
     died.   The group was founded initially by the collaboration of two
     programs: the Division of Developmental  and  Behavioral  Neurosci-
     ences in the Department of Neurology and the Department of Linguis-
     tics.

(6)  The Research Group on Conceptual Structure.

     A newly formed research group will be investigating the  common  or
     distinct  properties  of conceptual structure as this is manifested
     in different cognitive systems such as those of  language,  reason-
     ing, memory, perception, and cultural cognition.  The University at
     Buffalo is particularly rich in researchers involved with the  more
     conceptual  or qualitative end of the cognition spectrum, and it is
     anticipated  that  faculty  from  anthropology,  computer  science,
     linguistics, philosophy, and psychology will be working together in
     the new research group on conceptual structure.
