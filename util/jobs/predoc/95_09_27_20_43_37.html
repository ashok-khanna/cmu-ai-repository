O-Plan

O-Plan is a command, planning and control architecture with an open
modular structure intended to allow experimentation on or replacement of
various components.  The research is seeking to determine which
functions are generally required in a number of application areas and
across a number of different command, planning, scheduling and control
systems.

O-Plan aims to demonstrate how a planner, situated in a task assignment
and plan execution (command and control) environment, and using
extensive domain knowledge, can allow for flexible, distributed,
collaborative, and mixed-initiative planning.  The research is seeking
to verify this total system approach by studying a simplified
three-level model with separable task assignment, plan generation and
plan execution agents.

O-Plan has been applied to logistics tasks that require flexibility of
responses for changing situations.

University Postgraduate Entry as a Student

The objective of the PhD programme is to produce a research worker who
has acquired good all-round knowledge of Artificial intelligence, in
depth knowledge of a specialist area, and the research skills to carry
out and present a piece of original research for submissions for a
postgraduate degree.

The MPhil and PhD degrees require a minimum of two and three years
supervised study respectively, and are awarded on the basis of a thesis
and an oral examination.

A student who enters the higher degree programme will be registered as a
supervised postgraduate student.  In the first year, he or she will be
expected to attend lectures relevant to his/her research topic.  These
lectures will be selected from the modules offered to MSc candidates.
Students are also encouraged to attend the meetings of Special Interest
Groups relevant to their area of interest.  Most research groups in the
Department have such meetings on a regular basis.

Although course work is not examined formally, each student is required
to give two presentations during the first year.  In order to register
as an MPhil/PhD candidate at the beginning of the second year of study,
a student must submit a thesis proposal not later than 9 months after
the date of entry.

An applicant should have a first or upper second class honours degree
(or equivalent of) in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science,
Education, Electrical Engineering, Psychology, Mathematics, Philosophy
or related subject.

Preference will be given to applicants with a Masters Degree in
Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Based Systems, or equivalent.

If you would like to be considered for admission as a postgraduate
student, please obtain an application form, and return along with a copy
