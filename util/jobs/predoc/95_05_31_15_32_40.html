 			THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST FLORIDA
           Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of
                  Human & Machine Cognition

           Florida AI Graduate (MS) Student Fellowship

The Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Human &
Machine Cognition (IHMC) at the University of West Florida
invites your application for the Fall of 1995. This is a
special research fellowship restricted to Florida residents.

The IHMC was founded with legislative support in 1990 as an
interdisciplinary research unit. Additionally, IHMC has
succeeded in securing substantial extramural support and has
established an enviable research and publication record.
Interdisciplinary research is underway in the computational
and philosophical foundations of AI, computers in education,
knowledge-based systems, neural networks, internet-based
autonomous agents, cognitive psychology, and reasoning under
uncertainty.

The University is situated in a 1000-acre protected nature
preserve bordering the Escambia River, and is approximately
14 miles north of the country's finest white-sand beaches.
New Orleans is only 3 hours away by car.

The successful applicant(s) will have a BS in Computer
Science with outstanding academic performance, a GRE score of
at least 1400, and a strong interest in one or more of the
following areas: AI, cognitive science, human/machine
interaction, or any of several other areas. The Florida AI
Graduate Student Fellowship includes a tuition-waiver and a
half-time graduate research assistantship at the IHMC while
pursuing a MS in Computer Science.

Applicants should email <kford@ai.uwf.edu> their vita and a
letter of application to:

        Dr. Kenneth Ford, Director
        Institute for Human and Machine Cognition
        University of West Florida
        Pensacola, FL 32514.
