Research Studentship in Artificial Intelligence


Applications are invited to join a small but highly active team 
working in the area of AI based in Milton Keynes. The project is 
concerned with the development of a structural model-based 
environment for the simulation and fault diagnosis of physical 
systems. The post will commence in October 1995, or before, if 
convenient.

The objective of the project is to utilise the structural 
information of a physical system to transform models step-by-step 
from high-level abstraction to low-level detail. This information 
will be used to reason how and why a system works (or perhaps does 
not work) in a pre-specified way using mixed qualitative and 
numerical simulation. The research will develop a structural 
model-based fault-diagnostic system which will be integrated into 
a traditional rule-based system. This will involve the creation of 
a set of well-defined components and processes in a knowledge base. 
These declared components and processes will then be used to develop 
automatic modelling of a system. Finally, the formulation of a mixed 
qualitative and numerical simulation method is required to perform 
fault candidate hypothesis, refinement and location.

Students with a good honours degree in Computer Science or 
Mathematics (or equivalent) with a particular interest in AI 
theory and application are encouraged to apply. 

The appointment will be initially for one year, renewable for 
further two years subject to satisfactory progress. The successful 
application will be expected to register for a PhD. The studentship 
will have a stipend of 5000 pounds sterling per annum after the 
payment of the Home Student tuition fees. For overseas students this 
stipend will be reduced to cover the overseas tuition fee difference.

The Artificial Intelligence Group

The Department of Computer and Information Sciences has recently 
set up an AI group to work on AI theory and application in 
recognition of the staff's expertise in this area. It is a small 
but highly active team. Research interests of the group include 
automated modelling, model-based simulation and reasoning, 
fault-diagnosis, automated control, case-based reasoning, 
agent-based reasoning and intelligent CAD/CAE. Application areas 
to which these techniques have been applied include engineering, 
industrial and financial systems.
