	Research Fellowships / Research Assistantships

The School of Computing and Information Technology (CIT) at Griffith
University wishes to fill several new research positions.  These positions
are funded by six new ARC Large Grants, University funding for ARC Small
Grants, and University support for the CRC for Distributed Systems
Technology.

CIT's large complement of internationally recognised researchers,
involvement in major strategic research and development projects with 
high levels of external funding, and exceptional computing facilities
(including the Queensland Parallel Supercomputing Facility) offer an
outstanding research environment.  Griffith University is recognised
nationally for its innovation and commitment to multidisciplinary research
and teaching.

1.  Distributed systems technology: Distributed parameterised computation
    and data management in multidatabase systems.
    Research fellow for three years.
    Applicants are expected to have research experience in distributed
    computing and/or database systems, and in experimental computing.
    Contact Associate Professor David Abramson (davida@cit.gu.edu.au, 
    +61 3875 5049) or Professor Rodney Topor (rwt@cit.gu.edu.au, 
    +61 3875 5042) for more details.

2.  Re-engineering software for improved reliability and maintainability.
    Research assistant for one year with possibility of renewal.
    Applicants are expected to have experience in Prolog and formal methods.
    Contact Professor Geoff Dromey (G.Dromey@cit.gu.edu.au. +61 7 3875 5040)
    for more details.

3.  Scaling up formal software development for industry-scale applications.
    Part-time research assistant for one year with possibility of renewal.
    Applicants are expected to have experience in compiler technology
    and formal methods.
    Contact Professor Geoff Dromey (G.Dromey@cit.gu.edu.au. +61 7 3875 5040)
    for more details.

4.  A parallel hypothetical reasoning system for constraint satisfaction.
    Research assistant/fellow for one year with possibility of renewal.
