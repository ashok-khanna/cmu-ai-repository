            E.B. Spratt Bursaries in Computer Science

The Computing Laboratory at the University of Kent has available a
number of bursaries for PhD students.  Applicants must hold a good
first degree in Computer Science or a closely related subject.  The
bursaries cover tuition fees (at the EC rate) and provide living
expenses at the current research council rates.  Bursaries
are tenable for one year in the first instance but, subject to satisfactory
research performance, will be extended for a further two years.

In particular applications in the following areas are encouraged:

Theoretical Computer Science

        Computing with Exact Real Numbers
        Program Development in Constructive Type Theories
        Formal Modelling of Distributed Systems
        Functional Programming and Scientific Visualization
        Abstract Interpretation for Concurrent Constraint Programs

Text Processing and Electronic Publishing and Ethics

        Multilingual legal database work
        Distributed electronic journals
        Transformation and reuse of structured documents
        Aids for human memory
        Computer Ethics
        Hyper-Programming

Database Technology and Object Management

        Object-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Systems
        Temporal Databases
        Decision Support System for Environmental Modelling
        Multimedia Databases

Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems

        Expert Systems
        Monte Carlo Markov Chain Algorithms

Numerical Computing, Scientific Visualization and Simulation

        Parallel Linear Equation Solvers using High Performance Fortran
        Software quality metrics
        Functional Programming and Scientific Visualization
        Hand-held navigators
        Visualization and description of spatial ecological models

                       General Information
                       ===================

The Computing Laboratory has an international reputation for computing
research.  There are approximately forty people on the research staff,
with a similar number providing support and computing services.

Students are normally expected to present their work-in-progress to a
wider audience a number of times during their studies, and are
encouraged to attend appropriate conferences and seminars.
Postgraduate travel funds are available.
Recipients of the awards are required to perform no more than 60
hours teaching per term (averaged over the year) for which there is
no further remuneration.

Research students have full access to the computing facilities of the
laboratory.  In addition, each postgraduate is equipped with a personal
computer or X-terminal allowing direct access to central computing.

The laboratory's main areas of research are:

+ Networks and Distributed Systems
+ Parallel Processing
+ Software Tools and Electronic Publishing
+ Functional Programming and Theoretical Computer Science
+ Database Technology and Object Management
+ Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems
+ Numerical Computation, Simulation and Visualization
