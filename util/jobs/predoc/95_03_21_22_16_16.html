            OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE RESEARCH IN AI 
            -----------------------------------------

The Computer Science Department and the new Volen Center for Complex
Systems at Brandeis University are announcing a newly funded research
program in autonomous agents, focusing on multi--agent and
multi--robot systems and machine learning, headed by Maja Mataric (PhD
MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, 1994).  For details on research
directions and a photo of the available robot herd see:

For graduate admission information see:

To get more information about the Volen Center for Complex Systems,
about the Computer Science Department, and about other faculty, see:

cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience programs at Brandeis see:

The following are brief summaries about research directions, the Volen
Center for Complex Systems, and Brandeis University:

About research directions:
--------------------------
Maja Mataric's interdisciplinary research focuses on understanding
systems that integrate perception, representation, learning, and
action.  Her current work is applied to synthesis and analysis of
behavior in situated agents and multi--agent systems, and on learning
and imitation, in software, dynamical simulations, and physical
robots.  Learning new behaviors and behavior selection, as well as
memory and representation are the main thrusts of the research.  The
newest project models learning by imitation, through the interaction
of a collection of cognitive systems, including perception (attention
and analysis), memory (declarative and non-declarative
representations), action sequence planning, motor control,
proprioception, and learning.  Prof. Mataric encourages students with
interests and/or backgrounds in AI, autonomous agents, machine
learning, cognitive science, and cognitive neuroscience to apply.  

About the Volen Center for Complex Systems:
-------------------------------------------
In May 1994 Brandeis University announced the opening of the new Volen
National Center for Complex Systems with the goal of promoting
interdisciplinary research and collaboration between faculty from
Biology, Computer Science, Linguistics, Mathematics, Neuroscience,
Physics, and Psychology.  The Center, whose main mission is to study
the brain, intelligence, and advanced computation, has already earned
accolades from scientists world wide, and continues to expand.

The Computer Science Department is located in the Volen Center and is
the home of four Artificial Intelligence faculty actively involved in
the Center activities and collaborations: Rick Alterman, Maja Mataric,
Jordan Pollack, and James Pustejovsky.

About Brandeis:
---------------
Brandeis is located in Waltham, a suburb 10 miles west of Boston, with
easy rail access to both Cambridge and downtown. Founded in 1948, it
is recognized as one of the finest private liberal arts and science
universities in the United States. Brandeis combines the breadth and
range of academic programs usually found at much larger universities,
with the friendliness of a smaller and more focused research
community.
