        Space Grant Fellowships for New Graduate Students
                     Oregon State University
                   Computer Science Department

Are you interested in computer science and how it relates to space
technology?  If so, and if you are a U.S. citizen considering graduate
study in computer science, then you are eligible to apply for an
Oregon Space Grant Fellowship.  These competitive fellowships are
awarded to incoming U.S. graduate students to our department.
Selections are made based on your past academic performance, a good
match of your interests with one of our faculty, and your GRE scores.

If you are selected for one of these one-year fellowships, you will
receive $16,400 in support plus a tuition waiver.  These fellowships
are part of a national program intended to increase the number of U.S.
scientists and engineers available for careers in aerospace and
related fields.  You will be expected to participate in Computer
Science research in one of the areas identified below during your
first year, and you must be a U.S. citizen.  Our research areas
relevant to the Space Grant Program include:
        algorithm analysis
        artificial intelligence
	computer applications in chemistry, physics, and mathematics        
	design of user interfaces for technical programmers
        parallel computing
        programming languages and systems
        real-time systems
        software engineering
        software tools for parallel scientific programming
        visual programming languages

About Oregon State University's Computer Science Department
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Computer Science is an active, pioneering group.
The faculty includes 15 Ph.D.s who conduct research and graduate
instruction.  3 of our faculty have been named NSF/Presidential Young
Investigators by the National Science Foundation.  Approximately 75
graduate students and 325 undergraduate students are enrolled.  We
have excellent laboratory and equipment facilities, and have been the
recipient of a number of research, equipment, and software grants from
our industrial friends and sponsors and from the National Science
Foundation and NASA.

Our section of Oregon ranks eighth in the country in computer-related
industry.  We have strong ties with several companies in the area,
including Tektronix, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sequent, and Intel.
Corvallis, home of Oregon State University, is located in the
Willamette Valley between the Cascade Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.
The city of 42,000 is about 85 miles south of the metropolitan area of
Portland, 50 miles from the scenic Oregon coast, and 80 miles west of
the beautiful Cascade Mountains.  Outdoor activities such as fishing,
camping, skiing, and hiking are within easy driving distance.  The
valley experiences wet, cool winters and warm, dry summers.

To apply
--------
The application process for a Space Grant Fellowship in Computer
Science at Oregon State University is quite simple: apply to our
graduate school in the usual way, but with 2 changes -- (1) all your
application materials, including official copies of GRE scores,
letters, etc., must be received as early as possible (and no later
than February 1), and (2) let us know of your interest by including in
your packet the fact that you are applying for the space grant and the
area(s) of interest to you.

For more information about our department, or to get the forms needed
to apply, see our WWW page:

Deadline for applying for grad school under a Space Grant Fellowship:
February 1, but earlier applications are encouraged.
