                        The University of Sheffield

                       Department of Computer Science

                     UP TO TWO RESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS IN
                       NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING

Research studentships are still available in the Natural Language Processing
research group for October 1995.  A candidate should have a good first
degree in Computer Science or something closely related, and have an interest
or experience in natural language processing. We would be particularly
interested, for one studentship, in someone with a background in some
mainstream paradigm in formal syntax and parsing. The other could
be in any area of our interests: information extraction, pragmatics, knowledge r
epresentation, interfaces to dialogue systems, computational lexicons etc.

Informal enquiries to Yorick Wilks (y.wilks@dcs.shef.ac.uk) or to Mark Hepple
(m.hepple@dcs.shef.ac.uk) for the first.  The Department's WWW address is:
http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/ where there is a lot of material on what we do, and
the group's involvement with ILASH (Institute for Language, Speech and Hearing).
The studentships would be at the standard UK rate (about 5000 pounds at present)
but some enhancement is possible for a good candidate. For those without
WWW access, a paper or email version of our research description is available
from Yorick Wilks at the above email address.
