Subject: Job: CLOS expertise.  FT position.  Excellent Opportunity!!!
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

Paul, 

	I am a software developer, responsible for two commercial
products. One is in Franz Allegro CL and uses a fair amount of CLOS.
The other is in a mixture of Visual C++ and FoxPro. I am familiar with
OOP and databases, and I am looking for some challenging projects.
Please call me if you are interested.
