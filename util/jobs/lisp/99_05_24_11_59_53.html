Brightware Corporation is a well-known leader in the industry of
knowledge-based software solutions. Brightware currently has several
opportunities to join a group of talented and experienced consultants  in
Brightware's Solutions division; we make up about one third of the company's
150 people and our consulting projects involve building custom
knowledge-based software applications.  

The following information is provided to describe our technology, various
aspects of the consulting position, and qualifications for the position.

Qualifications: The ideal applicant has many of the following
qualifications:

Education:        Advanced degree in computer science 
Experience:      Building production-quality knowledge-based software
applications, 
                	       working on team projects, knowledge
acquisition, professional consulting

Languages:      Art*Enterprise,ART-IM,CLIPS,KEE,LISP/CLOS,Java,C/C++,Emacs
Methods:          Rule-based expert systems, OO design
                	    	  case-based reasoning, AI methods,
knowledge representation
Systems:          flavors of UNIX, Windows NT

Other skills:      Web programming,TCP/IP, CORBA;
		  		N-tiered Client/server architecture design;
		   	    	Solid writing and verbal communication
skills;
		      		GUI development; RDBMS and SQL
(Sybase,Oracle)


*	All projects involve building intelligent applications in
Brightware's ART*Enterprise (A*E) development tool.  A*E core technology is
a high-performance rule engine and a full-featured object system; rules and
objects are defined in ArtScript, a dynamic interpreted language similar in
syntax to LISP. The following capabilities are supported natively in the
language through additional A*E components:
*	Case-based reasoning
*	Database integration
*	Web integration
*	TCP/IP Sockets-based inter-process communication
*	CORBA integration 
	Other interfaces may be built in C/C++ and linked into an A*E
application.

*	A*E is well-suited for representation of corporate knowledge and
policy, and for automation of data- and logic-intensive processes.  A*E has
been used to deploy hundreds of interesting and innovative applications that
improve efficiency and yield high return on investment for our customers.
Our client concentrations are in the financial services and
telecommunications sectors. 

*	Company Benefits:	All positions are salaried, full-time with
benefits, which include 2 weeks vacation, 11 paid holidays, 401K, sick leave
and company-paid health insurance.  As a full-time salaried employee, you
are paid when you are between assignments. Salary increases are determined
as part of annual reviews. Brightware is committed to advancing the skills
of its consultants by allowing for up to one week each year to attend a
manager-approved training class or technical conference.

*	Engagements will typically start off with a small, fairly
well-defined project, with 2 or 3 consultants, that last for a few months;
often a pilot project will lead into extensions and other projects. The
majority of clients will permit at least some project work to be done
offsite (e.g., at your home); a few clients allow remote access or for work
to be done offsite, and a few will not permit offsite work. 

*	Our projects are geographically scattered, and some amount of travel
is often required. Current openings are for projects in Atlanta and
Jacksonville.
