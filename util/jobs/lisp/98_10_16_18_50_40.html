Responsibiliies:             
            This individual will be performing design, programming, and
            testing in conjunction with advanced R&D efforts, software-product
            development, and individual application projects.  The principal
            focus of this position involves developing software that
            integrates multiple applications, involving application
            interfaces, application-interaction protocols, and client/server

            skills are required.  The candidate will be expected to have:

             -- the ability to write efficient, understandable, and
                well-documented code
             -- the ability to work within a large application--both as
                a member of a team and independently, with minimal 
                supervision
             -- substantial experience programming in ANSI Common Lisp
             -- familiarity with Common Lisp environments and tools (Franz
                Allegro CL or MCL)
 
            This position requires a working knowledge of Emacs and Unix.
            Experience with GBB, Java, C++, CORBA, object-based languages,
            networking prototols, threads, and integration of distributed
            applications is a plus.
