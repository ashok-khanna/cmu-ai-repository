Junglee is looking for full-time employees and summer interns 
to work on information discovery and data mining from text documents. 
We're looking for creative hard-working people with experience in some
of 
the following: databases, information extraction, parsing, regular
expressions, 
language design, statistics, machine learning, and GUI design.

Junglee develops Internet and Intranet information technology for the
future
and pushes it to market today. Technology that raises eyebrows and drops
barriers.  Founded in 1996 by four PhD students from the Stanford
University
Computer Science Department and a Silicon Valley veteran, Junglee
Corporation has excellent funding, high-profile customers, and a strong
revenue plan.

Our Virtual DataBase (VDB) engine is fueled by our ability for data
source
description, extraction, and attribute mapping.  Imagine capturing data
from
hunders of disparate unstructured web sites, mixing that with data from
other 
heterogeneous, distributed database and non-database sources and turning
it all
into a relational aggregate with the power of full SQL queries and the
ease and 
portability of HTML user interfaces.  We call these applications PALs -
powerful
information sites where people can ask for and get an answer. Several of
our PALs
are up on the web today at www.junglee.com and www.washingtonpost.com;
we are
currently building more of them for some well-known companies.

One of the key aspects of the technology is discovering/mining
information
from text. The project is lead by Peter Norvig who has done extensive
work
on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and other Artificial
Intelligence problems. While this project involves significant
ground-breaking
research, it is definitely a development project, not just research.
