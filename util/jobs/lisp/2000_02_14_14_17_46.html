The SRI International AI Center is looking for a highly creative 
computer scientist to join a team of researchers investigating new 
methods for intelligent control of systems in uncertain and highly 
dynamic environments. We are seeking an individual with interests and 
experience in one or more of the following areas: reactive systems, 
planning and scheduling, distributed AI, and agent systems.  A Ph.D. 
in computer science or a related field is required.

Responsibilities will involve working with current staff on a range 
of basic and applied research projects, with the expectation that the 
hired individual will initiate their own programs in the longer term. 
Research projects will develop new approaches for agent-based systems 
and intelligent process planning, management and control for dynamic 
environments. Our research projects typically involve a fair amount 
of programming (primarily in Lisp and JAVA) in order to explore, 
demonstrate and validate results and a strong development background 
is important.  The person selected for this position will have strong 
technical skills, broad knowledge, creativity, and work well in teams.

SRI is a multi-disciplinary research organization operating at the 
forefront of information technology, biology, engineering, and policy 
for more than 50 years. Located in the middle of Silicon Valley, SRI 
is well known for its innovative approach to clients' problems.  If 
you believe you are the person we are looking for and wish to join a 
high-power team, please send a current resume to the address below.
