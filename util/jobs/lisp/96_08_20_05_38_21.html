-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

If you work in the Phoenix area and have expertise in Scheme programming, I
need to know who you are.

I would like to do a small business application in Scheme + db + curses,
but I need to prove that my client will have redundant sources of Scheme
expertise for a future of continuous improvement (or a future after I have
been hit by a bus).  Otherwise I do it in C++, NOT!

Please reply to "Phoenix Schemer <birkholz@primenet.com>" for details.  I
am willing to share the work -- *boy* am I willing.
