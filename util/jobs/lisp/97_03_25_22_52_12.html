Subject: Job: Lisp/CLOS programmer wanted for Computer Animation
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU


Nichimen Graphics provides leading-edge tools for the video game industry.

We are expanding our development staff and looking for a strong Lisp/CLOS
programmer.  Experience with Unix, Windows NT and Allegro CL are strong
pluses.  Knowledge of 3D graphics is useful but not required.

The programmer will work on N-World, our integrated Lisp-based 3D
modeling and animation package and recent winner of a Computer Graphics
World Innovation Award from CGW Magazine.

Our offices are located near the beach in Playa del Rey, only minutes from
downtown Los Angeles.

Nichimen Graphics provides competitive benfits and a dynamic atmosphere in
a very exciting field.
