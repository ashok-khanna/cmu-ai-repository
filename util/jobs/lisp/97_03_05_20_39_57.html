                         RESEARCH PROGRAMMER POSITION

             The Pittsburgh Area Cognitive Tutoring (PACT) Center
                          Carnegie Mellon University

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The PACT Center is developing cognitive computer tutors for high school
mathematics.  Each of these tutors

     ~ focuses on the use of mathematical knowledge in reasoning about
       real world problem situations
     ~ emphasizes the use of modern computational tools
     ~ is constructed around a cognitive model of the knowledge students
       are aquiring

The PACT Algebra I Tutor is successfully deployed in 30 middle schools,
high schools and colleges in the Pittsburgh region, around the country
and Europe in 1996-1997, with wider dissemination planned in upcoming
years.  We are actively extending the cognitive tutor technology to
subsequent mathematics courses.

POSITION

A full-time programmer is currently needed to assist in the development
and evaluation of a cognitive computer tutor for algebra II. 
Responsibilities will include

     ~ programming a production system cognitive model of problem 
       solving and mathematics knowledge,
     ~ problem-solving interface development,
     ~ data analysis,
     ~ programming curriculum development tools, and
     ~ assistance in deploying and maintaining the computer tutors. 

BS or equivalent in cognitive science, cognitive psychology or computer
science and AI programming experience in Lisp is required.  Cognitive
modeling experience, production system programming, prior job experience
in cognitive science research, research programming or mathematics
education is desireable. 

The initial appointment is for one-year, but additional years are
anticipated.  We would like to hire immediately, although we can wait as
long as June for a particularly strong candidate.

Please send resumes to Albert Corbett (email: corbett +@cmu.edu, FAX:
268-1266, or Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon
University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213).  For more information on the project
