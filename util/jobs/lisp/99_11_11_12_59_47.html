                Current Faculty Position Openings

              Faculty Positions in Computer Science

We seek outstanding applicants for several tenure-track faculty positions at
all  levels.  Preference  will  be  given  to  candidates  in  parallel  and
distributed computing,  networks, bioinformatics, database and knowledgebase
systems,   software  engineering,   intelligent  software   agents,  machine
learning,  and  programming  languages. The  position  requires  a Ph.D.  in
Computer Science  or a  related field, and  strong evidence of  research and
teaching potential.

The  department currently  has thirteen  full time tenure-track  faculty and
offers BS,  MS, and Ph.D. degrees in  Computer Science. It also participates
in interdepartmental  graduate programs in  Bioinformatics and Computational
Biology and  Neuroscience. It has strong  research and education programs in
algorithms,   artificial  intelligence,  bioinformatics   and  computational
biology,  complexity  theory   and  complex  systems,  databases,  networks,
parallel  and   distributed  computing,   programming  languages,  robotics,
software engineering, and theory  of computing. A strong graduate program, a
well-funded  research  program, opportunities  provided  by the  Center  for
Bioinformatics  and Biological  Statistics ,  DoE Ames  Laboratory,  Virtual
Reality Applications  Center, and moderate  teaching load (three courses per
year)  provide  an excellent  work  environment that  nurtures leading  edge
research and innovative education.

Iowa  State University  is a  major land-grant  university located  in Ames,
Iowa.  Ames is a pleasant  small yet cosmopolitan city  with a population of
