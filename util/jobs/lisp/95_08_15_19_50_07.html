HELP MAKE HIGH-LEVEL COMPUTING WORK!

The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center has an opening as part of a project
exploring new techniques to make it possible for programmers to write
very high-level, modular code without sacrificing performance.  We are
making it possible to write extremely efficient code in languages even
higher-level than Lisp.

The project methodology involves working with other PARC researchers to
build a number of systems based on our techniques; we'll enhance our
techniques and tools as we go.

We have an opening for an experienced Lisp hacker, who can rapidly
implement and re-implement complex software to test and improve ideas
about how software should be written.  If you are the kind of hacker
that wants your code to end up looking great, this is the project for
you.

Experience with one or more of the following areas is also a plus:
language techniques such as partial evaluation, program synthesis and
run-time code generation; modern OS architectures; modern hardware
architectures; object-oriented programming, high-level programming
languages (e.g. LISP, SML, etc) and computational reflection.

Applicants should send a resume with the names of two references to:
