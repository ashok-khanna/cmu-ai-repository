Wanted: We're looking for professionals who can apply techniques in data
        analysis, machine learning and decision-theoretic reasoning to
        real-world industrial applications.  A Masters or PhD in computer
        science or equivalent experience is preferred.  An ability to interact
        with clients to determine their needs would be very helpful.
        Top-notch programming ability is a definite plus.

==============================================================================

"Some of the world's greatest software developers work at Harlequin."

We are world leaders in symbolic processing, electronic publishing and
related software applications.  We write in C, C++, Dylan, Lisp, ML,
Postscript, Prolog, and whatever else it takes.  Including English.

Harlequin's Electronic Publishing Division specialises in
Postscript-compatible technology, producing versions of its own software
for previewing images and text on screen or printing them either directly
to hard copy or indirectly through a pre-press system.

The Symbolic Processing Division develops software that helps to raise the
level at which computers appear to operate by enabling computers to
represent, change, manipulate, and communicate ideas, relationships, plans,
and implications.  From this environment come Harlequin's powerful software
development tools, such as LispWorks, Knowledgeworks and CLIM, together
with our unique application delivery tool, Transducer, as well as
Harlequin's own vertical market applications.

"We promise not to train you, but be ready to learn fast.  And never be
afraid to ask how, or why, or why not."

What do you get if you take a bunch of compiler writers and application
programmers, add some special hardware developers, and mix together with
color imaging technologists, technical authors, customer support officers,
product managers (and product marketing managers), QA administrators, sales
and marketing, and a liberal smattering of other talented people?  You get
a global computing company that works together (in harmony mostly, but not
always) to produce the world's finest software.

Harlequin started life in Cambridge, UK in 1986.  Today we have two offices
in Cambridgeshire, one in Manchester, an office in Sydney, Australia, and
three U.S. facilities in Cambridge, MA, Menlo Park, CA, and Seattle, WA.
Further operations are planned as we grow to some 250 staff world wide.
