                         RESEARCH PROGRAMMER POSITION

             The Pittsburgh Area Cognitive Tutoring (PACT) Center
                          Carnegie Mellon University

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The PACT Center is developing cognitive computer tutors for high school
mathematics.  Each of these tutors

   ~ focuses on the use of mathematical knowledge in reasoning about
     real world problem situations
   ~ emphasizes the use of modern computational tools
   ~ is constructed around a cognitive model of the knowledge students
     are aquiring

The PACT Algebra I Tutor is successfully deployed in 45 middle schools,
high schools and colleges in the Pittsburgh region, around the country
and in Europe in 1997-1998, with wider dissemination planned in upcoming
years.  Geometry and Algebra II Tutors are being piloted in Allegheny
county with wider dissemination also expected in future years.

POSITION

A programmer is needed, at either the junior or senior level, to provide
general support for the mathematics tutor development project.

JUNIOR LEVEL.  Primary responsibilities for a programmer hired at the
junior level will include:

   * Porting the tutor interface tools from LISP to JAVA 
     for purposes of cross-platform and web-based deployment.
   * Development of new tutor interface tools

This position requires a BS or equivalent in computer science, cognitive
science or cognitive psychology.  Experience with the following is
desireable: JAVA, LISP/CLOS, C++, any GUI framework, interprocess
communications

SENIOR LEVEL.  Primary responsibilities for a programmer hired at the
junior level will include:

   * Interface development tasks described above
   * Maintenance of our authoring environment called
     the Tutor Development Kit
   * Development of the Tutor Development Kit
     into a more powerful and user-friendly system

The Tutor Development Kit incorporates (1) a production language derived
from the ACT-R cognitive theory that is used to model skilled knowledge
and interpret student behavior, (2) a mathematical model of learning and
performance used to model student learning and (3) curriculum sequencing
facilities.

In addition to the requirements for the junior position, this position
requires experience in AI programming in LISP/CLOS.  An MS in computer
science, cognitive science or cognitive psychology is desireable, as is
experience in production system programming, cognitive modeling,
cognitive science research, research programming. 

The position is available immediately.  The initial appointment is for
one-year, but additional years are anticipated.

A full-time position is available, but a part-time position may be possible.

Please send resumes to Albert Corbett (email: corbett +@cmu.edu, FAX:
268-1266, or Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon
University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213).  For more information on the project
