Subject: Job: CLOS programming, temporary in Belmont, MA
Sender: ai+@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu


Synquiry Technologies is a small software development and research
firm located in Belmont, MA.  Part of our research work is supported
by contracts with the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency
(DARPA).  At present, as part of the DARPA Evolutionary Design of
Complex Software program, we are investigating the capture of design
rationale during software development, for use later on during system
evolution.  Parts of this project are being implemented in Java, while
others are being implemented in Common Lisp (CLOS).

Synquiry is seeking programmers with a background in CLOS to complete
a small project having to do with the modeling of design rationale.
The project involves implementing an algorithm for tracing data flow
through a graph representation of a program.  The basic algorithm has
been prototyped and tested; this project will be a clean
implementation and, if time permits, extensions.  We anticipate that a
programmer who is already familiar with CLOS should be able to
complete the project in 5-7 weeks.

Hours are flexible.  Experience in CLOS is a must.  Experience with
automatic theorem provers, or an interest in learning about them, is
desirable.  

This is a temporary position, but there is a possibility to extend it
into a longer-term position.  We cannot pay relocation costs, but we
do have some freedom to negotiate the salary.

Please send resumes and letters of interest to
