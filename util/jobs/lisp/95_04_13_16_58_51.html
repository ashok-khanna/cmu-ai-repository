             ILOG IS LOOKING FOR A GREAT LISP IMPLEMENTOR
             ============================================
 
Ilog, SA, located just outside Paris, France, is looking for a highly
motivated and highly skilled full-time permanent software developer to
join the Ilog Talk development team.  Ilog is a leading supplier of
high-level software components.  Ilog's headquarters are in Gentilly,
France, and it has subsidiaries in Mt. View, CA, Singapore, England,
and Spain, and distribution partners worldwide.
 
Ilog Talk is a new, modern dialect of Lisp based on ISO Lisp and
EuLisp.  It focuses on a full integration with C++ libraries and
simplifying application delivery through an automatically managed
module system.  You can find out more about Ilog Talk on Ilog's Web
server at:
 
   <URL:http://www.ilog.com/
 
The position would entail (among other things):
 
* Major new development on the compiler, interpreter, object-oriented
  layer, and basic runtime libraries.
 
* Ports to new systems including Windows 95.
 
* Training, maintenance, technical and marketing support, and
  documentation of the product.
 
* Integration of Talk with C++ libraries, including Solver, Ilog's
  constraint programming library, and Broker, Ilog's distributed
  computing library.
 
The compensation is very competitive on the French scale, and you
would be working with some of Europe's best developers right outside
Paris.  Most employees live in Paris, and commuting on public
transport is easy.
 
French citizenship is not required. Speaking French would not be
strictly necessary at the outset, but the candidate must be willing to
learn it.
 
We are looking for someone to start as soon as possible.
 
If you are interested in this position, please send a resume in a
reasonable electronic format (dvi, PostScript, ASCII, or HTML) and a
cover letter to:
