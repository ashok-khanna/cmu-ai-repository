Caelum Research Corporation is a sub-contractor at NASA Ames research center
in the south San Francisco Bay area.  We currently have an opening on the
Intelligent Maintenance portion of the X-33 program.  The goal of X-33
program is to build a prototype of the next generation reusable launch
vehicle that will replace the space shuttle in the next decade.  The goal of
the Intelligent Maintenance project is to reduce the time needed to
maintain and refurbish the vehicle between flights through the use of
specialize sensors, vehicle component performance monitoring and automated
maintenance scheduling.  The position is primarily to support the automated
maintenance scheduling, but working in machine learning and problem solving
will also be required.

Applicants must be proficient Lisp and should have experience with C/C++ and
tcl/tk.  Familiarity planning and scheduling technology is also a plus.
Salaries are determined by the qualifications of the applicant and will
probably range somewhere between $25-$65k.

Only US citizens or Green card holders are eligible for this position.
