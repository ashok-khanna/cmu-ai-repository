Every so often I receive a thank you email message from someone who
got a job "because" of one of the AI-related jobs lists.

In addition to the statistics I keep on the number of subscribers and
the number of job postings, I would like to keep statistics on the
number of people who saw a post and ultimately got hired for the position.

If you got hired for a job that you first heard about through one of
these lists, please send an email message to ai+got-job@cs.cmu.edu
with the name of the list (AI-Jobs, Lisp-Jobs, Prolog-Jobs,
AI-PostDoc, AI-PreDoc). Only summary counts for each list will be made
public.
