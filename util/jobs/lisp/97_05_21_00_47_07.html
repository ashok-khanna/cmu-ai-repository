Tired of sending the same old flowers, candy, cards and other typical gifts?

For Father's Day, Mother's Day, birthdays, anniversaries, apologies, peace-
offerings, friendship, Valentine's Day or just to tell someone you care... why not
SEND-A-SONG?

It's as easy as picking up your phone, dialing our 800 number, picking a song, and
sending "song-mail" to anyone you choose -- anywhere in the USA.  Plus it's very
affordable (just $9.95), you can SEND-A-SONG at the very last minute, and you're 
guaranteed a unique gift they've never received before.

For a great gift idea, check out the SEND-A-SONG website at 
http://www.sendasong.inter.net/ for full details.

Note:  If you don't wish to receive additional e-mail about Send-A-Song, please
send an email to sendasong@answerme.com.
