	There is an immediate hiring opportunity for a scientist with
dual-backgrounds in:

	1) neural networks, genetic algorithms, and artificial
           intelligence 
and
	2) electromagnetics, concentrating in phased array antenna
 	   beamforming and control systems.

	The position is at the USAF Rome Laboratory, Hanscom AFB, MA,
and starting salary is around $52K.  Research involves developing and
testing novel intelligent software algorithms for configuring and
optimizing phased array antennas.  Current software testbeds are
written in CLOS and running on Symbolics XL1200 workstations and a Sun
Sparcserver 1000 (under Lucid and Harlequin).  Experience with
NeuralWare, MATLAB, and parallel processors is also a plus.
Applicants should have a degree in professional engineering, and
experience in electrical engineering, and planning and conducting
research. 

	This position needs to be filled ASAP, as the closing date
for applications is December 28th.  If you are interested and would
like more information, please call, email, or fax resumes to either:
