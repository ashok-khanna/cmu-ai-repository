We are seeking an individual to join the Software Infrastructure
Department, whose charter is to do R&D to help the corporation wisely
use information technology to meet its enterprise objectives. My group
is interested in developing methods and tools for enterprise modeling
and analysis in the context of Requirements Engineering. In particular,
we are currently working on the design of a novel prototype software
environment for modeling and simulating enterprises.  This involves
integration and application of multiple advanced software technologies;
this may involve knowledge representation and reasoning techniques,
(e.g., constraints, TMS, logic programming), OODBMS, GUI, web-based and
other emerging technologies.  The objective is to advance the
state-of-the-practice in the corporation and the state-of-the-art in
the fields of Requirements Engineering, Information Systems, etc.

The position requires an MS or PhD in Computer Science or related
field, proven design and prototyping skills, and expert skills using
Lisp, Prolog, KBSs, OODBMSs, and also Java and other web
development/integration technologies. Other useful background would
include knowledge in the areas of cooperating/coordinated information
systems, business process modeling, software agents and agent
architectures, enterprise/business architectures, conceptual modeling
of organizations and systems, etc.

GTE Labs, in Waltham, MA, is the central research facility for GTE, one
of the world's largest telecommunications companies, and a major player
in the convergence of communications technologies (local,
long-distance, Internet, wireless, airphone, etc.).

If you are interested in the position, please send your resume
to Sol Greenspan at greenspan@gte.com including the names of at
least two references.
