AIMS

LANGUAGES in CONTRAST aims to publish contrastive studies of two or more
languages.  Any aspect of language may be covered, including vocabulary,
phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, text and discourse,
stylistics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics.  Interdisciplinary
studies are welcomed, particularly those that make links between
contrastive linguistics and translation, lexicography, computational
linguistics, language teaching, literary and linguistic computing,
literary studies and cultural studies.

CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are invited for the first issues of the journal.  Simple
guidelines for contributors have been formulated to make it easy to submit
papers. Please contact the Managing Editor (address below) for details.

WHY A NEW JOURNAL?

Contrastive linguistics needs a home.  After many years of marginal status
in the study of language, the contrastive dimension has recently come back
to life in a big way.  The availability of multilingual corpora has been
an important catalyst.  Parallel (translation) corpora - collections of
texts and their translations into other languages - and comparable corpora
- collections of similar texts in different languages - have both opened
up new areas of research.  Several EU projects (LINGUA, EAGLES and others)
have been devoted in whole or in part to the creation and exploitation of
such resources.  Concordancing and aligning software tools have also begun
to appear.

Research groups with a long tradition of work on monolingual corpora
(Birmingham, Lancaster, Lund, Oslo, etc) have branched out into
multilingual work.   Bilingual lexicographers and computational linguists
have also taken an interest in multilingual corpora.  Because it is now so
easy to obtain contrastive data, interest in some of the old questions of
contrastive linguistics has revived, and it is possible to ask some new
ones.

DEFINING THE FIELD

For many years, studies in contrastive linguistics have occasionally
appeared in books and journals under the heading of translation studies,
applied linguistics, lexicography, and computational linguistics.
Recently such studies have begun to appear in greater number.  

If the field is to develop - and, in the process, contribute more to these
related fields - contrastive research needs an international  journal of
its own.  This will enable the empirical coverage of the field to be
widened and deepened.  Advocates of different theoretical frameworks for
contrastive research will also be able to set out their wares in a single
marketplace, to the benefit of everyone.

LiC WILL:

**  help to give the field of contrastive linguistics a distinct identity.
**  stimulate research into a wide range of languages.
**  provide a forum to explore the theoretical status of the field.
