Cross Platform Applications Builder Engineer $80K - $110K+, Silicon 
Valley

A leader in the software industry is looking for an engineer to help 
build version 1.0 of a cross platform apps builder.  This project will 
use such cutting edge technologies as OLE, OpenDoc, and CORBA.  
Knowledge of multiple platforms and C++ is a requirement.  This is an 
opportunity to work on a hot new project.  Both Architects and 
Implementors are needed.  This project is graphics intensive so 
knowledge of either Smalltalk or Lisp methodologies are a plus.  The 
ability to optimize large strings of code and object linking are also a 
major plus.  This engineer will also need to have some SQL knowledge.  A 
total of 4 positions are open.  If interested, please contact:
