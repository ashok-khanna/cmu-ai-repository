Lisp programmers needed for TECHNOLOGY Interface!

An SRI International spin-off company who is financially backed by SRI is
looking for Lisp programmers capable of building an interface to Java
servlets. This interface will be working with leading edge, Natural Language
Extraction Engine technology as developed by SRI's Artificial Intelligence
Center. My immediate need is to create an interface that connects the
Lisp-developed extraction engine with our on-going servlet development. I
see an excellent opportunity for a qualified Lisp programmer with Java
and/or C++ experience to get involved in the early stages of development.

If you would like more detail regarding these positions, please forward your
resume to kirk@sc.sri.com.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.
