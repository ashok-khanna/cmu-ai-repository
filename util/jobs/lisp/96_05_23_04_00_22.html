Position:       Senior Software Engineer - User Interface
Hiring Manager: Joseph Devlin

Gensym is a leading provider of software products for developing and deploying
intelligent systems for decision support and control.  Our flagship product,
G2, is a graphical object-oriented development environment that helps
organizations quickly solve complex, dynamic applications problems.  Gensym's
commitment to providing best-in-class products through best-in-class employees
has made us one of the world's most interesting and rewarding software
companies.

The User Interface team at Gensym has the goal of creating a new
object-oriented and distributed UI that is fully customizable and programmable
by our end users, while complying with existing industry standards (Windows
32, OLE, and Motif).  We need one more high-quality, experienced (4+ years)
software developer to help us get the job done and do it on time.  Interested
candidates should be proficient in Common Lisp and must have some low-level UI
experience (Win16/32 or XLib).  C/C++ skills would be helpful, as would
experience with OLE.
