A small, privately-held company in the 
Boston area needs a mid to senior level
LISP developer to join a 3-person development 
team, which is responsible for one of this company's 
three product lines.  The product is an expert-system based 
manufacturability product.

The primary focus of the position is development.  
Development work will be on all areas of the product, 
including the following:  database, constraint issues,
compiler issues, rule inferencing engine, n/w, and user 
interface.  The position will also require some interaction with
sales people and customers, documentation work, as well as
occasional small consulting projects.  Development will be 
done in Lisp, C, and C++ on Unix and NT.

This is an excellent opportunity for a strong developer with
an entrepreneurial spirit to work in a small, privately-held company,
with some equity in the company.

Requirements:

Lisp, C, Unix

Would be nice:

C++, Windows NT

The company will relocate the right candidate.
