       The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology
               seeks a Research Scientist
                    Position 95-0553

The Intelligent Information Infrastructure Project seeks a programmer
to maintain, integrate, and develop a variety of large Common Lisp
systems in the areas of intelligent network services, machine
learning, natural language understanding, and knowledge
representation.  A keen sense of program abstraction and system
modularity are essential.  The individual will work with a team on
information infrastructure projects as well as state of the art
artificial intelligence systems.  The position also involves
contributing to the maintenance of the project's computational
infrastructures and teaching programming to students working on the
project.  Most work will be done on Symbolics Lisp machines, with some
ancillary work on UNIX platforms.

For a description of the project, see:

URL: http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/home-page.html

Qualifications: B.S. or M.S. in computer science or related
field, and a demonstrated ability to conceptualize and complete
software engineering projects.  Must be fluent in ANSI Common Lisp,
including the Common Lisp Object System and the Common Lisp Interface
Manager.  Experience with Genera operating system and development
environment on Symbolics Lisp Machines is important.  Familiarity with
operating systems on the Apple MacIntosh, DEC Alpha, and UNIX are a
plus.  Other relevant skills or experience include: transaction-controlled,
persistent-object object systems; database programming; Internet
protocols (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, NNTP, Z39.50).

Qualified applicants, please send a resume to:

Mr. James McCarthy, Personnel Officer
