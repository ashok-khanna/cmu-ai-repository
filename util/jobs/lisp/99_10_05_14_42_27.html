A programmer is needed to assist in the cognitive modeling of human
performance in complex real-time dynamic simulation environments.
Responsibilities include programming interface components between the
simulation and the modeling environment, assisting in the development of
cognitive models of human performance, performing data analysis and
reporting research results.  This position can be either full-time or
part-time.

system (especially ACT-R) programming and cognitive modeling research is
desirable.  For further information on the ACT-R project, see the ACT web
