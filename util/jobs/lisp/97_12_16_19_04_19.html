The Artificial Intelligence Center of SRI International, Menlo Park,
   is seeking to hire a computer scientist to contribute to the
   development of advanced, state-of-the-art prototype systems for
   artificial intelligence applications, especially in natural language
   processing.

   The candidate must be a first-rate programmer and have extensive
   experience with programming in Lisp and C.  Experience in Java is
   also desirable.  A Bachelor's or Master's Degree in Computer
   Science with an emphasis on AI is required.  He or she should be
   self-motivated, innovative, independent, and capable of working
   well alone or in a team.

   The Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International has a
   substantial program of research and system development in the area
   of interpretation and generation of natural language by computers
   and humans.  It is world-renowned for its basic research in the
   areas of grammar formalisms, knowledge representation, reasoning,
   generation, speech acts, dialogue, information extraction, and
   discourse analysis.  Our current activities are focused on text
   processing and on systems that can participate in dialogues with
   complex software systems.
