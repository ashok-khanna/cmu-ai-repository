Background:

The goal of the Amphion project is to make knowledge-based software
enginnering (KBSE) a reality for NASA. KBSE uses techniques from
artificial intelligence and formal methods to raise the level at which
users program to the specification level (what is the problem to be
solved) rather than the detailed code level (how to solve a problem). 
Programs are generated automatically from specifications.

The Amphion system is a general-purpose KBSE system that has been
applied to several NASA domains: space science observation geometries
(Amphion/NAIF), space shuttle navigation (Amphion/TOT), and
computational fluid dynamics (Amphion/CFD). The most mature of these
applications - Amphion/NAIF - has generated software currently in
use by space scientists. One example is a visualizer for the 1995/1996 
Saturn Ring crossing, when Saturn's rings appear edge-on to the earth,
thus providing unique observation opportunities. 

More information can be found on the WWW at 
       http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/amphion/index.html

We are currently expanding Amphion from a research system to a robust
industrial-quality system that will be distributed to various NASA 
user communities.

Job Description and Requirements:

We are seeking an experienced software engineer who has had
significant system-building and customer support responsibilities on 
software projects. The major job responsibilities will be to continue
development and refinement of the user interfaces; system building,
robustifying, and maintenance; and working directly with
customers. In the next year customers will mostly be space
scientists and engineers working on unmanned missions such as 
Galileo (Jupiter), Cassini (Saturn), and Mars Surveyor, and New
Millennium. Secondary responsibilities will be to support and 
participate in research aimed at next-generation KBSE systems.

The base qualification for this job is previous project experience 
building and maintaining UNIX-based software systems, and subsequent
customer support. Experience with Lisp and X-Windows is a plus.
Good candidates should be well organized, highly motivated, and able
to learn quickly. This job offers significant technical growth.
The following is a partial list of sciences and technologies that are 
relevant to this job; we expect most of these to be learned on the job
(please mention previous training or experience):

Solar System Astronomy, celestial mechanics, automated theorem proving,
knowledge representation and acquisition, formal specification languages,
Lisp, CLOS (common lisp object system), user interface technologies 
including Garnet, Motif, HTML (Word Wide Web) and X-WIndows, 
and application languages including Fortran and C++.

Salary will be commensurate with experience and education.
This is a full-time permanent position, available immediately.
US citizenship or green card status is required. The bulk of 
the work will be performed on site at NASA Ames Research Center
in Silicon Valley (the south San Francisco bay area).

To apply:

Please send an electronic copy of a cover-letter and resume
or curriculum vitae (ASCII or Postscript) to

        lowry@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov

If you are unable to send email, a hardcopy of your resume can be 
mailed to:

Dr. Michael Lowry
MS 269-2
NASA Ames Research Center
Moffett Field, CA 94035

Preliminary interviews will be held either by telephone, in the
Silicon Valley area, or at IJCAI'95.
