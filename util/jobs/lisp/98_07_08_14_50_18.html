The Swarm Development Program at the Santa Fe Institute
(http://www.santafe.edu/projects/swarm) is seeking a programmer
experienced with high level programming languages, and specifically,
an individual with practical programming experience with the notion of
`code as data'.

Swarm is a simulation system inspired by the study of complex adaptive
systems, systems that are difficult or impossible to study using
classical reductionist approaches.  Note that although the Santa Fe
Institute is a scientific research environment, this position is
primarily about software development (although for the most part
open-ended and undirected).

JOB DESCRIPTION: Kernel Programmer
                  
  Reports to:      Vice President of Academic Affairs
  Salary Level:    Exempt, Research Technician (37.5 hours per week)
                   $45,000-$50,000 depending on experience
  
  
  SUMMARY

  Integrates Swarm with popular distributed object systems to
  facilitate object-oriented language interoperability and inter-Swarm
  (coarse-grained) parallelization.  Implements and extends
  design for intra-Swarm (fine-grained) parallelization of the Swarm
  kernel.  Helps to implement language and interface support for
  making Swarm usable in popular integrated development environments.
  
  This is an SFI full-time position for one year only, but
  extension may be possible.
  
  JOB REQUIREMENTS
  
  Seven years of programming experience
  Demonstrated experience in some of the following:
     o Implementation of high-level programming languages
     o Distributed systems
     o Concurrent systems
  Prepared to take on any tasks on the critical path
  
 RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  This a software development position. 

  Work to be done includes:
     o Implementation of support for network distribution of hierarchial
       temporal spaces (Swarms).
     o Kernel enhancements for fine-grained parallelization of Swarm
       components
     o Enhancements for multi-processor and multi-host distribution
       of agents spanning configurable multidimensional environments.
     o Development of a hierarchical browser for building and
       inspecting temporal data structures.
     o Enhancements to one or more CORBA implementations to support
       Objective C (also of interest are Scheme and Java).
     o Integration of Swarm with popular integrated development environments
       (especially Java-based environments). 

  The successful candidate will be skilled at identifying,
  understanding, fixing, and preventing performance problems.
