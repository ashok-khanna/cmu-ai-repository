Cycorp is seeking enthusiastic, highly-motivated, multi-talented people
for positions in ontological engineering.  These positions involve
working with and extending the Cyc technology -- an immense, broad,
multi-contextual knowledge base which our group has developed over the
last twelve years.  Cyc already contains a useful selection of
fundamental human knowledge:  facts and heuristics for reasoning about
the objects and events of modern everyday life.  Cyc enables a multitude
of knowledge-intensive products and services which could revolutionize
the way in which people use and interact with computers, and Cycorp is
dedicated to making this happen.  Cyc currently supports ground-breaking
pilot applications in the areas of heterogeneous database browsing and
integration, captioned image retrieval, and natural language
undestanding.   We are looking for a few individuals to join us in this
challenging enterprise.


Those chosen as Ontological Engineers will:
-------------------------------------------
o have a facility with formal logic (predicate calculus)
o be self-motivated, yet work well in a team

Programming ability is a plus, but not required.  Familiarity with AI,
esp. knowledge representation, is also a plus, but not required.

For immediate consideration, send your resume and a cover letter to:
