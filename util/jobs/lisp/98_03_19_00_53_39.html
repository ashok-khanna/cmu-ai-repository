At Afferent Systems, Inc., we're looking for an expert Lisp hacker to
help build software that aids in the discovery of new drugs.

You can read all about what we do at www.afferent.com.  The short
version is, the pharmaceutical industry has recently discovered that
you can make and test candidate drugs a whole lot faster using robots
than by hand.  They are getting a 100x increase in throughput and a
100x decrease in cost.  So a whole lot of money is being spent on
automating drug discovery.

Luckily for us, chemists aren't good at programming robots.  So they
need intelligent software that can talk chemistry to chemists and
robotese to robots.

Also, now that they are making and testing 100x as many chemicals as
previously, they are swamped with data.  Their data management tools
are completely inadequate.

These problems aren't too hard to solve if you know Lisp!  Luckily for
us, we know Lisp, so we're solving the drug discovery industry's
problems, and they are sending us lots of money.  We like that; and
they like it too, because then they get to discover drugs and make a
whole lot more money!

And everyone else benefits, because the current pace of drug discovery
is pathetically slow.  Amazingly, there are more new diseases
discovered every year than there are new drugs.  With pre-robotic
technology, humans are losing and the germs are winning.  Hopefully,
with robots we'll turn this around.

So, what's this got to do with you?  Well, luckily, you know Lisp.  So
maybe you can help...

What we need is an expert Lisp hacker -- someone who has built large
systems, and can produce reliable code quickly.  That probably means
at least a Master's degree in CS and industrial experience, but those
are not absolutely required.

Any of the following additions would be a significant plus:

-- a PhD
-- a background in chemistry or biology
-- expertise in complex GUI programming
-- knowledge of the Windows API
-- familiarity with tcl/tk 
-- background in relational databases (ODBC, SQL, Oracle)

We'll invent a title for you depending on your background and what
exactly you are going to be doing.  (Small companies can be flexible
in giving people snazzy titles.)

We're looking for a full-time person (or maybe two), but may have work
for a contractor as well.

Afferent is a small startup located in San Francisco.

If you are interested, send me a resume via email
(chapman@afferent.com) or fax (415-252-8610) or to 2005 16th Street,
San Francisco CA 94103.
