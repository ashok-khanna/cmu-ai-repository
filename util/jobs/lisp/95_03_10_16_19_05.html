Subject: Admin: Subscription Requests
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

There was a bug in the mailing list filter that prevented it from
filtering out certain kinds of subscription requests. This bug has
been fixed.

Also, the mailing lists are large enough now (450 on AI-Jobs, 435 on
Lisp-Jobs, 152 on Prolog-Jobs) that I cannot track down mail bounces.
If mail to your email address bounces for any reason, the email
address will be removed from the mailing list. If, after a service
failure at your end, you find yourself no longer receiving job
announcements, try resubscribing. If your mailer tacks on a bad return
address, use the MAIL command to specify a reliable email address. For
example,  
   mail foo@cs.bar.edu
   subscribe ai-jobs John Foo, Bar University
will set up a subscription for foo@cs.bar.edu and send a confirmation
message to foo@cs.bar.edu.
