AutoLISP Program for Drawing of Jib Crane in AutoCAD.

I have developed a AutoLISP based program for design and drawing of Jib
Crane, with user friendly dialog boxes, which is an add-on for AutoCAD
Rel 12 to 2000, for developing GA drawing as well as component wise
drawings with Bill of Material and weights of all components for Jib
Crane. The program asks for some parameters and then automatically draws
separate drawings for each component giving Bill of materials for that
component as well as weight of each sub-component and also total weight.
It then draws GA Drawing with total weight of Jib Crane. The software
gives all minor details for fabrication of Jib Crane at Quotation Stage
itself and this helps to quote in most competitive manner.

I have prepared a demo which shows 20 cases for the top beam and 20
cases for bottom beam. In first 4 cases capacity is 250 Kgs, while the
crane radius is 3, 4, 5 and 6 meters. In next 4 cases capacity is 500
kgs, in next 4 cases capacity is 1,000 Kgs, in next 4 cases capacity is
2,000 Kgs and in next 4 cases capacity is 3,000 Kgs with corresponding
radius. The lift is 3 meters in all the cases. The maximum lift range is
5 meters.

If you want to try our program, Download Trial Jib Crane Program from
our site at http://business.vsnl.com/nelcon/jib.htm

To run the demo copy jib.zip file in acad support directory (or any
other directory defined in AutoCAD path settings) and unzip it. It
contains jib.lsp, jib.dcl program files and A1, A2, A3, A4 prototype
drawings and other drawings. Load jib.lsp by appload. At command prompt
type jib and press <enter> and demo will start. This is a fully
functional program but converted to demo.

Drawings developed by the program are as follows :
A Complete GA Drawing of Jibcrane
A Drawing of Pillar.
A Drawing of Jib Frame.
A Drawing of Pivot.
A Drawing of Stopper Bracket.
A Drawing of Cable Angle.
A Drawing of Friction Disc.
A Drawing of Pressure Pad.
A Drawing of Bottom Bracket.
A Drawing of Top Bracket.
A Drawing of Bearing Cover.
A Drawing of Bill of Materials.

I can develop programs for your company too, sitting down in our office
on interactive basis via E Mail or I can take up an assignment to be
done in your office. If you are looking for such services please contact
me on mailto:lele@vsnl.com for more information.
