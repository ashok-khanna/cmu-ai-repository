     LISP/AI/Process Planning Job Opportunity - Northrop Grumman/Charleston
     
     
     Job 
     Description
     
     
        The Northrop Grumman Corporation has an excellent opportunity for a 
     software engineer to work on a "leading edge" process planning 
     software development program.  This position is located in Charleston, 
     South Carolina.
     
        The Generative Process Planning Environment  (GPPE) is a 
     "Cornerstone" of the DoD's Rapid Acquisition of Manufactured Parts 
     (RAMP) Program.  The GPPE is a feature-based STEP-driven 
     State-of-the-Art process planning system. This position involves the 
     enhancement of the GPPE to include feature recognition and  other 
     advanced process planning capabilities as well as implementing the 
     emerging ISO STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) 
     Application Protocol (AP224) ("Mechanical Part Definition for Process 
     Planning Using Machining Features").  The successful applicant will be 
     responsible for providing technical participation, leadership and 
     direction for the next generations of the GPPE.   
     
     
     Qualifications:
     
        The ideal candidate should possess an Engineering degree  
     (preferably Mechanical) or a Computer Science degree (or equivalent) 
     with experience in software design and project leadership.  This 
     person should be self motivated with good communication skills.  
     He/She should have at least 3 - 5 years of relevant experience which 
     includes a minimum 2 - 3 years of LISP programming (preferably in an 
     ICAD (or knowledge based) development environment).   Process Planning 
     and Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems,  rule-based 
     systems,  solid modeling, and feature recognition experience are 
     highly desirable.   Some C programming and data base systems 
     experience would be helpful.    A working knowledge of STEP would be a 
     Big Plus.
     
        Salary will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.
