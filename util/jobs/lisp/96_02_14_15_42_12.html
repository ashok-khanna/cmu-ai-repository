Subject: No. Cal:  Research Programmer position at NASA Ames Research Center
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

[While not specifically a Lisp job, this position requires a familarity
with Common Lisp. -- Chuck]

Position:      Research Programmer
Project:       Operations Scheduling

One position for a research programmer is available with the Operations
Scheduling project in the Computational Sciences Division at NASA Ames
Research Center. The research and development work of the Operations
Scheduling project is aimed at a problem of vital importance for the US
space program: dramatically reducing space mission operating costs
through the use of automation and Artificial Intelligence software
technology. We are currently working on an on-board automatic planner
for the New Millenium DS-1 mission. DS-1 will be the first planetary mission
to fly in complete autonomy performing an asteroid flyby mission.
The successful candidate will be joining a highly motivated team in the 
development of the flight planner.

The successful candidate must satisfy the following requirements:

- American citizenship or permanent residency (this is strong requisite)
- BS/MS (or experiential equivalent) in Computer Science or related
  fields;
- good working knowledge of C++, C and Unix;
- good written and verbal skills.

The following skills will be consider as definite advantages for
the successful candidate:

- familiarity with Lisp;
- familiarity with search techniques, constraint propagation, operations
  research, planning and scheduling;
- experience with the development of object-oriented systems;

Motivation to learn quickly about the previous topics is a definite
requirement.

The NASA Ames Research Center is located near Mountain View, in
northern California. The position offers a competitive compensation
package, excellent benefits, the opportunity to join a well-motivated,
hard-working team, and the chance to directly impact the future of the
US space program.
