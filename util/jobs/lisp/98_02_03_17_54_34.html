Cycorp, a leader in development of software with common sense, has
opportunities for 1 or 2 individuals to join our NLP effort.

These positions involve working with the Cyc(TM) technology -- an
immense, broad, multi-contextual knowledge base which our group has
developed over the last fourteen years.  The Cyc(TM) knowledge base,
spanning fundamental human knowledge, enables a multitude of
knowledge-intensive products and services which will revolutionize the
way in which people use and interact with computers: semantic
information retrieval, consistency-checking of structured information,
deductive integration of heterogeneous data bases, natural language
interfaces able to cope with realistic levels of
ambiguity/terseness/contextualization, and many more.

We are looking for enthusiastic individuals to contribute to our
natural language interface for Cyc.  We are particularly interested in
candidates with several of the following kinds of experience and
abilities:

o Strong programming skills in C, C++, or Lisp
o Familiarity with NL parsing theory (including statistical
  and/or corpus-based parsing methods and other methods)
o Experience in designing, building, and extending parsers
o Knowledge of discourse structure, pragmatics, and dialog modeling
o Experience in natural language generation
o Knowledge of NL interfaces for information retrieval
o Familiarity with knowledge representation, predicate calculus,
  and other AI tools and techniques

Successful applicants will be instrumental in designing and
implementing an interactive dialog system and other interface tools
for information retrieval, database integration, knowledge entry, and
ontological integration.  They will work with Cycorp's diverse team of
linguists, programmers, and ontological engineers to improve our
existing natural language capabilities and create prototypes of
commercial products incorporating NLP and Cyc's common sense knowledge
and reasoning.

letter to:
