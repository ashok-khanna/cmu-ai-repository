The aspect-oriented programming project at PARC still has one position
open for a skilled programming language implementor.

This a great opportunity for someone who knows what is great about Lisp,
and wants to contribute to improving the larger world of programming
languages, but wants to take at least something of a timeout from the
Lisp fight itself.  (That's my personal situation!)

The offical job description follows.


Programming Language Implementor:

This person will be responsible for the implementation of our AspectJ
system.  Experience architecting a dynamic prototype system and
responding to user requests on a timely basis is required. Experience
implementing programming languages is required. The current
implementation is in Common Lisp, but we plan to port to Java, so
experience with Lisp and Java is plus.


Please email Tina Silva (tsilva@parc.xerox.com) with a copy of your
resume and at least two references.  Alternatively, you can fax this
information to (650) 812-4334, c/o Tina Silva.
