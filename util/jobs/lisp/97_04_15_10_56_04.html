Computer Scientist supporting research in Music Cognition
At the Nijmegen Institute of Cognition and Information (NICI) of the
Nijmegen University a new research team will be set up, supported by the
Dutch Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO) as the PIONIER project
"Music, Mind, Machine". This project aims at improving the understanding of
the temporal aspects of musical knowledge and music cognition using
computational models. A multi-disciplinary research group will be formed,
in which collaboration plays a crucial role. A position for a Computer
Scientist is available (vacancy number 21.2.97). Experience in Common Lisp
and CLOS is requested. Knowledge of the Macintosh system, MIDI and audio
applications is an advantage. He/she will assist in the development of
cognitive models and demonstration programs, the setup and maintenance of
system software and the design of WWW applications. Appointment will be
full-time for five years. The salary, depending on experience, will be
between DFL 3844 and DFL 7125 gross per month.
More information on the project and a description of the planned studies
can be found at http://www.nici.kun.nl/mmm/. Employment will begin July
1997. The Faculty of Social Sciences intends to employ a proportionate
number of women and men in all positions in the faculty. Women are
therefore urgently invited to apply. The selection procedure may entail an
assessment of collaboration and communication skills.

about the candidate's professional interests and goals, and one copy of
recent work (e.g., thesis, computer program, article) should be received
before May 31st, 1997 by the Department of Personnel & Organization,
