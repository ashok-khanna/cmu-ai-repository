Subject: Job: LISP Prototyper sought
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU


Expert LISP developer needed to collaborate on UI design and to implement
prototype of an innovative, knowledge-based product destined for commercial
release.

Grasp Information, a venture-capital-backed software company, develops and
markets "knowledge organization" software.  Its Release 1.0 product allows
individuals to capture, organize and understand information extracted from
the Web, e-mail, newsgroups, on-line  services, CD-ROM and other electronic
sources. (Release 1.0 for PC is available for download at www.grasp.com,
along with further information about the Company.)

Plans for Release 2.0 are very ambitious and demand innovation in
ease-of-use for commercial desktop applications. The development process
will be based on rapid-prototyping and close-coupling of product goals,
software development and alpha users. Target platform for 2.0 prototype may
be Mac or PC. Experience in developing heavily UI-oriented software in same
or equivalent environments is a requirement.

Prototyper must be able to work quickly from an existing spec as well as
contribute creatively to the functions and UI of the product. Prototyper is
expected to work initially on a contract basis, with possibility for future
employment if appropriate. Present estimates of schedule and degree of
effort implicates the equivalent of full-time work over two to three
months, with work to begin ASAP. Current UI design spec will be made
available under non-disclosure for evaluation and quotation purposes.
Potential candidates will be expected to demo their relevant LISP
implementations. Please provide resumes and references to Paul Pangaro,
ppangaro@grasp.com or 617-489-9500.
