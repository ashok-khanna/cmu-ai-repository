                        POSITION AVAILABLE

Position:       Software Engineer, Geometric Modeling

Reports To:     Manager, DPA Product Engineering

Education/Experience:
o       BS or higher in Computer Science or a related engineering discipline.
o       2+ years experience in geometric modeling.
o       Experience with parametric CAD systems or other geometric modelers.
            Experience with Unigraphics, CATIA, ProEngineer, CADDS,
Parasolid, ACIS or DCM are especially relevant.
o       Experience developing applications in both Unix and Windows
environments.
o       Working knowledge of Lisp.
o       High level of entrepreneurial energy.

Responsibilities Include:
The individual in this position will be responsible for designing and
implementing sub-systems of Concentra's modeling system.  Concentra
provides the industry leading language for describing geometric objects. We
are looking for an individual to assist us in  modeling geometric objects
more easily and more accurately.  This individual will also be responsible
for insuring that these objects can be accurately transferred to CAD
systems.  

The Company:
Concentra Corporation develops, markets and supports software products that
automate the engineering process.  A significant portion of the time it
takes to develop new products goes into performing well defined, repetitive
engineering tasks, optimizing designs across multiple disciplines and
building, testing and modifying prototypes.  This new approach enables
companies to capture the way engineering practices are performed and
generate new designs directly from functional specifications.  As a result,
engineering productivity and time to market are improved as engineers
automate repetitive but time consuming tasks and are able to spend more
time on valuable, creative work.
