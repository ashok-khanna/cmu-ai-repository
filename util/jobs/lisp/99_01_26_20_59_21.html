We're looking for at least one expert Common Lisp programmer interested in
joining our research group.  Initially, the main job would be to help
implement a prototype suite of tools for transformational development and
analysis of hierarchies of software architecture descriptions.  (For more
information on what the heck I'm talking about, check out our web site,
<http://www.csl.sri.com/dsa/>.)  In the longer term, we expect that the
main focus of the group will be on tools to support development and
analysis of complex systems built from components and application of those
tools to hard problems.  Exactly how the person, or people, we hire will
fit in will depend on his, her, or their skills and interests.

With the exception of substantial experience with Common Lisp, there are
no hard-and-fast requirements for the position(s).  But knowledge of and
experience in any of the following areas would be a plus:

  -- formal methods (our analysis tools use theorem provers and model
     checkers) 

  -- transformational development of software

  --  CORBA, DCOM, ActiveX, JavaBeans, et al.

If this sounds intriguing, you can send me some questions to figure out
whether you might be interested or -- if you're really excited -- go ahead
and send a resume.
