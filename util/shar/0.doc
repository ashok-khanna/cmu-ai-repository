Summary:      Shell Archiving Program

Version:      

Description: 

   SHAR (SHell ARchiver) is a UNIX utility for archiving files. Obviously,
   this causes problems for non-UNIX systems. Although we've repackaged
   most shar files as tar files, we've included unshar programs for DOS
   and Macintosh just in case.

   Extensions:

       shar     Shell Archives
       shr      Shell Archives
       sh       Shell Archives

Requires:
