Subject:  v15i035:  Tools to create and unpack shell archives, Patch2
Newsgroups: comp.sources.unix,comp.sources.bugs
Summary: This is an official patch for cshar 2.0; please apply it.
Approved: rsalz@uunet.UU.NET

Submitted-by: Rich $alz <rsalz@bbn.com>
Posting-number: Volume 15, Issue 35
Archive-name: cshar/patch2


Description:
    From: Bob Mitchell <kid@right.cs.washington.edu>
    +Unshar doesn't properly cd to the specified directory, leaving
     unpacked files in the directory it was started from.

Fix:
    To aid in robustness, patches are not shipped "raw"; I apologize for
    the inconvenience.  Save this message and unshar it; from rn, say
    "|unshar -d DIR", where DIR is your cshar source directory.  Outside
    of rn, say "cd DIR; unshar <thisarticle".  This will create a file
    called patch01, which you can then feed to the patch program.

    If you don't have the patch program, make the changes by hand, or get
    patch.

    If patch indicates that patchlevel is the wrong version, you may need
    to apply one or more previous patches, or the patch may already have
    been applied.  See the patchlevel.h file to find out what has or has
    not been applied.  In any event, don't continue with the patch.

    If any patches are missing, they can be obtained from your nearest
    comp.sources.unix archive.

#! /bin/sh
# This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line, then unpack
# it by saving it into a file and typing "sh file".  To overwrite existing
# files, type "sh file -c".  You can also feed this as standard input via
# unshar, or by typing "sh <file", e.g..  If this archive is complete, you
# will see the following message at the end:
#		"End of shell archive."
