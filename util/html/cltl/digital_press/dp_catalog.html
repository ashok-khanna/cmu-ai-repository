<h3>OpenVMS AXP Internals and Data Structures </h3>

Ruth E. Goldenberg and <br>
Saro Saravanan, <br>
both of Digital Equipment Corporation<br>

<P>

This outstanding new book describes the internals and data structures
of the OpenVMS AXP operating system Version 1.5 in vivid detail.
Perhaps the most comprehensive and up-to-date description available
for a commercial operating system, it is an irreplaceable reference
for operating system development engineers, operating system
troubleshooting experts, systems programmers, consultants and customer
support specialists.

<P>

Some of the text and much of the book's structure are derived from its
highly successful predecessor, VAX/VMS Internals and Data Structures:
Version 5.2. The new work is divided into nine parts: Introduction;
Control Mechanisms; Synchronization; Scheduling and Time Support;
Memory Management; Input/Output; Life of a Process; Life of the
System; and Miscellaneous Topics. Each of the 39 chapters is akin to a
case study on the topic it covers, based on the depth and breadth of
treatment. Although the descriptions are of the OpenVMS operating
system for the Alpha AXP family of processors, the concepts are
equally applicable to the internals of any modern-day multiprocessing
operating system running on a RISC computer.

Experts who have been directly involved in engineering, teaching,
troubleshooting, and supporting the VMS operating system since its
creation bring you this totally revised edition of this landmark
reference.  Comprehensive and convenient, the book focuses on the
kernel of the VAX/VMS Version 5.2 operating system: process
management; memory management; the I/O subsystem; the mechanisms that
transfer control to, from, and among these; and the system services
that support and complement them.  Written for professionals using VMS
who wish to understand the components, mechanisms, and data
structures, the book reflects every change to the VAX/VMS operating
system through Version 5.2.  An all-new detailed technical index and

NAS (Network Applications Support) is both a comprehensive
architecture and set of software products designed to provide a
framework that makes it possible for applications developers to
enhance those characteristics of computing applications that promote
interoperability, application distributability, and application
portability among applications that run on Digital's computing
platforms as well as those from other vendors, such as IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, SunMicrosystems, Apple Computer, and others.  For
managers, executives, and information systems staff, NAS describes
both types of NAS products - 1) those that comprise a set of
development toolkits that provide services directly to computing
applications; both Digital applications and user-written applications.
This important new class of software, called middleware, operates as
an intermediary between application programs and the underlying
hardware/software platform, and 2) those that build on the NAS
middleware to provide services directly to the end users of computing
services.

Project Athena at MIT has emerged as one of the most important models
to date for next-generation distributed computing in an academic
environment, and this book is the first to describe this landmark
project.  Pioneered by MIT in partnership with Digital and IBM,
Project Athena is distinguished by its magnitude and its reliance on
workstations, each providing the same user interface regardless of
architecture, and each sharing the same programs and data through a
high-speed electronic network.  Based on thousands of pages of reports
and the author's own experience, this important book lets you in on
the design, implementation, and performance of Project Athena - now a
production system of networked workstations that is replacing
time-sharing (which MIT also pioneered) as the preferred model of
computing at MIT.  The book is organized in four parts, covering
management, pedagogy, technology, and administration.  Appendixes
describe deployment of Project Athena systems at five other schools,
provide guidelines for installation, and recommend end-user policies.

<H3>GETTING THE JOB DONE WITH WORDPERFECT FOR WINDOWS</H3>
Andrew-Glyn Smail

<P>

The majority of books written on WordPerfect focus on the program
rather than on your work; on the tool rather than the job.  GETTING
THE JOB DONE WITH WORDPERFECT FOR WINDOWS is for the user whose job is
to produce office documents in a business or other professional
environment and is already familiar with the basis of word processing.
It explains program functions within the context of recognizable tasks
and jobs, such as the creation of memos and letters.  It is based on
Windows 3.1 and WordPerfect for Windows but DOS users of WordPerfect
will also find this book a valuable source.
