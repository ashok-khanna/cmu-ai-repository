<P>
Symbols are used as names of variables in Common Lisp programs.
When a symbol is evaluated as a form, the value of the variable it names
is produced.  For example, after doing <tt>(setq items 3)</tt>, which assigns
the value <tt>3</tt> to the variable named <tt>items</tt>, then <tt>items</tt> => <tt>3</tt>.
Variables can be <i>assigned</i> to, as by <tt>setq</tt>, or <i>bound</i>,
as by <tt>let</tt>.
Any program construct that binds a variable effectively saves the old
value of the variable and causes it to have a new value, and on exit from
the construct the old value is reinstated.
<P>
There are actually two kinds of variables in Common Lisp, called <i>lexical</i> (or
<i>static</i>) variables and <i>special</i> (or <i>dynamic</i>) variables.
At any given time either or both kinds of variable with the same name may
have a current value.  Which of the two kinds of variable is referred to
when a symbol is evaluated depends on the context of the evaluation.
The general rule is that if the symbol occurs textually within a program
construct that creates a <i>binding</i> for a variable of the same name,
then the reference is to the variable specified by the binding;
if no such program construct textually contains the reference, then
it is taken to refer to the special variable of that name.
<P>
The distinction between the two kinds of variable is one of scope
and extent.  A lexically bound variable can be referred to <i>only</i>
by forms occurring at any <i>place</i> textually within the program construct that
binds the variable.  A dynamically bound (special) variable can
be referred to at any <i>time</i> from the time the binding is made
until the time evaluation of the construct that binds the variable
terminates.  Therefore lexical binding of variables
imposes a spatial limitation
on occurrences of references (but no temporal limitation, for the
binding continues to exist as long as the possibility of reference
remains).  Conversely, dynamic binding of variables imposes a temporal
limitation on occurrences of references (but no spatial limitation).
For more information on scope and extent, see chapter <A HREF="node43.html#SCOPE">3</A>.
<P>
The value a special variable has when there are currently
no bindings of that variable is called the <i>global</i> value of the
(special) variable.
A global value can be given to a variable only by assignment,
because a value given by binding is by definition not global.
<P>
It is possible for a special variable to have no value at all,
in which case it is said to be <i>unbound</i>.
By default, every global variable is unbound unless and until
explicitly assigned a value, except for those global variables
defined in this book or by the implementation already to have values
when the Lisp system is first started.
It is also possible to establish a binding of a special variable
and then cause that binding to be valueless by using the
function <tt>makunbound</tt>.  In this situation the variable
is also said to be ``unbound,'' although this is a misnomer;
precisely speaking, it is bound but valueless.
It is an error to refer to a variable that is unbound.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (UNDEFINED-VARIABLES-AND-FUNCTIONS) <A NAME=3008>&#160;</A> 
to specify more precisely the effects of referring to an unbound variable.
<P>
  Reading an unbound variable or an undefined function
  must be detected in the highest safety setting (see the
  <tt>safety</tt> quality of the <tt>optimize</tt> declaration specifier)
  but the effect is undefined in any other safety setting. That is,
   reading an unbound variable should signal an error and
   reading an undefined function should signal an error.
  (``Reading a function'' includes
  both references to the function using the <tt>function</tt>
  special form, such as <tt>f</tt> in <tt>(function f)</tt>, and references to the
  function in a call, such as <tt>f</tt> in <tt>(f x y)</tt>.)
<P>
  For the case of <tt>inline</tt> functions (in implementations where they are
  supported), a permitted point of view is that performing the inlining
  constitutes the read of the function, so that an <tt>fboundp</tt>
  check need not be done at
  execution time. Put another way, the effect of the application of
  <tt>fmakunbound</tt> to a function name
  on potentially inlined references to that function is undefined.
<P>
  When an unbound variable 
  is detected an error of type <tt>unbound-variable</tt> is signaled,
  and the <tt>name</tt> slot of the
  <tt>unbound-variable</tt> condition is initialized to the name of the
  offending variable.
<P>
  When an undefined function
  is detected an error of type <tt>undefined-function</tt> is signaled,
  and the <tt>name</tt> slot of the
  <tt>undefined-function</tt> condition is initialized to the name of the
  offending function.
<P>
  The condition type <tt>unbound-slot</tt>, which inherits from
  <tt>cell-error</tt>, has an additional slot <tt>instance</tt>, which
  can be initialized using the <tt>:instance</tt> keyword to <tt>make-condition</tt>.
  The function <tt>unbound-slot-instance</tt> accesses this slot.
<P>
  The type of error signaled by the default primary
  method for the CLOS <tt>slot-unbound</tt> generic function is <tt>unbound-slot</tt>.
  The <tt>instance</tt> slot
  of the <tt>unbound-slot</tt> condition is initialized to the offending instance
  and the <tt>name</tt> slot is initialized
  to the name of the offending variable.

<P>
Certain global variables are reserved as ``named constants.''
They have a global value and may not be bound or assigned to.
For example,
the symbols <tt>t</tt> and <tt>nil</tt> are reserved.
One may not assign a value to <tt>t</tt> or <tt>nil</tt>,
and one may not bind <tt>t</tt> or <tt>nil</tt>.  The global value of
<tt>t</tt> is always <tt>t</tt>, and the global value of
<tt>nil</tt> is always <tt>nil</tt>.  Constant symbols defined by
<tt>defconstant</tt> also become reserved and may not be further
assigned to or bound (although they may be redefined, if necessary, by
using <tt>defconstant</tt> again).  Keyword symbols,
which are notated with a leading colon, are reserved and
may never be assigned to or bound; a keyword always evaluates
to itself.
