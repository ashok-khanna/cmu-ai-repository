<P>
<A NAME=TIMESECTION>Time</A>
is represented in three different ways in Common Lisp:
Decoded Time, Universal Time, and Internal Time.
The first two representations
are used primarily to represent calendar time and are
precise only to one second.
Internal Time is used primarily to represent measurements of computer
time (such as run time) and is precise to some implementation-dependent
fraction of a second, as specified by <tt>internal-time-units-per-second</tt>.
Decoded Time format is used only for absolute time indications.
Universal Time and Internal Time formats are used for both absolute
and relative times.
<P>
Decoded Time format represents calendar time as a number of components:
<UL><LI>
<i>Second</i>: an integer between 0 and 59, inclusive.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Minute</i>: an integer between 0 and 59, inclusive.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Hour</i>: an integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Date</i>: an integer between 1 and 31, inclusive (the upper limit actually
depends on the month and year, of course).
<P>
<LI>
<i>Month</i>: an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; 1 means January,
12 means December.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Year</i>: an integer indicating the year A.D.  However, if this integer
is between 0 and 99, the ``obvious'' year is used; more precisely,
that year is assumed that is equal to the integer modulo 100 and
within fifty years of the current year (inclusive backwards
and exclusive forwards).  Thus, in the year 1978, year 28 is 1928
but year 27 is 2027.  (Functions that return time in this format always return
a full year number.)
</UL>
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> This is incompatible with the Lisp Machine Lisp definition
in two ways.  First, in Lisp Machine Lisp a year between 0 and 99 always has 1900
added to it.  Second, in Lisp Machine Lisp time functions return the abbreviated
year number between 0 and 99 rather than the full year number.  The
incompatibility is prompted by the imminent arrival of the twenty-first
century.  Note that <tt>(mod <i>year</i> 100)</tt> always reliably converts a
year number to the abbreviated form, while the inverse conversion can be
very difficult.
<hr>
<P>
<UL><LI>
<i>Day-of-week</i>: an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive;
0 means Monday, 1 means Tuesday, and so on; 6 means Sunday.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Daylight-saving-time-p</i>: a flag that, if not <tt>nil</tt>, indicates that
daylight saving time is in effect.
<P>
<LI>
<i>Time-zone</i>: an integer specified as the number of hours west of GMT
(Greenwich Mean Time).  For example, in Massachusetts the time zone is 5,
and in California it is 8.  Any adjustment for daylight saving time is
separate from this.
</UL>
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER) <A NAME=29143>&#160;</A> 
to specify that the time zone part of Decoded Time need not be an integer,
but may be any rational number (either an integer or a ratio)
in the range -24 to 24 (inclusive on both ends)
that is an integral multiple of <tt>1/3600</tt>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Rationale:</b> For all possible time designations to be accommodated, it is
    necessary to allow the time zone to be non-integral, for some places
    in the world have time standards offset from Greenwich Mean Time
    by a non-integral number of hours.
<P>
    There appears to be no user demand for floating-point time zones.  Since such
    zones would introduce inexact arithmetic, X3J13 did not consider
    adding them at this time.
<P>
This specification does require time zones to be represented as integral multiples
    of 1 second (rather than 1 hour).  This prevents problems that could otherwise
occur in converting Decoded Time to Universal Time.

<P>
Universal Time represents time as a single non-negative integer.
For relative time
purposes, this is a number of seconds.  For absolute time, this is the
number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1900 GMT.  Thus the time 1
is 00:00:01 (that is, 12:00:01 A.M.) on January 1, 1900 GMT.
Similarly, the time 2398291201 corresponds to time 00:00:01 on January 1,
1976 GMT.
Recall that the year 1900 was <i>not</i> a leap year; for the purposes of
Common Lisp, a year is a leap year if and only if its number is divisible by 4, except
that years divisible by 100 are <i>not</i> leap years, except that years
divisible by 400 <i>are</i> leap years.  Therefore the year 2000 will
be a leap year.
(Note that the ``leap seconds'' that
are sporadically inserted by the world's official timekeepers as an additional
correction are ignored; Common Lisp assumes that every day is exactly 86400
seconds long.)
Universal Time format is used as a standard time
representation within the ARPANET; see reference [<A HREF="node368.html#KLHTIMESERVER">22</A>].
Because the Common Lisp Universal Time representation uses only
non-negative integers, times before the base time of midnight,
January 1, 1900 GMT cannot be processed by Common Lisp.
<P>
Internal Time also represents time as a single integer, but
in terms of an implementation-dependent unit.
Relative time is measured as a number of these units.
Absolute time is relative to an arbitrary time base, typically
the time at which the system began running.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>get-decoded-time</tt><P>The current time is returned in Decoded Time format.  Nine values
are returned: <i>second</i>, <i>minute</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>month</i>,
<i>year</i>, <i>day-of-week</i>, <i>daylight-saving-time-p</i>, and <i>time-zone</i>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> In Lisp Machine Lisp <i>time-zone</i> is not currently returned.
Consider, however, the use of Common Lisp in some mobile vehicle.
It is entirely plausible that the time zone might change from time to time.
<hr>
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>get-universal-time</tt><P>The current time of day is returned as a single integer
in Universal Time format.

<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>decode-universal-time <i>universal-time</i> &amp;optional <i>time-zone</i></tt><P>The time specified by <i>universal-time</i> in Universal Time format
is converted to Decoded Time format.  Nine values
are returned: <i>second</i>, <i>minute</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>month</i>,
<i>year</i>, <i>day-of-week</i>, <i>daylight-saving-time-p</i>, and <i>time-zone</i>.

The <i>time-zone</i> argument defaults to the current time zone.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME-DAYLIGHT) <A NAME=29189>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>decode-universal-time</tt>,
like <tt>encode-universal-time</tt>, ignores daylight saving time information
if a <i>time-zone</i> is explicitly specified; in this case
the returned <i>daylight-saving-time-p</i> value will necessarily be
<tt>nil</tt> even if daylight saving time happens to be in effect in that
time zone at the specified time.

<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>encode-universal-time <i>second</i> <i>minute</i> <i>hour</i> <i>date</i> <i>month</i> <i>year</i> &amp;optional <i>time-zone</i> </tt><P>The time specified by the given components of Decoded Time format is
encoded into Universal Time format and returned.  If you do not specify
<i>time-zone</i>, it defaults to the current time zone adjusted for daylight
saving time.  If you provide <i>time-zone</i> explicitly, no adjustment for
daylight saving time is performed.
<P>
<BR><b>[Constant]</b><BR>
<tt>internal-time-units-per-second</tt><P>This value is an integer, the implementation-dependent
number of internal time units in a second.  (The internal time unit must
be chosen so that one second is an integral multiple of it.)
<P>
<hr>
<b>Rationale:</b> The reason for allowing the internal time
units to be implementation-dependent is so that
<tt>get-internal-run-time</tt> and <tt>get-internal-real-time</tt>
can execute with minimum overhead.
The idea is that it should be very likely that a fixnum will suffice as the
returned value from these functions.  This probability can be
tuned to the implementation by trading off the speed of the machine
against the word size.  Any particular unit will
be inappropriate for some implementations: a microsecond is too long
for a very fast machine, while a much smaller unit would
force many implementations to return bignums for most calls
to <tt>get-internal-time</tt>, rendering that function less useful for accurate
timing measurements.
<hr>
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>get-internal-run-time</tt><P>The current run time is returned as a single integer in Internal Time
format.
The precise meaning of this quantity is implementation-dependent;
it may measure real time, run time, CPU cycles, or some other quantity.
The intent is that the difference between the values of two calls
to this function be the amount of time between the two calls
during which computational effort was expended on behalf of the
executing program.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>get-internal-real-time</tt><P>The current time is returned as a single integer in Internal Time
format.  This time is relative to an arbitrary time base,
but the difference between the values of two calls
to this function will be the amount of elapsed real time between the two calls,
measured in the units defined by <tt>internal-time-units-per-second</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>sleep <i>seconds</i></tt><P><tt>(sleep <i>n</i>)</tt> causes execution to cease and become dormant for
approximately <i>n</i> seconds of real time, whereupon execution is resumed.
The argument may be any non-negative non-complex number.
<tt>sleep</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>.
