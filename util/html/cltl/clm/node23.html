<P>
The treatment of line divisions is one of the most difficult issues
in designing portable software, simply because there is so little agreement
among operating systems.  Some use a single character to delimit lines;
the recommended ASCII character for this purpose is the line feed character
LF (also called the new line character, NL),
but some systems use the carriage
return character CR.  Much more common is the two-character sequence
CR followed by LF.  Frequently line divisions have no representation
as a character but are implicit in the structuring of a file into records,
each record containing a line of text.  A deck of punched cards has this
structure, for example.
<P>
Common Lisp provides an abstract interface by requiring that there be a single
character, <tt>#\Newline</tt>, that within the language serves as a line
delimiter.  (The language C has a similar requirement.)
An implementation of Common Lisp must translate between this internal
single-character representation and whatever external representation(s)
may be used.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> How the character called <tt>#\Newline</tt> is represented
internally is not specified here, but it is strongly suggested that
the ASCII LF character be used in Common Lisp implementations that use the
ASCII character encoding.  The ASCII CR character is a workable,
but in most cases inferior, alternative.

When the first edition was written it was not yet clear that UNIX would
become so widely accepted.  The decision to represent
the line delimiter as a single character has proved to be a good one.

<P>
The requirement that a line division be represented as a single character
has certain consequences.  A character string
written in the middle of a program in such a way as to span more than
one line must contain exactly one character to represent each line division.
Consider this code fragment:
<P><pre>
(setq a-string &quot;This string 
contains 
forty-two characters.&quot;)
</pre><P>
Between <tt>g</tt> and <tt>c</tt> there must be exactly one character,
<tt>#\Newline</tt>; a two-character sequence, such as <tt>#\Return</tt> and then
<tt>#\Newline</tt>, is not acceptable, nor is the absence of a character.
The same is true between <tt>s</tt> and <tt>f</tt>.
<P>
When the character <tt>#\Newline</tt> is written to an output file,
the Common Lisp implementation must take the appropriate action
to produce a line division.  This might involve writing out a
record or translating <tt>#\Newline</tt> to a CR/LF sequence.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> If an implementation uses the ASCII character encoding,
uses the CR/LF sequence externally to delimit lines,
uses LF to represent <tt>#\Newline</tt> internally, and supports <tt>#\Return</tt>
as a data object corresponding to the ASCII character CR, the
question arises as to what action to take when the program
writes out <tt>#\Return</tt> followed by <tt>#\Newline</tt>.
It should first be noted that <tt>#\Return</tt> is not a standard Common Lisp
character, and the action to be taken when <tt>#\Return</tt> is written out
is therefore not defined by the Common Lisp language.  A plausible approach
is to buffer the <tt>#\Return</tt> character and suppress it if and only if the
next character is <tt>#\Newline</tt> (the net effect is to generate a CR/LF
sequence).
Another plausible
approach is simply to ignore
the difficulty and declare that writing <tt>#\Return</tt> and then
<tt>#\Newline</tt> results in the sequence CR/CR/LF in the output.
