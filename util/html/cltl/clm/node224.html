<A NAME=COMPILERSECTION>The</A>
compiler is a program that may make code run faster by translating
programs into an implementation-dependent form that can
be executed more efficiently by the computer.  Most of the time
you can write programs without worrying about the compiler;
compiling a file of code should produce an equivalent but more
efficient program.  When doing more esoteric things, you may need to
think carefully about what happens at ``compile time'' and what happens
at ``load time.''  Then the difference between the syntaxes <tt>#.</tt>
and <tt>#,</tt> becomes important, and the <tt>eval-when</tt> construct
becomes particularly useful.

(SHARP-COMMA-CONFUSION) <A NAME=28273>&#160;</A>  to remove <tt>#,</tt> from the language.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>

Most declarations are not used by the Common Lisp interpreter;
they may be used to give advice to the compiler.  The compiler may attempt
to check your advice and warn you if it is inconsistent.
<P>
Unlike most other Lisp dialects, Common Lisp recognizes <tt>special</tt>
declarations in interpreted code as well as compiled code.
This potential source of incompatibility between interpreted and compiled
code is thereby <i>eliminated</i> in Common Lisp.
<P>
The internal workings of a compiler will of course be highly
implementation-dependent.  The following functions provide a standard
interface to the compiler, however.

<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>compile <i>name</i> &amp;optional <i>definition</i></tt><P>If <i>definition</i> is supplied, it should be a lambda-expression,
the interpreted function to be compiled.  If it is not supplied,
then <i>name</i> should be a symbol with a definition that is a
lambda-expression; that definition is compiled
and the resulting compiled code is put back into the symbol
as its function definition.

X3J13 voted in October 1988 (COMPILE-ARGUMENT-PROBLEMS) <A NAME=28285>&#160;</A> 
to restate the preceding paragraph more precisely and to extend the
capabilities of <tt>compile</tt>.
If the optional <i>definition</i> argument is supplied,
it may be either a lambda-expression (which is coerced to a function)
or a function to be compiled; if no <i>definition</i> is supplied,
the <tt>symbol-function</tt> of the symbol is extracted and compiled.
It is permissible for the symbol to have a macro definition rather than
a function definition; both macros and functions may be compiled.
<P>
It is an error if the function to be compiled was defined interpretively
in a non-null lexical environment.  (An implementation is free to extend
the behavior of <tt>compile</tt> to compile such functions properly, but
portable programs may not depend on this capability.)  The consequences
of calling <tt>compile</tt> on a function that is already compiled
are unspecified.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
The definition is compiled and a compiled-function object produced.
If <i>name</i> is a non-<tt>nil</tt>
symbol, then the compiled-function object is installed as the
global function definition of the symbol and the symbol is returned.
If <i>name</i> is <tt>nil</tt>, then the compiled-function object itself is returned.
For example:
<P><pre>

X3J13 voted in October 1988 (COMPILE-FILE-PACKAGE) <A NAME=28371>&#160;</A>  to specify that
<tt>compile-file</tt>, like <tt>load</tt>, rebinds <tt>*package*</tt> to its current value.  If
some form in the file changes the value of <tt>*package*</tt>,
the old value will be restored when compilation is completed.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (COMPILE-FILE-SYMBOL-HANDLING) <A NAME=28378>&#160;</A>  to specify
restrictions on conforming programs to ensure consistent handling of symbols
and packages.
<P>
  In order to guarantee that compiled files can be loaded correctly,
  the user must ensure that the packages referenced in the file are defined
  consistently at compile and load time.  Conforming Common Lisp programs
  must satisfy the following requirements.
<UL><LI> The value of <tt>*package*</tt> when a top-level form in the file is processed
      by <tt>compile-file</tt> must be the same as the value of <tt>*package*</tt> when the
      code corresponding to that top-level form in the compiled file is
      executed by the loader.  In particular,
      any top-level form in a file that alters the value of <tt>*package*</tt>
          must change it to a package of the same name at both compile and
          load time; moreover, if the first non-atomic top-level form
          in the file is not a call to
          <tt>in-package</tt>, then the value of <tt>*package*</tt> at the time <tt>load</tt> is
          called must be a package with the same name as the package that
          was the value of <tt>*package*</tt> at the time <tt>compile-file</tt> was called.
<P>
<LI> For every symbol appearing lexically within a top-level form that
      was accessible in the package that was the value of <tt>*package*</tt>
      during processing of that top-level form at compile time, but
      whose home package was another package, at load time there must
      be a symbol with the same name that is accessible in both the
      load-time <tt>*package*</tt> and in the package with the same name as the
      compile-time home package.
<P>
<LI> For every symbol in the compiled file that was an external symbol in
      its home package at compile time, there must be a symbol with the
      same name that is an external symbol in the package with the same name
      at load time.
</UL>
  If any of these conditions do not hold, the package in which <tt>load</tt> looks
  for the affected symbols is unspecified.  Implementations are permitted 
  to signal an error or otherwise define this behavior.
<P>
    These requirements are merely an explicit statement of the status quo,
    namely that users cannot depend on any particular behavior if the
    package environment at load time is inconsistent with what existed
    at compile time.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (IN-SYNTAX) <A NAME=28395>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>compile-file</tt> must bind <tt>*readtable*</tt> to its current value
at the time <tt>compile-file</tt> is called; the dynamic extent of the binding
should encompass all of the file-loading activity.
This allows a portable program to include forms such as
<P><pre>
(in-package &quot;FOO&quot;) 

(eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
  (setq *readtable* foo:my-readtable))
</pre><P>
without performing a net global side effect on the loading environment.
Such statements allow the remainder of such a file to be read either as
interpreted code or by <tt>compile-file</tt> in a syntax determined by
an alternative readtable.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (LOAD-TRUENAME) <A NAME=28404>&#160;</A> 
to require that <tt>compile-file</tt> bind two new variables
<tt>*compile-file-pathname*</tt> and <tt>*compile-file-truename*</tt>; the dynamic extent of the bindings
should encompass all of the file-compiling activity.

it is initially <tt>nil</tt> but <tt>compile-file</tt> binds it to a pathname that

<tt>*compile-file-truename*</tt><P>X3J13 voted in June 1989 (LOAD-TRUENAME) <A NAME=28447>&#160;</A>  to introduce <tt>*compile-file-truename*</tt>;
it is initially <tt>nil</tt> but <tt>compile-file</tt> binds it to the ``true name'' of
the pathname of the file being compiled.  See <tt>truename</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>load-time-value <i>form</i> [<i>read-only-p</i>]</tt><P>X3J13 voted in March 1989 (LOAD-TIME-EVAL) <A NAME=28456>&#160;</A>  to add
   a mechanism for delaying evaluation of a <i>form</i>
   until it can be done in the run-time environment.
<P>
   If a <tt>load-time-value</tt> expression is seen by <tt>compile-file</tt>, the compiler
   performs its normal semantic processing (such as macro expansion and
   translation into machine code) on the form, but arranges for the
   execution of the <i>form</i> to occur at load time in a null
   lexical environment, with the result of this evaluation then being
   treated as an immediate quantity (that is, as if originally quoted)
   at run time.  It is guaranteed that 
   the evaluation of the <i>form</i> will take place only once when the file is 
   loaded, but the order of evaluation with respect to the execution
   of top-level forms in the file is unspecified.
<P>
   If a <tt>load-time-value</tt> expression appears within a function compiled
   with <tt>compile</tt>, the <i>form</i> is evaluated at compile time in a null lexical
   environment.  The result of this compile-time evaluation is treated as 
   an immediate quantity in the compiled code.
<P>
   In interpreted code, <i>form</i> is evaluated (by <tt>eval</tt>) in a null
   lexical environment and one value is returned.  Implementations that
   implicitly compile (or partially compile) expressions passed to
   <tt>eval</tt> may evaluate the <i>form</i> only once, at the time this
   compilation is performed.  This is intentionally similar to the
   freedom that implementations are given for the time of expanding
   macros in interpreted code.
<P>
  If the same (as determined by <tt>eq</tt>) list <tt>(load-time-value <i>form</i>)</tt> is
  evaluated or compiled more than once, it is unspecified whether the <i>form</i>
  is evaluated only once or is evaluated more than once.  This can
  happen both when an expression being evaluated or compiled shares
  substructure and when the same expression is passed to <tt>eval</tt> or to
  <tt>compile</tt> multiple times.  Since a <tt>load-time-value</tt> expression may be
  referenced in more than one place and may be evaluated multiple times
  by the interpreter, it is unspecified whether each execution returns
  a ``fresh'' object or returns the same object as some other execution.
  Users must use caution when destructively modifying the resulting
  object.
<P>
  If two lists <tt>(load-time-value <i>form</i>)</tt> are <tt>equal</tt> but not <tt>eq</tt>, their
  values always come from distinct evaluations of <i>form</i>.  Coalescing
  of these forms is not permitted.
<P>
   The optional <i>read-only-p</i> argument designates whether the result
   may be considered a
   read-only constant. If <tt>nil</tt> (the default), the result must be considered
   ordinary, modifiable data. If <tt>t</tt>, the result is a read-only quantity
   that may, as appropriate, be copied into read-only space and may,
   as appropriate, be shared
   with other programs.  The <i>read-only-p</i> argument is
   not evaluated and only the literal symbols <tt>t</tt> and <tt>nil</tt> are permitted.
<P>
   This new feature addresses the same set of needs as the now-defunct
   <tt>#,</tt> reader syntax but in a cleaner and more general manner.
   Note that <tt>#,</tt> syntax was reliably useful only inside quoted structure
   (though this was not explicitly mentioned in the first edition),
   whereas a <tt>load-time-value</tt> form must appear outside quoted structure in a
   for-evaluation position.

<tt>function-lambda-expression <i>fn</i></tt><P>X3J13 voted in January 1989
(FUNCTION-DEFINITION) <A NAME=28513>&#160;</A> 
to add a new function to allow the
source code for a defined function to be recovered.
(The committee noted that the first edition provided no
portable way to recover a lambda-expression once it had
been compiled or evaluated to produce a function.)
<P>
This function takes one argument, which must be a function, and returns
three values.
<P>
The first value is the defining lambda-expression for the
function, or <tt>nil</tt> if that information is not available.
The lambda-expression may have been preprocessed in some ways
but should nevertheless be of a form suitable as an argument
to the function <tt>compile</tt> or for use in the <tt>function</tt> special form.
<P>
The second value is <tt>nil</tt> if the function was definitely
produced by closing
a lambda-expression in the null lexical environment; it is some
non-<tt>nil</tt> value if the function might have been closed in some
non-null lexical environment.
<P>
The third value is the ``name'' of the function; this is <tt>nil</tt> if the
name is not available or if the function had no name.
The name is intended for debugging purposes only and may be
any Lisp object (not necessarily one that would be valid for use as a name
in a <tt>defun</tt> or <tt>function</tt> special form, for example).
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> An implementation is always free to return the values
<tt>nil</tt>, <tt>t</tt>, <tt>nil</tt> from this function but is encouraged to
make more useful information available as appropriate.
For example, it may not be desirable for files of compiled code
to retain the source lambda-expressions for use after the file is loaded,
but it is probably desirable for
functions produced by ``in-core'' calls to <tt>eval</tt>,
<tt>compile</tt>, or <tt>defun</tt> to retain the defining lambda-expression
for debugging purposes.  The function <tt>function-lambda-expression</tt>
makes this information, if retained, accessible in a standard and portable
manner.

<tt>with-compilation-unit ({<i>option-name</i> <i>option-value</i>}*) {<i>form</i>}*</tt><P>X3J13 voted in March 1989 (WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT) <A NAME=28537>&#160;</A> 
to add <tt>with-compilation-unit</tt>, which
   executes the body forms as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>. Within the dynamic context
   of this form, warnings deferred by the compiler until ``the end of
   compilation'' will be deferred until the end of the outermost call
   to <tt>with-compilation-unit</tt>. The results are the same as those of
   the last of the forms (or <tt>nil</tt> if there is no <i>form</i>).
<P>
   Each <i>option-name</i> is an unevaluated keyword; each <i>option-value</i>
   is evaluated. The set of keywords permitted may be extended by the
   implementation, but the only standard option keyword is <tt>:override</tt>;
   the default value for this option is <tt>nil</tt>.
   If <tt>with-compilation-unit</tt> forms are nested dynamically, only the outermost
   such call has any effect unless the <tt>:override</tt> value of an
   inner call is true.
<P>
  The function <tt>compile-file</tt> should
  provide the effect of
  <P><pre>
  (with-compilation-unit (:override nil) ...)

  around its code.
<P>
  Any implementation-dependent extensions to this behavior may be provided only
  as the result of an explicit programmer request by use of 
  an implementation-dependent keyword.  It is forbidden for an implementation
  to attach additional meaning to a conforming use of this
  macro.
<P>
  Note that not all compiler warnings are deferred. In some implementations,
  it may be that none are deferred. This macro only creates an
  interface to the capability where it exists, it does not require the
  creation of the capability. An implementation that does not 
  defer any compiler warnings may correctly implement this macro
  as an expansion into a simple <tt>progn</tt>.
