The <tt>eval-when</tt> special form allows pieces of code to
be executed only at compile time, only at load time, or
when interpreted but not compiled.  Its uses are relatively esoteric.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>eval-when</tt> <tt>({<i>situation</I>}*)</tt> <tt>{<I>form</I>}*</tt><P>
The body of an <tt>eval-when</tt> form is processed as an implicit
<tt>progn</tt>, but only in the situations listed.  Each <i>situation</i>
must be a symbol, either <tt>compile</tt>, <tt>load</tt>, or <tt>eval</tt>.
<P>
<tt>eval</tt> specifies that the interpreter should process the body.
<tt>compile</tt> specifies that the compiler should evaluate the body
at compile time in the compilation context.
<tt>load</tt> specifies that the compiler should arrange to evaluate
the forms in the body when the compiled file containing the
<tt>eval-when</tt> form is loaded.
<P>
The <tt>eval-when</tt> construct may be more precisely understood in terms
of a model of how the compiler processes forms in a file to
be compiled.  Successive forms are read from the file using the
function <tt>read</tt>.
These top-level forms are normally processed in what we shall call
<i>not-compile-time</i> mode.  There is another mode called <i>compile-time-too</i>
mode.  The <tt>eval-when</tt> special form controls which of these two
modes to use.
<P>
Every form is processed as follows:
<UL><LI>
If the form is an <tt>eval-when</tt> form:<p>
<UL><LI>
If the situation <tt>load</tt> is specified:<p>
<UL><LI>
If the situation <tt>compile</tt> is specified, <i>or</i> if the
current processing mode is <i>compile-time-too</i> and the situation <tt>eval</tt>
is specified, then process each of the forms in the body
in <i>compile-time-too</i> mode.
<P>
<LI>
Otherwise, process each of the forms in the body in <i>not-compile-time</i> mode.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>
If the situation <tt>load</tt> is not specified:<p>
<UL><LI>
If the situation <tt>compile</tt> is specified, <i>or</i> if the
current processing mode is <i>compile-time-too</i> and the situation <tt>eval</tt>
is specified, then evaluate each of the forms in the body
in the compiler's executing environment.
<P>
<LI>
Otherwise, ignore the <tt>eval-when</tt> form entirely.
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<LI>
If the form is not an <tt>eval-when</tt> form, then do two things.
First, if the current processing mode is <i>compile-time-too</i> mode,
evaluate the form in the compiler's executing environment.
Second, perform normal compiler processing of the form
(compiling functions defined by <tt>defun</tt> forms, and so on).
</UL>
<P>
One example of the use of <tt>eval-when</tt> is that
if the compiler is to be able to properly read a file
that uses user-defined reader macro characters,
it is necessary to write
<P><pre>
(eval-when (compile load eval) 
  (set-macro-character #\$ #'(lambda (stream char) 
                               (declare (ignore char)) 
                               (list 'dollar (read stream)))))
</pre><P>
This causes the call to <tt>set-macro-character</tt> to be executed
in the compiler's execution environment, thereby modifying its
reader syntax table.

X3J13 voted in March 1989 (EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL) <A NAME=3719>&#160;</A>  to
completely redesign the <tt>eval-when</tt> construct to solve some problems
concerning its treatment in other than top-level contexts.
The new definition is upward compatible with the old definition,
but the old keywords are deprecated.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>eval-when</tt> <tt>({<i>situation</I>}*)</tt> <tt>{<I>form</I>}*</tt><P>
  The body of an <tt>eval-when</tt> form is processed as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>, but
  only in the situations listed.  Each <i>situation</i> must be a symbol,
  either <tt>:compile-toplevel</tt>,
  <tt>:load-toplevel</tt>, or <tt>:execute</tt>.
<P>
  The use of <tt>:compile-toplevel</tt> and <tt>:load-toplevel</tt>
  controls whether and when processing
  occurs for top-level forms. The use of <tt>:execute</tt> controls whether
  processing occurs for non-top-level forms.
<P>
  The <tt>eval-when</tt> construct may be more precisely understood in terms of
  a model of how the file compiler, <tt>compile-file</tt>, processes forms in a
  file to be compiled.
<P>
  Successive forms are read from the file by the file compiler using 
  <tt>read</tt>. These top-level forms are normally processed in what we call
  ``not-compile-time'' mode. There is one other mode, called 
  ``compile-time-too'' mode, which can come into play for top-level
  forms. The <tt>eval-when</tt> special form is used to annotate a program
  in a way that allows the program doing the processing to select
  the appropriate mode.
<P>
  Processing of top-level forms in the file compiler works as follows:
<P>
<UL>   <LI> If the form is a macro call, it is expanded and the result is
     processed as a top-level form in the same processing mode
     (compile-time-too or not-compile-time).
<P>
   <LI> If the form is a <tt>progn</tt> (or <tt>locally</tt> (LOCALLY-TOP-LEVEL) <A NAME=3740>&#160;</A> )
     form, each of its body forms is
     sequentially processed as top-level forms in the same processing
     mode.
<P>
   <LI> If the form is a <tt>compiler-let</tt>, <tt>macrolet</tt>,
     or <tt>symbol-macrolet</tt>,
     the file compiler makes the appropriate bindings and recursively
     processes the body forms as an implicit top-level <tt>progn</tt> with those 
     bindings in effect, in the same processing mode.
<P>
   <LI> If the form is an <tt>eval-when</tt> form, it is handled according to
     the following table:
          <P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_24769_tabular3747.gif"><P>
<P>
     In the preceding table the column LT asks whether <tt>:load-toplevel</tt>
     is one of the situations specified in the <tt>eval-when</tt> form;
     CT similarly refers to <tt>:compile-toplevel</tt> and EX to <tt>:execute</tt>.
     The column CTTM asks whether the <tt>eval-when</tt> form was encountered
     while in compile-time-too mode.  The phrase
     ``process body'' means to process the body as an implicit top-level
     <tt>progn</tt> in the indicated mode, and  ``evaluate body'' means to
     evaluate the body forms sequentially as an
     implicit <tt>progn</tt> in the dynamic execution context of the compiler and
     in the lexical environment in which the <tt>eval-when</tt> appears.
<P>
   <LI> Otherwise, the form is a top-level form that is not one of the
     special cases.  If in compile-time-too mode, the compiler first
     evaluates the form and then performs normal compiler processing
     on it.  If in not-compile-time mode, only normal compiler
     processing is performed (see section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).
     Any subforms are treated as non-top-level forms.
</UL>
<P>
  Note that top-level forms are guaranteed to be processed in the order
  in which they textually appear in the file, and that each top-level
  form read by the compiler is processed before the next is read.
  However, the order of processing (including, in particular, macro
  expansion) of subforms that are not top-level forms is unspecified.
<P>
  For an <tt>eval-when</tt> form that is not a top-level form in the file compiler
  (that is, either in the interpreter, in <tt>compile</tt>, or in the file
  compiler but not at top level), if the <tt>:execute</tt> situation is specified,
  its body is treated as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>.  Otherwise, the body
  is ignored and the <tt>eval-when</tt> form has the value <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
  For the sake of backward compatibility,
  a <i>situation</i> may also be <tt>compile</tt>, <tt>load</tt>, or <tt>eval</tt>.
  Within a top-level <tt>eval-when</tt> form
  these have the same meaning as <tt>:compile-toplevel</tt>, <tt>:load-toplevel</tt>,
  and <tt>:execute</tt>, respectively; but their effect is undefined when used
  in an <tt>eval-when</tt> form that is not at top level.
<P>
  The following effects are logical consequences of the preceding specification:
  <UL>   <LI> It is never the case that the execution of a single <tt>eval-when</tt>
     expression will execute the body code more than once.
<P>
   <LI> The old keyword <tt>eval</tt> was a misnomer because execution of
     the body need not be done by <tt>eval</tt>.  For example, when the
     function definition
     <P><pre>
     (defun foo () (eval-when (:execute) (print 'foo)))
     </pre><P>
     is compiled
     the call to <tt>print</tt> should be compiled, not evaluated at compile time.
<P>
   <LI> Macros intended for use in top-level forms should arrange for all
     side-effects to be done by the forms in the macro expansion.
     The macro-expander itself should not perform the side-effects.
<P><pre>
(defmacro foo () 
  (really-foo)                              ;Wrong
  `(really-foo)) 

(defmacro foo () 
  `(eval-when (:compile-toplevel 
               :load-toplevel :execute)     ;Right 
    (really-foo)))
</pre><P>
     Adherence to this convention will mean that such macros will behave
     intuitively when called in non-top-level positions.
<P>
   <LI> Placing a variable binding around an <tt>eval-when</tt>
     reliably captures the
     binding because the ``compile-time-too'' mode cannot occur (because 
     the <tt>eval-when</tt> could not be a top-level form).
     For example,
<P><pre>
(let ((x 3)) 
  (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) 
    (print x)))
</pre><P>
will print 3 at execution (that is, load) time
     and will not print anything at
     compile time.  This is important so that expansions of <tt>defun</tt> and 
     <tt>defmacro</tt> can be done in terms of <tt>eval-when</tt>
     and can correctly capture the lexical environment.
     For example, an implementation might expand a <tt>defun</tt> form such as
<P><pre>
(defun bar (x) (defun foo () (+ x 3)))
</pre><P>
into
<P><pre>
(progn (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) 
         (compiler::notice-function 'bar '(x))) 
       (eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute) 
         (setf (symbol-function 'bar) 
               #'(lambda (x) 
                   (progn (eval-when (:compile-toplevel)  
                            (compiler::notice-function 'foo 
                                                       '())) 
                          (eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute) 
                            (setf (symbol-function 'foo) 
                                  #'(lambda () (+ x 3)))))))))
</pre><P>
     which by the preceding rules would be treated the same as
<p><pre>
(progn (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) 
         (compiler::notice-function 'bar '(x))) 
       (eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute) 
         (setf (symbol-function 'bar) 
               #'(lambda (x) 
                   (progn (eval-when (:load-toplevel :execute) 
                            (setf (symbol-function 'foo) 
                                  #'(lambda () (+ x 3)))))))))
<P>
</CODE><P>
</UL>
<P>
Here are some additional examples.
<P><pre>
(let ((x 1)) 
  (eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
    (setf (symbol-function 'foo1) #'(lambda () x))))
<P>
</pre><P>
 The <tt>eval-when</tt> in the preceding expression is not at top level,
       so only the <tt>:execute</tt>
       keyword is considered.  At compile time, this has no effect.
       At load time (if the <tt>let</tt> is at top level), or at execution time
       (if the <tt>let</tt> is embedded in some other form which does not execute
       until later), this sets <tt>(symbol-function 'foo1)</tt> to a function that
       returns <tt>1</tt>.
<P><pre>
(eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
  (let ((x 2)) 
    (eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
      (setf (symbol-function 'foo2) #'(lambda () x)))))
</pre><P>
 If the preceding expression occurs at the top level of a file to be compiled,
       it has <i>both</i> a compile time <i>and</i> a load-time effect of setting
       <tt>(symbol-function 'foo2)</tt> to a function that returns <tt>2</tt>.
<P><pre>
(eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
  (setf (symbol-function 'foo3) #'(lambda () 3)))
</pre><P>
 If the preceding expression occurs at the top level of a file to be compiled,
       it has <i>both</i> a compile time <i>and</i>
       a load-time effect of setting the
       function cell of <tt>foo3</tt> to a function that returns <tt>3</tt>.
<P><pre>
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel) 
  (eval-when (:compile-toplevel)  
    (print 'foo4)))
</pre><P>
  The preceding expression always does nothing; it simply returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<P><pre>
(eval-when (:compile-toplevel)  
  (eval-when (:execute) 
    (print 'foo5)))
</pre><P>
  If the preceding form occurs at the top level of a file to be compiled,
       <tt>foo5</tt> is
       printed at compile time. If this form occurs in a non-top-level
       position, nothing is printed at compile time. Regardless of context,
       nothing is ever printed at load time or execution time.
<P>
<P><pre>
(eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel) 
  (eval-when (:compile-toplevel) 
    (print 'foo6)))
</pre><P>
<P>
    If the preceding form occurs at the top level of a file to be compiled,
       <tt>foo6</tt> is
       printed at compile time.  If this form occurs in a non-top-level
       position, nothing is printed at compile time. Regardless of context,
       nothing is ever printed at load time or execution time.
