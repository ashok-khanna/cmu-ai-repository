<P>
<A NAME=SPECIALIZEDTYPESPECIFIERSECTION>Some</A>
type specifier lists denote <i>specializations</i> of
data types named by symbols.  These specializations may be
reflected by more efficient representations in the underlying
implementation.  As an example, consider the type <tt>(array short-float)</tt>.
Implementation A may choose to provide a specialized representation
for arrays of short floating-point numbers, and implementation B
may choose not to.
<P>
If you should want to create an array for the
express purpose of holding only short-float objects, you may
optionally specify to <tt>make-array</tt> the element type
<tt>short-float</tt>.  This does not <i>require</i> <tt>make-array</tt> to create
an object of type <tt>(array short-float)</tt>; it merely <i>permits</i> it.  The
request is construed to mean ``Produce the most specialized array
representation capable of holding short-floats that the implementation
can provide.''  Implementation A will then produce a specialized
array of type <tt>(array short-float)</tt>, and implementation B
will produce an ordinary array of type <tt>(array t)</tt>.
<P>
If one were then to ask whether the array were actually of type
<tt>(array short-float)</tt>, implementation A would say ``yes,'' but
implementation B would say ``no.''  This is a property of <tt>make-array</tt>
and similar functions: what you ask for is not necessarily what you get.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
Types can therefore be used for two different purposes:
<i>declaration</i> and <i>discrimination</i>.  Declaring to <tt>make-array</tt>
that elements will always be of type <tt>short-float</tt> permits
optimization.  Similarly, declaring that a variable takes on
values of type <tt>(array short-float)</tt> amounts to saying that
the variable will take on values that might be produced by specifying
element type <tt>short-float</tt> to <tt>make-array</tt>.
On the other hand, if the predicate <tt>typep</tt> is used to test
whether an object is of type <tt>(array short-float)</tt>,
only objects actually of that specialized type can satisfy the test;
in implementation B no object can pass that test.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(ARRAY-TYPE-ELEMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=2237>&#160;</A> 
to eliminate the differing treatment of types
when used ``for discrimination'' rather than ``for declaration'' on the grounds
that implementors have not treated the distinction consistently
and (which is more important) users have found the distinction confusing.
<P>
As a consequence of this change, the behavior of <tt>typep</tt> and <tt>subtypep</tt>
on <tt>array</tt> and <tt>complex</tt> type specifiers must be modified.
See the descriptions of those functions.  In particular, under their new
behavior, implementation B would say ``yes,'' agreeing with implementation A,
in the discussion above.
<P>
Note that the distinction between declaration and discrimination remains
useful, if only so that we may remark that the specialized (list)
form of the
<tt>function</tt> type specifier may still be used only for declaration and
not for discrimination.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE) <A NAME=2245>&#160;</A>  to clarify that
while the specialized form of the <tt>function</tt> type specifier
(a list of the symbol <tt>function</tt> possibly followed by
argument and value type specifiers)
may be used only for declaration, the symbol form (simply the name
<tt>function</tt>) may be used for discrimination.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
The valid list-format names for data types are as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>(array <i>element-type</i> <i>dimensions</i>)</tt>
<DD>
This denotes the set
of specialized arrays
whose elements are all members of the type <i>element-type</i>
and whose dimensions match <i>dimensions</i>.
For declaration purposes, this type encompasses those arrays
that can result by specifying <i>element-type</i> as the element type
to the function <tt>make-array</tt>; this may be different
from what the type means for discrimination purposes.
<i>element-type</i> must be a valid type specifier or unspecified.
<i>dimensions</i> may be a non-negative integer, which is the number
of dimensions, or it may be a list of non-negative integers
representing the length of each dimension (any dimension
may be unspecified instead), or it may be unspecified.
For example:
<P><pre>
(array integer 3)           ;Three-dimensional arrays of integers 
(array integer (* * *))     ;Three-dimensional arrays of integers 
(array * (4 5 6))           ;4-by-5-by-6 arrays 
(array character (3 *))     ;Two-dimensional arrays of characters 
                            ; that have exactly three rows 
(array short-float <tt>()</tt>)      ;Zero-rank arrays of short-format 
                            ; floating-point numbers
</pre><P>
Note that <tt>(array t)</tt> is a proper subset of <tt>(array *)</tt>.
The reason is that <tt>(array t)</tt> is the set of arrays that can
hold any Common Lisp object (the elements are of type <tt>t</tt>,
which includes all objects).  On the other hand, <tt>(array *)</tt>
is the set of all arrays whatsoever, including, for example,
arrays that can hold only characters.  Now
<tt>(array character)</tt> is not a subset of <tt>(array t)</tt>; the two sets
are in fact disjoint because <tt>(array character)</tt> is not the
set of all arrays that can hold characters but rather the set of
arrays that are specialized to hold precisely characters and no
other objects.  To test whether an array <tt>foo</tt> can hold a character,
one should not use
<P><pre>
(typep foo '(array character))
</pre><P>
but rather
<P><pre>
(subtypep 'character (array-element-type foo))
</pre><P>
See <tt>array-element-type</tt>.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(ARRAY-TYPE-ELEMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=2284>&#160;</A> 
to change <tt>typep</tt> and <tt>subtypep</tt>
so that the specialized <tt>array</tt> type specifier
means the same thing for discrimination
as for declaration: it encompasses those arrays
that can result by specifying <i>element-type</i> as the element type
to the function <tt>make-array</tt>.
Under this interpretation <tt>(array character)</tt> might be
the same type as <tt>(array t)</tt>
(although it also might not be the same).
See <tt>upgraded-array-element-type</tt>.
However,
<P><pre>
(typep foo '(array character))
</pre><P>
is still not a legitimate test of whether the array
<tt>foo</tt> can hold a character; one must still say
<P><pre>
(subtypep 'character (array-element-type foo))
</pre><P>
to determine that question.
<P>
X3J13 also voted in January 1989
(DECLARE-ARRAY-TYPE-ELEMENT-REFERENCES) <A NAME=2298>&#160;</A> 
to specify that within the lexical scope of an array type declaration,
it is an error for an array element, when referenced, not to be
of the exact declared element type.  A compiler may, for example,
treat every reference to an element of a declared array as if
the reference were surrounded by a <tt>the</tt> form mentioning the
declared array element type (<i>not</i> the upgraded array element type).  Thus
<P><pre>
(defun snarf-hex-digits (the-array) 
  (declare (type (array (unsigned-byte 4) 1) the-array)) 
  (do ((j (- (length array) 1) (- j 1)) 
       (val 0 (logior (ash val 4) 
                      (aref the-array j)))) 
      ((&lt; j 0) val)))
</pre><P>
may be treated as
<P><PRE>
(defun snarf-hex-digits (the-array) 
  (declare (type (array (unsigned-byte 4) 1) the-array)) 
  (do ((j (- (length array) 1) (- j 1)) 
       (val 0 (logior (ash val 4) 
                      (the (unsigned-byte 4) 
                           (aref the-array j))))) 
      ((&lt; j 0) val)))
</PRE><P>
The declaration amounts to a promise by the user that the <tt>aref</tt>
will never produce a value outside the interval 0 to 15, even if
in that particular implementation the array element type
<tt>(unsigned-byte 4)</tt> is upgraded to, say, <tt>(unsigned-byte 8)</tt>.
If such upgrading does occur, then values outside that range may in fact
be stored in <tt>the-array</tt>, as long as the code in <tt>snarf-hex-digits</tt>
never sees them.
<P>
As a general rule, a compiler would be justified in transforming
<P><PRE>
(aref (the (array <i>elt-type</i> ...) <i>a</i>) ...)
</PRE><P>
into
<P><PRE>
(the <i>elt-type</i> (aref (the (array <i>elt-type</i> ...) <i>a</i>) ...)
</PRE><P>
It may also make inferences involving more complex functions,
such as <tt>position</tt> or <tt>find</tt>.
For example, <tt>find</tt> applied to an array always returns either <tt>nil</tt>
or an object whose type is the element type of the array.

Every element of this type is a

from what the type means for discrimination purposes.

(FUNCTION-TYPE-REST-LIST-ELEMENT) <A NAME=2384>&#160;</A> 
to specify that the <i>arg-type</i> that
follows a <tt>&amp;rest</tt> marker indicates the type of each actual argument
that would be gathered into the list for a <tt>&amp;rest</tt> parameter,
and not the type of the <tt>&amp;rest</tt> parameter itself (which is always
<tt>list</tt>).  Thus one might declare the function <tt>gcd</tt> to
be of type <tt>(function (&amp;rest integer) integer)</tt>, or
the function <tt>aref</tt> to be of type
<tt>(function (array &amp;rest fixnum) t)</tt>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE-KEY-NAME) <A NAME=2396>&#160;</A> 
to specify that, in a <tt>function</tt> type specifier,
an argument type specifier following <tt>&amp;key</tt>
must be a list of two items, a keyword and a type specifier.
The keyword must be a valid keyword-name symbol that may be
supplied in the actual arguments of a call to the function,
and the type specifier indicates the permitted type of
the corresponding argument value.  (The keyword-name symbol
is typically a keyword,
but another X3J13 vote (KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-NAME-PACKAGE) <A NAME=2399>&#160;</A> 
allows it to be any symbol.)
Furthermore, if <tt>&amp;allow-other-keys</tt> is not present,
the set of keyword-names mentioned in the <tt>function</tt>
type specifier may be assumed to be exhaustive;
for example, a compiler would be justified in issuing
a warning for a function call using a keyword argument name
not mentioned in the type declaration for the function being called.
If <tt>&amp;allow-other-keys</tt>
is present in the <tt>function</tt>
type specifier, other keyword arguments may be supplied
when calling a function of the indicated type, and if supplied such
arguments may possibly be used.

As an example, the function <tt>cons</tt> is of type <tt>(function (t t) cons)</tt>,
because it can accept any two arguments and always returns a cons.
The function <tt>cons</tt> is
also of type <tt>(function (float string) list)</tt>, because it can certainly
accept a floating-point number and a string (among other things), and its
result is always of type <tt>list</tt> (in fact a <tt>cons</tt> is never <tt>null</tt>,
but that does not matter for this type declaration).

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(FUNCTION-TYPE-ARGUMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=2418>&#160;</A> 
to alter the meaning of the
<tt>function</tt> type specifier when used in <tt>type</tt> and <tt>ftype</tt>
declarations.  While the preceding formulation may be theoretically
elegant, they have found that it is not useful to compiler implementors
and that it is not the interpretation that users expect.  X3J13 prescribed instead the
following interpretation of declarations.
<P>
A declaration specifier of the form
<P><PRE>
(ftype (function (<i>arg1-type</i> <i>arg2-type</i> ... <i>argn-type</i>) <i>value-type</i>) <i>fname</i>)
</PRE><P>
implies that any function call of the form
<P><PRE>
(<i>fname</i> <i>arg1</i> <i>arg2</i> ...)
</PRE><P>
within the scope of the declaration can be treated as if it were
rewritten to use <tt>the</tt>-forms in the following manner:
<P><PRE>
(the <i>value-type</i> 
     (<i>fname</i> (the <i>arg1-type</i> <i>arg1</i>) 
            (the <i>arg2-type</i> <i>arg2</i>) 
            ... 
            (the <i>argn-type</i> <i>argn</i>)))
</PRE><P>
That is, it is an error for any of the actual arguments not to be of
its specified type <i>arg-type</i> or for the result not to be of the specified
type <i>value-type</i>.  (In particular, if any argument is not of
its specified type, then the result is not guaranteed to be of the
specified type-if indeed a result is returned at all.)
<P>
Similarly, a declaration specifier of the form
<P><PRE>
(type (function (<i>arg1-type</i> <i>arg2-type</i> ... <i>argn-type</i>) <i>value-type</i>) <i>var</i>)
</PRE><P>
is interpreted to mean that any reference to the variable <i>var</i>
will find that its value is a function, and that
it is an error to call this function with any actual argument not of
its specified type <i>arg-type</i>.
Also, it is an error for the result not to be of the specified
type <i>value-type</i>.
For example, a function call of the form
<P><PRE>
(funcall <i>var</i> <i>arg1</i> <i>arg2</i> ...)
</PRE><P>
could be rewritten to use <tt>the</tt>-forms as well.
If any argument is not of
its specified type, then the result is not guaranteed to be of the
specified type-if indeed a result is returned at all.
<P>
Thus, a <tt>type</tt> or <tt>ftype</tt> declaration specifier describes type
requirements imposed on calls to a function
as opposed to requirements imposed on the definition of the function.
This is analogous to the treatment of type declarations of variables
as imposing type requirements on references to variables, rather than
on the contents of variables.  See the vote of X3J13 on <tt>type</tt>
declaration specifiers in general, discussed
in section <A HREF="node105.html#DECLARATIONSPECIFIERSSECTION">9.2</A>.
<P>
In the same manner as for variable type declarations in general,
if two or more
of these declarations apply to the same function call (which can
occur if declaration scopes are suitably nested), then they all apply;
in effect, the types for each argument or result are intersected.
For example, the code fragment
<P><PRE>
(locally (declare (ftype (function (biped) digit) 
                         butcher-fudge)) 
  (locally (declare (ftype (function (featherless) opposable) 
                           butcher-fudge)) 
    (butcher-fudge sam)))
</PRE><P>
may be regarded as equivalent to
<P><PRE>
(the opposable 
     (the digit (butcher-fudge (the featherless 
                                    (the biped sam)))))
</PRE><P>
or to
<P><PRE>
(the (and opposable digit) 
     (butcher-fudge (the (and featherless biped) sam)))
</PRE><P>
That is, <tt>sam</tt> had better be both <tt>featherless</tt> and a <tt>biped</tt>,
and the result of <tt>butcher-fudge</tt> had better be both
<tt>opposable</tt> and a <tt>digit</tt>; otherwise the code is in error.
Therefore a compiler may generate code that relies on these type assumptions,
for example.

<DT><tt>(values <i>value1-type</i> <i>value2-type</i> ...)</tt>

This type specifier is extremely restricted: it may be used <i>only</i>
as the <i>value-type</i> in a <tt>function</tt> type specifier or in
a <tt>the</tt> special form.  It is used to specify individual types when
multiple values are involved.
The
<tt>&amp;optional</tt>, <tt>&amp;rest</tt>, and <tt>&amp;key</tt> markers may appear in the <i>value-type</i> list;
they thereby indicate the parameter list of a
function that, when given to <tt>multiple-value-call</tt> along with
the values, would be suitable for receiving those values.
