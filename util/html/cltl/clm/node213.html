<P>
  Large programs can be moved between sites without changing any
  pathnames, provided all pathnames used are logical.  A portable system
  construction tool can be created that operates on programs defined as
  sets of files named by logical pathnames.
<P>
   Logical pathname syntax was chosen to be easily translated into the formats of most
  popular file systems, while still being powerful enough for storing large
  programs.  Although they have hierarchical directories, extended wildcard
  matching, versions, and no limit on the length of names, logical pathnames can be
  mapped onto a less capable real file system by translating each
  directory that is used into a flat directory name, processing wildcards in
  the Lisp implementation rather than in the file system, treating all versions as <tt>:newest</tt>,
  and using translations to shorten long names.
<P>
  Logical pathname words are restricted to non-case-sensitive letters,
  digits, and hyphens to avoid creating problems with real file systems
  that support limited character sets for file naming.
  (If logical pathnames were
  case-sensitive, it would be very difficult to map them into a
  file system that is not sensitive to case in its file names.)
<P>
  It is not a goal of logical pathnames to be able to represent all
  possible file names.  Their goal is rather to represent just enough file
  names to be useful for storing software.  Real pathnames, in contrast,
  need to provide a uniform interface to all possible file names, including
  names and naming conventions that are not under the control of Common
  Lisp.
<P>
  The choice of logical pathname syntax, using colon, semicolon, and
  period, was guided by the goals of being visually distinct from real file
  systems and minimizing the use of special characters.
<P>
  The <tt>logical-pathname</tt> function is separate from the <tt>pathname</tt> function
  so that the syntax of logical pathname namestrings does not constrain the
  syntax of physical pathname namestrings in any way.  Logical pathname
  syntax must be defined by Common Lisp so that logical pathnames can be
  conveniently exchanged between implementations, but physical pathname
  syntax is dictated by the operating environments.
<P>
The <tt>compile-file-pathname</tt> function and the specification of <tt>LISP</tt>
  as the type of a logical pathname for a Common Lisp source file together
  provide enough information about compilation to make possible a portable system
  construction tool.  Suppose that it is desirable
  to call <tt>compile-file</tt> only if the source file is newer than the compiled
  file.  For this to succeed, it must be possible to know the name of the
  compiled file without actually calling <tt>compile-file</tt>.
  In some implementations the compiler produces one of several file types,
  depending on a variety of implementation-dependent circumstances,
  so it is not sufficient simply to prescribe a standard logical file type
  for compiled files;
  <tt>compile-file-pathname</tt> provides access to the defaulting that is performed
  by <tt>compile-file</tt> ``in a manner
  appropriate to the implementation's file system conventions.''
<P>
The use of the logical pathname host name <tt>SYS</tt> for the implementation
  is current practice.  Standardizing on this name helps users choose
  logical pathname host names that avoid conflicting with
  implementation-defined names.
<P>
Loading of logical pathname translations from a site-dependent file
  allows software to be distributed using logical pathnames.  The assumed
  model of software distribution is a division of labor between the
  supplier of the software and the user installing it.  The supplier
  chooses logical pathnames to name all the files used or created by the
  software, and supplies examples of logical pathname translations for a
  few popular file systems.  Each example uses an assumed directory and/or
  device name, assumes local file naming conventions, and provides
  translations that will translate all the logical pathnames used or
  generated by the particular software into valid physical pathnames.
  For a powerful file system these translations can be quite simple.  For
  a more restricted file system, it may be necessary to list an explicit
  translation for every logical pathname used (for example, when dealing
  with restrictions on the maximum length of a file name).
<P>
The user installing the software decides on which device and directory
  to store the files and edits the example logical pathname translations
  accordingly.  If necessary, the user also adjusts the translations for
  local file naming conventions and any other special aspects of the user's
  local file system policy and local Common Lisp implementation.  For
  example, the files might be divided among several file server hosts to
  share the load.  The process of defining site-customized logical pathname
  translations is quite easy for a user of a popular file system for which
  the software supplier has provided an example.  A user of a more unusual
  file system might have to take more time; the supplier can help by
  providing a list of all the logical pathnames used or generated by the
  software.Once the user has created and executed
  a suitable <tt>setf</tt> form for setting the <tt>logical-pathname-translations</tt>
  of the relevant logical host, the software can be loaded and run.  It
  may be necessary to use the translations again, or on another workstation
  at the same site, so it is best to save the <tt>setf</tt> form in the standard
  place where it can be found later by <tt>load-logical-pathname-translations</tt>.
  Often a software supplier will include a program for restoring software
  from the distribution medium to the file system and a program for loading
  the software from the file system into a Common Lisp; these programs
  will start by calling <tt>load-logical-pathname-translations</tt> to make sure that
  the logical pathname host is defined.
<P>
  Note that the <tt>setf</tt> of <tt>logical-pathname-translations</tt> form isn't part of
  the program; it is separate and is written by the user, not by the
  software supplier.  That separation and a uniform convention for
  doing the separation are the key aspects of logical pathnames.  For small
  programs involving only a handful of files, it doesn't matter much.  The
  real benefits come with large programs with hundreds or thousands of
  files and more complicated situations such as program-generated file
  names or porting a program developed on a system with long file names
  onto a system with a very restrictive limit on the length of file names.
