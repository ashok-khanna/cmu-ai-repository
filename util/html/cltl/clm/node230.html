<P>
The utilities described in this section are sufficiently complex
and sufficiently dependent on the host environment that their
complete definition is beyond the scope of this book.
However, they are also sufficiently
useful to warrant mention here.  It is expected that
every implementation will
provide some version of these utilities, however clever or however simple.

<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
Invoking <tt>trace</tt> with one or more function-names (symbols) causes
the functions named to be traced.  Henceforth, whenever such
a function is invoked, information about the call, the arguments
passed, and the eventually returned values, if any, will be printed
to the stream that is the value of <tt>*trace-output*</tt>.

If a function call is open-coded (possibly as a result of an <tt>inline</tt>

Invoking <tt>untrace</tt> with one or more function names will cause those

an implementation may step through only those parts of the

 or <tt>t</tt> (meaning <tt>*terminal-io*</tt>).
<P>
The behavior of <tt>describe</tt> depends on the generic function
<tt>describe-object</tt> (see below).
<P>
X3J13 voted in January 1989
(DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE) <A NAME=28976>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>describe</tt> is forbidden
to prompt for or require user input when given exactly one argument;
it also voted to permit implementations
to extend <tt>describe</tt> to accept keyword arguments that may cause
it to prompt for or to require user input.
<P>
<BR><b>[Generic function]</b><BR>
<tt>describe-object <i>object</i> <i>stream</i> </tt>
<BR><b>[Primary method]</b><BR>
<tt>describe-object (<i>object</i> <i>standard-object</i>) <i>stream</i> </tt>
<P>X3J13 voted in March 1989 (DESCRIBE-UNDERSPECIFIED) <A NAME=28982>&#160;</A>  to add
  the generic function <tt>describe-object</tt>, which writes a description of an object to a
  stream.  The function <tt>describe-object</tt> is called by the <tt>describe</tt> function; it
  should not be called by the user.
<P>
  Each implementation must provide a method on the class
  <tt>standard-object</tt> and methods on enough other classes to ensure that
  there is always an applicable method.  Implementations are free to add
  methods for other classes.  Users can write methods for <tt>describe-object</tt> for
  their own classes if they do not wish to inherit an implementation-supplied
  method.
<P>
   The first argument may be any Lisp object.  The second argument is a stream; it
   cannot be <tt>t</tt> or <tt>nil</tt>.
   The values returned by <tt>describe-object</tt> are unspecified.
<P>
   Methods on <tt>describe-object</tt> may recursively call <tt>describe</tt>.  Indentation,
   depth limits, and circularity detection are all taken care of automatically,
   provided that each method handles exactly one level of structure and calls
   <tt>describe</tt> recursively if there are more structural levels.
   If this rule is not obeyed, the results are undefined.
<P>
   In some implementations the <i>stream</i> argument passed to a <tt>describe-object</tt>
   method is not the original stream but is an intermediate stream that
   implements parts of <tt>describe</tt>.  Methods should therefore not depend on the
   identity of this stream.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Rationale:</b> This proposal was closely modeled on the CLOS description of <tt>print-object</tt>,
 which was well thought out and provides a great deal of functionality and
 implementation freedom.  Implementation techniques for
 <tt>print-object</tt> are applicable to <tt>describe-object</tt>.
<P>
 The reason for making the return values for <tt>describe-object</tt> unspecified is to
 avoid forcing users to write <tt>(values)</tt> explicitly in all their methods;
 <tt>describe</tt> should take care of that.

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-LOGICAL) <A NAME=29061>&#160;</A>  to require <tt>dribble</tt>

<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1988
(DRIBBLE-TECHNIQUE) <A NAME=29066>&#160;</A> 
to clarify that <tt>dribble</tt> is intended primarily
for interactive debugging and that its effect cannot be
relied upon for use in portable
programs.
<P>
Different implementations of Common Lisp have used radically different
techniques for implementing <tt>dribble</tt>.  All are reasonable interpretations
of the original specification, and all behave in approximately the same
way if <tt>dribble</tt> is called only from the interactive top level.
However, they may have quite different behaviors if <tt>dribble</tt> is
called from within compound forms.
<P>
Consider two models of the operation of <tt>dribble</tt>.  In the ``redirecting''
model, a call to <tt>dribble</tt> with a pathname argument
alters certain global variables such as <tt>*standard-output*</tt>,
perhaps by constructing a broadcast stream directed to both the original
value of <tt>*standard-output*</tt> and to the dribble file; other streams
may be affected as well.  A call to <tt>dribble</tt> with no arguments
undoes these side effects.
<P>
In the ``recursive'' model, by contrast, a call to <tt>dribble</tt> with a
pathname argument creates a new interactive command loop and calls it
recursively.  This new command loop is just like an ordinary
read-eval-print loop except that it also echoes the interaction to
the dribble file.  A call to <tt>dribble</tt> with no arguments
does a <tt>throw</tt> that exits the recursive command loop and returns
to the original caller of <tt>dribble</tt> with an argument.
<P>
The two models may be distinguished by this test case:
<P><pre>
(progn (dribble &quot;basketball&quot;) 
       (print &quot;Larry&quot;) 
       (dribble) 
       (princ &quot;Bird&quot;))
</pre><P>
If this form is input to the Lisp top level, in either model
a newline (provided by the function <tt>print</tt>) and the words
<tt>Larry Bird</tt> will be printed to the standard output.
The redirecting dribble model will additionally print all but the word
<tt>Bird</tt> to a file named <tt>basketball</tt>.
<P>
By contrast, the recursive dribble model will enter a recursive command
loop and not print anything until <tt>(dribble)</tt> is executed from within
the new interactive command loop.  At that time the file named
<tt>basketball</tt> will be closed, and then execution of the
<tt>progn</tt> form will be resumed.  A newline and ``<tt>Larry </tt>'' (note the trailing space)
will be printed to the standard output, and then the call
<tt>(dribble)</tt> may complain that there is no active dribble file.
Once this error is resolved, the word <tt>Bird</tt> may be printed
to the standard output.
<P>
Here is a slightly different test case:
<P><pre>
(dribble &quot;baby-food&quot;)
</pre><P>
<P><pre>
(progn (print &quot;Mashed banana&quot;) 
       (dribble) 
       (princ &quot;and cream of rice&quot;))
</pre><P>
If this form is input to the Lisp top level, in the redirecting model
a newline and the words
<tt>Mashed banana and cream of rice</tt> will be printed to the standard output
and all but the words
<tt>and cream of rice</tt> will be sent to a file named <tt>baby-food</tt>.
<P>
The recursive model will direct exactly the same output to the file
named <tt>baby-food</tt> but will never print the words
<tt>and cream of rice</tt> to the standard output because the call
<tt>(dribble)</tt> does not return normally; it throws.
<P>
The redirecting model may be intuitively more appealing to some.
The recursive model, however, may be more robust; it carefully limits
the extent of the dribble operation and disables dribbling if a
throw of any kind occurs.  The vote by X3J13 was an explicit decision
not to decide which model to use.  Users are advised to call <tt>dribble</tt>
only interactively, at top level.

Whenever <tt>apropos</tt> finds a symbol, it prints
out the symbol's name; in addition,
information about the function definition and dynamic value of the symbol,
if any, is printed.
If <i>package</i> is specified and not <tt>nil</tt>, then only symbols
available in that package are examined;
otherwise ``all'' packages are searched, as if by <tt>do-all-symbols</tt>.
Because a symbol may be available by way of more than one inheritance
path, <tt>apropos</tt> may print information about the same symbol more than once.
The information is printed to the stream that is the value
of <tt>*standard-output*</tt>.
<tt>apropos</tt> returns no values (that is, it returns what the expression
<tt>(values)</tt> returns: zero values).
