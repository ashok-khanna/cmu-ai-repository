<P>
The <tt>macroexpand</tt> function is the conventional means for
expanding a macro call.  A hook is provided for a user function
to gain control during the expansion process.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>macroexpand</tt> <tt><i>form</i></tt> <tt>&amp;optional</tt> <tt><i>env</i></tt> <tt><BR></tt><tt>macroexpand-1</tt> <tt><i>form</i></tt> <tt>&amp;optional</tt> <tt><i>env</i></tt><P>If <i>form</i> is a macro call, then <tt>macroexpand-1</tt> will expand the macro
call <i>once</i> and return two values: the expansion and <tt>t</tt>.
If <i>form</i> is not a macro call, then the two values <i>form</i> and <tt>nil</tt> are
returned.
<P>
A <i>form</i> is considered to be a macro call only if it is a cons whose
<i>car</i> is a symbol that names a macro.  The environment <i>env</i> is similar
to that used within the evaluator (see <tt>evalhook</tt>);
it defaults to a null environment.
Any local macro definitions established within <i>env</i> by
<tt>macrolet</tt> will be considered.  If only <i>form</i> is given as an
argument, then the environment is effectively null,
and only global macro definitions
(as established by <tt>defmacro</tt>) will be considered.
<P>
Macro expansion is carried out as follows.  Once <tt>macroexpand-1</tt> has
determined that a symbol names a macro, it obtains the expansion
function for that macro.  The value of the variable
<tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> is then called as a function of three arguments:
the expansion function, the <i>form</i>, and the environment <i>env</i>.
The value returned from
this call is taken to be the expansion of the macro call.
The initial value of <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> is <tt>funcall</tt>,
and the net effect is to invoke the expansion function, giving
it <i>form</i> and <i>env</i> as its two arguments.

X3J13 voted in June 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE) <A NAME=8549>&#160;</A>  to specify
that the value of <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> is first coerced to a
function before being called as the expansion interface hook.
Therefore its value may be a symbol, a lambda-expression, or any
object of type <tt>function</tt>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-EXTENT) <A NAME=8554>&#160;</A> 
to specify that macro environment objects received
by a <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> function
have only dynamic extent.  The consequences are undefined if such objects are
referred to outside the dynamic extent of that particular invocation of the hook
function.  This allows implementations to use somewhat more efficient techniques
for representing environment objects.

(The purpose of
<tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> is to facilitate various techniques
for improving interpretation speed by caching macro expansions.)

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MACRO-CACHING) <A NAME=8561>&#160;</A>  to clarify that, while
<tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> may be useful for debugging purposes, despite
the original design intent there is
currently no correct portable way to use it for caching macro expansions.
<UL><LI>
 Caching by displacement (performing a side effect on the
 macro-call form) won't work because the same (<tt>eq</tt>) macro-call
 form may appear in distinct lexical contexts.  In addition, the macro-call
 form may be a read-only constant (see <tt>quote</tt> and also
 section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).<p>
<LI>
 Caching by table lookup won't work because such a table would have to
 be keyed by both the macro-call form and the environment,
 but X3J13 voted in March 1989 (MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-EXTENT) <A NAME=8567>&#160;</A> 
 to permit macro environments to have only dynamic extent.<p>
<LI>
 Caching by storing macro-call forms and expansions within the
 environment object itself would work, but there are no portable
 primitives that would allow users to do this.
</UL>
X3J13 also noted that, although there seems to be no correct portable way to use
<tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> to cache macro expansions, there is no
requirement that an implementation call the macro expansion
function more than once for a given form and lexical environment.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989
(SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=8572>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>macroexpand-1</tt> will also expand symbol macros
defined by <tt>symbol-macrolet</tt>; therefore a <i>form</i> may also be
a macro call if it is a symbol.  The vote did not address the interaction
of this feature with the <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> function.  An obvious
implementation choice is that the hook function is indeed called
and given a special expansion function that, when applied to the
<i>form</i> (a symbol) and <i>env</i>, will produce the expansion,
just as for an ordinary macro; but this is only my suggestion.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
The evaluator expands macro calls as if through the use of <tt>macroexpand-1</tt>;
the point is that <tt>eval</tt> also uses <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt>.
<P>
<tt>macroexpand</tt> is similar to <tt>macroexpand-1</tt>,
but repeatedly expands <i>form</i> until it is no longer a macro call.
(In effect, <tt>macroexpand</tt> simply calls <tt>macroexpand-1</tt> repeatedly
until the second value returned is <tt>nil</tt>.)
A second value of <tt>t</tt> or <tt>nil</tt> is returned as for <tt>macroexpand-1</tt>,
indicating whether the original <i>form</i> was a macro call.
