<P>
<A NAME=PATHNAME>All</A>
file systems dealt with by Common Lisp are forced into a common framework,
in which files are named by a Lisp data object of type <tt>pathname</tt>.
<P>
A pathname always has six components, described below.  These components
are the common interface that allows programs to work the same way with
different file systems; the mapping of the pathname components into the
concepts peculiar to each file system is taken care of by the Common Lisp
implementation.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><i>host</i>
<DD>
The name of the file system on which the file resides.
<P>
<DT><i>device</i>
<DD>
Corresponds to the ``device'' or ``file structure'' concept in many
host file systems: the name of a (logical or physical) device containing files.
<P>
<DT><i>directory</i>
<DD>
Corresponds to the ``directory'' concept in many host file systems:
the name of a group of related files
(typically those belonging to a single
user or project).
<P>
<DT><i>name</i>
<DD>
The name of a group of files that can be thought of as
the ``same'' file.
<P>
<DT><i>type</i>
<DD>
Corresponds to the ``filetype'' or ``extension'' concept in many host
file systems; identifies the type of file.  Files with the same names
but different types are usually related in some specific way, for instance,
one being a source file, another the compiled form of that source,
and a third the listing of error messages from the compiler.
<P>
<DT><i>version</i>
<DD>
Corresponds to the ``version number'' concept in many host file systems.
Typically this is a number that is incremented every time the file is modified.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Note that a pathname is not necessarily the name of a specific file.
Rather, it is a specification (possibly only a partial specification) of
how to access a file.  A pathname need not correspond to any file that
actually exists, and more than one pathname can refer to the same file.
For example, the pathname with a version of ``newest'' may refer to the
same file as a pathname with the same components except a certain number
as the version.  Indeed, a pathname with version ``newest'' may refer to
different files as time passes, because the meaning of such a pathname
depends on the state of the file system.  In file systems with such
facilities as ``links,'' multiple file names, logical devices, and so on,
two pathnames that look quite different may turn out to address the same
file.  To access a file given a pathname, one must do a file system
operation such as
<tt>open</tt>.
<P>
Two important operations involving pathnames are <i>parsing</i> and
<i>merging</i>.  Parsing is the conversion of a namestring (which might be
something supplied interactively by the user when asked to supply the
name of a file) into a pathname object.  This operation is
implementation-dependent, because the format of namestrings
is implementation-dependent.
Merging takes a pathname with missing components
and supplies values for those components from a source of defaults.
<P>
Not all of the components of a pathname need to be specified.  If a
component of a pathname is missing, its value is <tt>nil</tt>.  Before the file
system interface can do anything interesting with a file, such as opening the
file, all the missing components of a pathname must be filled in
(typically from a set of defaults).  Pathnames with missing components
may be used internally for various purposes;
in particular, parsing a namestring
that does not specify certain components will result in a pathname with
missing components.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in January 1989 (PATHNAME-UNSPECIFIC-COMPONENT) <A NAME=26052>&#160;</A> 
to permit any component of a pathname to have the value <tt>:unspecific</tt>,
meaning that the component simply does not exist,
for file systems in which such a value makes sense.
(For example, a UNIX file system usually does not support version numbers,
so the version component of a pathname for a UNIX host might be
<tt>:unspecific</tt>.  Similarly,
the file type is usually regarded in a UNIX file system as the part
of a name after a period, but some file names contain no periods and therefore have
no file types.)
<P>
  When a pathname is converted to a namestring, the values <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>:unspecific</tt>
  have the same effect: they
  are treated as if the component were empty (that is, they each cause the
  component not to appear in the namestring).
  When merging, however, only a <tt>nil</tt> value for a component will be
  replaced with the default for that component; the value <tt>:unspecific</tt>
  will be left alone as if the field were filled.
<P>
  The results are undefined if <tt>:unspecific</tt> is supplied
  to a file system in a component for which
  <tt>:unspecific</tt> does not make sense for that file system.
<P>
  Programming hint:
  portable programs should be prepared to handle the value <tt>:unspecific</tt> in the device,
  directory, type, or version field in some implementations.
  Portable programs should not explicitly place <tt>:unspecific</tt> in any
  field because it might not be permitted in some situations,
  but portable programs may sometimes do so implicitly (by copying
  such a value from another pathname, for example).

<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
A component of a pathname can also be the keyword <tt>:wild</tt>.
This is only useful when the pathname is being used with a
directory-manipulating operation, where it means that the pathname
component matches anything.  The printed representation of a pathname
typically designates <tt>:wild</tt> by an asterisk; however, this is
host-dependent.
<br><img align=bottom alt="old_change_end" src="gif/old_change_end.gif">
<P>
See section <A HREF="node207.html#WILDPATHNAMESECTION">23.1.4</A> for a discussion of
new wildcard pathname facilities.
<P>
What values are allowed for components of a pathname depends, in general,
on the pathname's host.  However, in order for pathnames to be usable
in a system-independent way, certain global conventions are adhered to.
These conventions are stronger for the type and version than for the
other components, since the type and version are explicitly manipulated by
many programs, while the other components are usually treated as something
supplied by the user that just needs to be remembered and copied
from place to place.
<P>
The type is always a string or <tt>nil</tt> or <tt>:wild</tt>.
It is expected that most
programs that deal with files will supply a default type for each file.
<P>
The version is either a positive integer or a special symbol.  The
meanings of <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>:wild</tt> have been explained
above.  The keyword <tt>:newest</tt> refers to the largest version number
that already exists in the file system when reading a file, or to
a version number
greater than any already existing in the file system
when writing a new file.  Some Common Lisp implementors
may choose to define other special version symbols.
Some semi-standard names, suggested but not required to be supported
by every Common Lisp implementation, are
<tt>:oldest</tt>, to refer to the smallest version number that exists
in the file system;
<tt>:previous</tt>, to refer to the version previous to the newest version;
and <tt>:installed</tt>, to refer to a version that is officially installed
for users (as opposed to a working or development version).
Some Common Lisp implementors may also choose to attach a meaning to
non-positive version numbers (a typical convention is that <tt>0</tt>
is synonymous with <tt>:newest</tt> and <tt>-1</tt> with <tt>:previous</tt>),
but such interpretations are implementation-dependent.
<P>
The host may be a string, indicating a file system, or a list
of strings, of which the first names the file system and the rest
may be used for such a purpose as inter-network routing.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
The device, directory, and name can each be a string (with
host-dependent rules on allowed characters and length) or possibly
some other Common Lisp data structure
(in which case such a component is said to be <i>structured</i>
and has an implementation-dependent format).
Structured components may be used to handle such file system features as
hierarchical directories.  Common Lisp programs do not need to know about
structured components unless they do host-dependent operations.
Specifying a string as a pathname component for a host that requires a
structured component will cause conversion of the string to the appropriate
form.

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-SUBDIRECTORY-LIST) <A NAME=26087>&#160;</A> 
to define a specific format for structured directories
(see section <A HREF="node206.html#STRUCTUREDDIRECTORYSECTION">23.1.3</A>).
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-COMPONENT-VALUE) <A NAME=26091>&#160;</A> 
to approve the following clarifications and specifications
of precisely what are valid values for the various components
of a pathname.
<P>
Pathname component value strings never contain the punctuation
  characters that are used to separate fields in a namestring (for example,
  slashes and
  periods as used in UNIX file systems).  Punctuation characters appear only in namestrings.
  Characters used as punctuation can appear in pathname component values
  with a non-punctuation meaning if the file system allows it (for example,
  UNIX file systems allow a file name to begin with a period).
<P>
  When examining pathname components, conforming programs must be prepared
  to encounter any of the following siutations:
  <UL>    <LI> Any component can be <tt>nil</tt>, which means the component has not
    been specified.
<P>
   <LI>  Any component can be <tt>:unspecific</tt>, which means the component has
    no meaning in this particular pathname.
<P>
   <LI>  The device, directory, name, and type can be strings.
<P>
   <LI>  The host can be any object, at the discretion of the implementation.
<P>
  <LI>  The directory can be a list of strings and symbols as described in
    section <A HREF="node206.html#STRUCTUREDDIRECTORYSECTION">23.1.3</A>.
<P>
  <LI>  The version can be any symbol or any integer.  The symbol <tt>:newest</tt>
    refers to the largest version number that already exists in the file
    system when reading, overwriting, appending, superseding, or
    directory-listing an existing file; it refers to the smallest version number
    greater than any existing version number when creating a new file.
    Other symbols and integers have implementation-defined meaning.
    It is suggested, but not required, that implementations use positive
    integers starting at 1 as version numbers, recognize the symbol <tt>:oldest</tt>
    to designate the smallest existing version number, and use keyword
    symbols for other special versions.
  </UL>
<P>
  When examining wildcard components of a wildcard pathname, conforming programs
  must be prepared to encounter any of the following additional values
  in any component or any element of a list that is the directory component:
  <UL>    <LI> The symbol <tt>:wild</tt>, which matches anything.
<P>
   <LI>  A string containing implementation-dependent special wildcard
    characters.
<P>
    <LI>  Any object, representing an implementation-dependent wildcard pattern.
  </UL>
<P>
  When constructing a pathname from components, conforming programs
  must follow these rules:
  <UL>    <LI>  Any component may be <tt>nil</tt>.  Specifying <tt>nil</tt> for the host may,
     in some implementations,
    result in using a default host
    rather than an actual <tt>nil</tt> value.
<P>
    <LI>  The host, device, directory, name, and type may be strings.  There
    are implementation-dependent limits on the number and type of
    characters in these strings.  A plausible assumption is that letters (of a single case)
    and digits are acceptable to most file systems.
<P>
    <LI>  The directory may be a list of strings and symbols as described in
    section <A HREF="node206.html#STRUCTUREDDIRECTORYSECTION">23.1.3</A>.  There are
    implementation-dependent limits on the length and contents of the list.
<P>
   <LI>  The version may be <tt>:newest</tt>.
<P>
    <LI>  Any component may be taken from the corresponding component
    of another pathname.  When the two pathnames are for different
    file systems (in implementations that support multiple file
    systems), an appropriate translation occurs.  If no meaningful
    translation is possible, an error is signaled.  The definitions
    of ``appropriate'' and ``meaningful'' are implementation-dependent.
<P>
    <LI>  When constructing a wildcard pathname, the name, type, or version
    may be <tt>:wild</tt>, which matches anything.
<P>
   <LI>  An implementation might support other values for some components,
    but a portable program should not use those values.  A conforming program
    can use implementation-dependent values but this can make it
    non-portable; for example, it might work only with UNIX file systems.
   </UL>
<P>
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">

<P>
The best way to compare two pathnames for equality is with <tt>equal</tt>,
not <tt>eql</tt>.
(On pathnames, <tt>eql</tt> is simply the same as <tt>eq</tt>.)
Two pathname objects are <tt>equal</tt> if and only if
all the corresponding components
(host, device, and so on) are equivalent.  (Whether or not
uppercase and lowercase letters are considered equivalent
in strings appearing in components depends on the file
name conventions of the file system.)  Pathnames
that are <tt>equal</tt> should be functionally equivalent.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
Some host file systems have features that do not fit into this pathname
model.  For instance, directories might be accessible as files; there
might be complicated structure in the directories or names; or there
might be a way to specify a directory relative to a
``current'' directory, such as the <tt>&lt;</tt> syntax in
MULTICS or the special ``<tt>..</tt>'' file name of UNIX.  Such
features are not allowed for by the standard Common Lisp file system
interface.  An implementation is free to accommodate such features in its
pathname representation and provide a parser that can process such
specifications in namestrings; such features are then likely to work
within that single implementation.  However, note that once a program
depends explicitly on any such features, it will not be portable.

examples in the previous paragraph no longer apply, but the principle is
still correct.
