The transformation of series expressions into loops is required to occur at
some time before compiled code is actually run.  Optimization may or may
not be applied to interpreted code.  If any of the restrictions described
below are violated, optimization is not possible.  In this situation, a
warning message is issued at the time optimization is attempted and the
code is left unoptimized.  This is not a fatal error and does not prevent
the correct results from being computed.  However, given the large
improvements in efficiency to be gained, it is well worth fixing any
violations that occur.  This is usually easy to do.

<BR><b>[Variable]</b><BR>

value of <tt>nil</tt>, warnings about conditions that block the optimization
of series expressions are suppressed.
<P>
Before the restrictions on series expressions are discussed, it will be useful to
define precisely what is meant by the term <i>series expression</i>.  This
term is semantic rather than syntactic in nature. Imagine a program
converted from Lisp code into a data flow graph.  In a data flow graph,
functions are represented as boxes, and both control flow and data flow are
represented as arrows between the boxes.  Constructs such as <tt>let</tt> and
<tt>setq</tt> are converted into patterns of data flow arcs.  Control
constructs such as <tt>if</tt> and <tt>loop</tt> are converted into patterns of
control flow arcs.  Suppose further that all loops have been converted
into tail recursions so that the graph is acyclic.
<P>
A series expression is a subgraph of the data flow graph for a program that
contains a group of interacting series functions.  More specifically, given
a call <i>f</i> on a series function, the series expression <i>E</i> containing it is
defined as follows.  <i>E</i> contains <i>f</i>.  Every function using a series
created by a function in <i>E</i> is in <i>E</i>.  Every function computing a series
used by a function in <i>E</i> is in <i>E</i>.  Finally, suppose that two functions
<i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are in <i>E</i> and that there is a data flow path consisting of
series and/or non-series data flow arcs from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>.  Every function
touched by this path (be it a series function or not) is in <i>E</i>.
<P>
<b>For optimization to be possible, series expressions have to be
statically analyzable</b>.  As with most other optimization processes, a
series expression cannot be transformed into a loop at compile time, unless
it can be determined at compile time exactly what computation is being
performed.  This places a number of relatively minor limits on what can be
written.  For example, for optimization to be possible the type arguments
to higher-order functions such as <tt>map-fn</tt> and <tt>collecting-fn</tt> have
to be quoted constants.  Similarly, the numeric arguments to <tt>chunk</tt>
have to be constants.  In addition, if <tt>funcall</tt> is used to call a
series function, the function called has to be of the
form <tt>(function ...)</tt>.
<P>
<b>For optimization to be possible, every series created within a series
expression must be used solely inside the expression</b>.  If a series is
transmitted outside of the expression that creates it, it has to be
physically represented as a whole.  This is incompatible with the
transformations required to pipeline the creating expression. To avoid this
problem, a series must not be returned as a result of a series expression
as a whole, assigned to a free variable, assigned to a special variable, or
stored in a data structure.  A corollary of the last point is that when
defining new optimizable series functions, series cannot be passed into
<tt>&amp;rest</tt> arguments.  Further, optimization is blocked if a series is
passed as an argument to an ordinary Lisp function.  Series can be
passed only to the series functions in section <A HREF="node349.html#SERIESFSECTION">A.2</A> and to new series
functions defined using the declaration <tt>optimizable-series-function</tt>.
<P>
<b>For optimization to be possible, series expressions must correspond to
straight-line computations</b>.  That is to say, the data flow graph
corresponding to a series expression cannot contain any conditional
branches.  (Complex control flow is incompatible with pipelining.)
Optimization is possible in the presence of standard straight-line forms
such as <tt>progn</tt>, <tt>funcall</tt>, <tt>setq</tt>, <tt>lambda</tt>, <tt>let</tt>,
<tt>let*</tt>, and <tt>multiple-value-bind</tt> as long
as none of the variables bound are special.  There is also no problem with
macros as long as they expand into series functions and straight-line forms.
However, optimization is blocked by forms that specify complex control flow
(i.e., conditionals <tt>if</tt>, <tt>cond</tt>, etc., looping constructs <tt>loop</tt>,
<tt>do</tt>, etc., or branching constructs <tt>tagbody</tt>, <tt>go</tt>, <tt>catch</tt>,
etc.).
<P>
In the first example below, optimization is blocked, because the <tt>if</tt>
form is inside the series expression.  In the second example, however,
optimization is possible, because although the <tt>if</tt> feeds data to the
series expression, it is not inside the corresponding subgraph.  Both of
the expressions below produce the same value, but the second one is
much more efficient.
