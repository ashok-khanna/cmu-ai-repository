<H1><A NAME=SECTION001410000000000000000>10.1. The Property List</A></H1>
<P>
Since its inception, Lisp has associated with each symbol
a kind of tabular data structure
called a <i>property list</i> (<i>plist</i> for short).  A property list contains
zero or more entries; each entry associates with a key
(called the <i>indicator</i>), which is typically
a symbol, an arbitrary Lisp object (called the <i>value</i> or,
sometimes, the <i>property</i>).
There are no duplications among the indicators; a property list may only
have one property at a time with a given name.  In this way, given
a symbol and an indicator (another symbol), an associated value can be
retrieved.
<P>
A property
list is very similar in purpose to an association list.  The difference
is that a property list is an object with a unique identity; the
operations for adding and removing property-list entries are destructive
operations that alter the property list rather than making a new one.
Association lists, on the other hand, are normally augmented
non-destructively (without side effects) by adding new entries to the
front (see <tt>acons</tt> and <tt>pairlis</tt>).
<P>
A property list is implemented as a memory cell
containing a list with an even number (possibly zero) of elements.
(Usually this memory cell is the property-list cell of a symbol,
but any memory cell acceptable to <tt>setf</tt> can be used
if <tt>getf</tt> and <tt>remf</tt> are used.)
Each pair of elements in the list constitutes an entry;
the first item is the indicator, and the second is the
value.  Because property-list functions are given the symbol
and not the list itself, modifications to the property list
can be recorded by storing back into the property-list cell of the symbol.
<P>
When a symbol is created, its property list is initially empty.
Properties are created by using <tt>get</tt> within a <tt>setf</tt> form.
<P>
Common Lisp does not use a symbol's property list as extensively as earlier
Lisp implementations did.  Less-used data, such as compiler,
debugging, and documentation information, is kept on property lists
in Common Lisp.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> In older Lisp implementations, the
print name, value, and function definition of a symbol were kept on its
property list.  The value cell was introduced into MacLisp and Interlisp
to speed up access to variables; similarly for the
print-name cell and function cell (MacLisp does not use a function cell).
Recent Lisp implementations such as Spice Lisp,
Lisp Machine Lisp, and NIL have
introduced all of these cells plus the
package cell.
None of the MacLisp system property names
(<tt>expr</tt>, <tt>fexpr</tt>, <tt>macro</tt>, <tt>array</tt>,
<tt>subr</tt>, <tt>lsubr</tt>, <tt>fsubr</tt>, and in former times <tt>value</tt> and
<tt>pname</tt>) exist in Common Lisp.
<P>
In Common Lisp, the notion of ``disembodied property list''
introduced in MacLisp is eliminated.  It tended to be used for
rather kludgy things, and in Lisp Machine Lisp is often associated with
the use of locatives (to make it ``off by one'' for searching
alternating keyword lists).  In Common Lisp special <tt>setf</tt>-like
property-list functions are introduced: <tt>getf</tt>
and <tt>remf</tt>.

<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>get <i>symbol</i> <i>indicator</i> &amp;optional <i>default</i></tt><P><tt>get</tt> searches the property list of
<i>symbol</i> for an indicator <tt>eq</tt> to <i>indicator</i>.
The first argument must be a symbol.
If one is found, then the corresponding value is returned;
otherwise <i>default</i> is returned.
<P>
If <i>default</i> is not specified,
then <tt>nil</tt> is used for <i>default</i>.
<P>
Note that there is no way to distinguish an absent property from
one whose value is <i>default</i>.
<P><pre>
(get x y) == (getf (symbol-plist x) y)
</pre><P>
Suppose that the property list of <tt>foo</tt> is <tt>(bar t baz 3 hunoz &quot;Huh?&quot;)</tt>.
Then, for example:
<P><pre>
(get 'foo 'baz) => 3 
(get 'foo 'hunoz) => &quot;Huh?&quot; 
(get 'foo 'zoo) => <tt>nil</tt>
</pre><P>
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> In MacLisp, the first argument to <tt>get</tt> could
be a list, in which case the <i>cdr</i> of the list was treated
as a so-called ``disembodied property list.''
The first argument to <tt>get</tt>
could also be any other object, in which case <tt>get</tt> would 
always return <tt>nil</tt>.  In Common Lisp, it is an error to give anything
but a symbol as the first argument to <tt>get</tt>.
<P>
What Common Lisp calls <tt>get</tt>, Interlisp calls <tt>getprop</tt>.
<P>
What MacLisp and Interlisp call <tt>putprop</tt> is accomplished
in Common Lisp by using <tt>get</tt> with <tt>setf</tt>.
<hr>
<P>
<tt>setf</tt> may be used with <tt>get</tt> to create a new property-value
pair, possibly replacing an old pair with the same property name.
For example:
<P><pre>
(get 'clyde 'species) => <tt>nil</tt> 
(setf (get 'clyde 'species) 'elephant) => elephant 
and now (get 'clyde 'species) => elephant
</pre><P>
The <i>default</i> argument may be
specified to <tt>get</tt> in this context; it is ignored by <tt>setf</tt> but
may be useful in such macros as <tt>push</tt> that are related to <tt>setf</tt>:
<P><pre>
(push item (get sym 'token-stack '(initial-item)))
</pre><P>
means approximately the same as
<P><pre>
(setf (get sym 'token-stack '(initial-item)) 
      (cons item (get sym 'token-stack '(initial-item))))
</pre><P>
which in turn would be treated as simply
<P><pre>
(setf (get sym 'token-stack) 
      (cons item (get sym 'token-stack '(initial-item))))
</pre><P>

<tt>remprop <i>symbol</i> <i>indicator</i></tt><P>This removes from <i>symbol</i> the property with an indicator <tt>eq</tt>

<tt>symbol-plist <i>symbol</i></tt><P>This returns the list that contains the property pairs of <i>symbol</i>;
the contents of the property-list cell are extracted and returned.
<P>
Note that using <tt>get</tt> on the result of <tt>symbol-plist</tt> does <i>not</i> work.
One must give the symbol itself to <tt>get</tt> or else
use the function <tt>getf</tt>.
<P>
<tt>setf</tt> may be used with <tt>symbol-plist</tt> to destructively replace
the entire property list of a symbol.  This is a relatively dangerous
operation, as it may destroy important information that
the implementation may happen to store in property lists.
Also, care must be taken that the new
property list is in fact a list of even length.

<tt>setf</tt> may be used with <tt>getf</tt>, in which case the <i>place</i> must

add a new property-value pair, or update an existing pair,

<tt>get-properties <i>place</i> <i>indicator-list</i></tt><P><tt>get-properties</tt> is like <tt>getf</tt>, except that the second

<tt>get-properties</tt> returns three values.
If any property was found, then
the first two values are the indicator
and value for the first property whose indicator was in <i>indicator-list</i>,
and the third is that tail of the property list whose <i>car</i>
was the indicator (and whose <i>cadr</i> is therefore the value).
If no property was found, all three values are <tt>nil</tt>.
Thus the third value serves as a flag indicating success or failure
and also allows the search to be restarted, if desired, after the property
was found.
