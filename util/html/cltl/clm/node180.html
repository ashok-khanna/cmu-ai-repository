<P>
The function <tt>eval</tt> is the main user interface to the evaluator.
Hooks are provided for user-supplied debugging routines
to obtain control during the execution of an interpretive evaluator.
The functions <tt>evalhook</tt> and <tt>applyhook</tt> provide alternative
interfaces to the evaluator mechanism for use by these debugging routines.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>eval <i>form</i></tt><P>The <i>form</i> is evaluated in the current dynamic environment and
a null lexical environment.  Whatever results from the evaluation
is returned from the call to <tt>eval</tt>.
<P>
Note that when you write a call to <tt>eval</tt> <i>two</i> levels
of evaluation occur on the argument form you write.
First the argument form is evaluated, as for arguments to any function,
by the usual argument evaluation mechanism
(which involves an implicit use of <tt>eval</tt>).  Then the argument
is passed to the <tt>eval</tt> function, where another evaluation occurs.
For example:
<P><pre>
(eval (list 'cdr (car '((quote (a . b)) c)))) => b
</pre><P>
The argument form <tt>(list 'cdr (car '((quote (a . b)) c)))</tt> is evaluated
in the usual way to produce the argument <tt>(cdr (quote (a . b)))</tt>;
this is then given to <tt>eval</tt> because <tt>eval</tt> is being called explicitly,
and <tt>eval</tt> evaluates its argument <tt>(cdr (quote (a . b)))</tt> to produce <tt>b</tt>.
<P>
If all that is required for some application is
to obtain the current dynamic value of a given symbol, the function
<tt>symbol-value</tt> may be more efficient than <tt>eval</tt>.

this is called the <i>eval hook function</i>.
When a form is to be evaluated (any form at all, even a number or a symbol),
whether implicitly or via an explicit call to <tt>eval</tt>, no attempt
is made to evaluate the form.
Instead, the hook function is invoked and is passed the form to be evaluated
as its first argument.  The hook function is then responsible for
evaluating the form; whatever is returned by the hook function is assumed
to be the result of evaluating the form.
<P>
The variable <tt>*applyhook*</tt> is similar to <tt>*evalhook*</tt> but is used
when a function is about to be applied to arguments.
If the value of <tt>*applyhook*</tt> is not <tt>nil</tt>, then <tt>eval</tt> behaves

to revise the definition of <tt>*applyhook*</tt>.
Its value should be a function of <i>two</i> arguments,
a function and a list of arguments; no environment information is passed
to an apply hook function.

<P>
This was simply a flaw in the first edition.  Sorry about that.
<P>
When a function is about to be applied to a list of arguments,
no attempt is made to apply the function.
Instead, the hook function is invoked and is passed the function and the list
of arguments
as its first and second arguments.  The hook function is then responsible for
evaluating the form; whatever is returned by the hook function is assumed
to be the result of evaluating the form.
The apply hook function is used only for application of ordinary functions
within <tt>eval</tt>.  It is not used for applications via <tt>apply</tt> or
<tt>funcall</tt>, for applications by such functions as <tt>map</tt> or
<tt>reduce</tt>, or for invocation of macro-expansion functions
by either <tt>eval</tt> or <tt>macroexpand</tt>.

X3J13 voted in June 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE) <A NAME=19164>&#160;</A>  to specify
that the value of <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> is first coerced to a
function before being called as the expansion interface hook.
This vote made no mention of <tt>*evalhook*</tt> or <tt>*applyhook*</tt>,
but this may have been an oversight.
<P>
A proposal was submitted to X3J13 in September 1989 to specify
that the value of <tt>*evalhook*</tt> or <tt>*applyhook*</tt> is first coerced to a
function before being called.  If this proposal is accepted,
the value of either variable may be <tt>nil</tt>, any other symbol,
a lambda-expression, or any object of type <tt>function</tt>.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
The last argument passed to either kind of hook function contains information
about the lexical environment in an implementation-dependent format.
These arguments are suitable for the functions
<tt>evalhook</tt>, <tt>applyhook</tt>, and <tt>macroexpand</tt>.
<P>
When either kind of hook function is invoked, both of the variables
<tt>*evalhook*</tt>
and <tt>*applyhook*</tt> are rebound to the value <tt>nil</tt> around the invocation
of the hook function.  This is so that the hook function will not be
invoked recursively on evaluations and applications that occur
in the course of executing the code of the hook function.
The functions <tt>evalhook</tt>
and <tt>applyhook</tt> are useful for performing recursive evaluations
and applications within the hook function.
<P>
The hook feature is provided as an aid to debugging.
The <tt>step</tt> facility is implemented using this hook.
<P>
If a non-local exit causes a throw back to the top level
of Lisp, perhaps because an error could not
be corrected, then <tt>*evalhook*</tt> and <tt>*applyhook*</tt> are
automatically reset to <tt>nil</tt> as a safety feature.

</pre>
<P>The functions <tt>evalhook</tt> and <tt>applyhook</tt> are provided to make it
easier to exploit the hook feature.
<P>
In the case of <tt>evalhook</tt>, the <i>form</i> is evaluated.
In the case of <tt>applyhook</tt>, the <i>function</i> is applied to the
list of arguments <i>args</i>.  In either case,
for the duration of the operation
the variable <tt>*evalhook*</tt> is bound to <i>evalhookfn</i>, and
<tt>*applyhook*</tt> is bound to <i>applyhookfn</i>.
Furthermore, the <i>env</i> argument
is used as the lexical environment for the operation;
<i>env</i> defaults to the null environment.
The check for a hook function is <i>bypassed</i> for the evaluation
of the <i>form</i> itself (for <tt>evalhook</tt>) or for the application
of the <i>function</i> to the <i>args</i> itself (for <tt>applyhook</tt>),
but not for subsidiary evaluations and applications
such as evaluations of subforms.  It is this one-shot bypass that makes
<tt>evalhook</tt> and <tt>applyhook</tt> so useful.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(APPLYHOOK-ENVIROMENT) <A NAME=19209>&#160;</A> 
to eliminate the optional <i>env</i>
parameter to <tt>applyhook</tt>, because it is not (and cannot)
be useful.  Any function that can be applied carries its own
environment and does not need another environment to be specified
separately.
This was a flaw in the first edition.

Here is an example of a very simple tracing routine that uses just the
<tt>evalhook</tt> feature.
<P><pre>
(defvar *hooklevel* 0) 

(defun hook (x) 
  (let ((*evalhook* 'eval-hook-function)) 
    (eval x))) 

(defun eval-hook-function (form <tt>&amp;rest</tt> env) 
  (let ((*hooklevel* (+ *hooklevel* 1))) 
    (format *trace-output* &quot;~%~V@TForm:  ~S&quot; 
            (* *hooklevel* 2) form) 
    (let ((values (multiple-value-list 
                     (evalhook form 
                               #'eval-hook-function 
                               <tt>nil</tt> 
                               env)))) 
      (format *trace-output* &quot;~%~V@TValue:~{ ~S~}&quot; 
              (* *hooklevel* 2) values) 
      (values-list values))))
</pre><P>
Using these routines, one might see the following interaction:
<P><pre>
(hook '(cons (floor *print-base* 2) 'b)) 
  Form:  (CONS (FLOOR *PRINT-BASE* 2) (QUOTE B)) 
    Form:  (FLOOR *PRINT-BASE* 3) 
      Form:  *PRINT-BASE* 
      Value: 10 
      Form:  3 
      Value: 3 
    Value: 3 1 
    Form:  (QUOTE B) 
    Value: B 
  Value: (3 . B) 
(3 . B)

<tt>constantp <i>object</i></tt><P>If the predicate <tt>constantp</tt> is true of an object,
then that object, when considered as a form to
be evaluated, always evaluates to the same thing;
it is a constant.

strings, bit-vectors, and keywords, as well as all constant symbols
declared by <tt>defconstant</tt>,
such as <tt>nil</tt>, <tt>t</tt>, and <tt>pi</tt>.
In addition, a list whose <i>car</i> is <tt>quote</tt>,
such as <tt>(quote foo)</tt>, is considered to be a constant.

that object, considered as a form,
might or might not always evaluate to the same thing.
