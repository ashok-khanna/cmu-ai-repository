<P>
To <i>load</i> a file is to read through the file, evaluating each form in
it.  Programs are typically stored in files containing calls to
constructs such as <tt>defun</tt>, <tt>defmacro</tt>,
and <tt>defvar</tt>, which define
the functions and variables of the program.
<P>
Loading a compiled (``fasload'') file is similar, except that the file does not
contain text but rather pre-digested expressions created by the
compiler that can be loaded more quickly.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>load <i>filename</i> &amp;key :verbose :print :if-does-not-exist</tt><P>This function loads the file named by <i>filename</i> into the Lisp
environment.  It is assumed that a text (character file) can be
automatically distinguished from an object (binary) file by some appropriate
implementation-dependent means, possibly by the file type.
The defaults for <i>filename</i> are taken from the variable
<tt>*default-pathname-defaults*</tt>.
If the <i>filename</i> (after the merging in of the defaults)
does not explicitly specify a type,
and both text and object types of the file are available in the file system,
<tt>load</tt> should
try to select the more appropriate file by some implementation-dependent means.
<P>
If the first argument is a stream rather than a pathname,
then <tt>load</tt> determines what kind of stream it is and loads
directly from the stream.
<P>
The <tt>:verbose</tt> argument (which defaults to the value of
<tt>*load-verbose*</tt>), if true, permits <tt>load</tt> to print a message
in the form of a comment (that is, with a leading
semicolon) to <tt>*standard-output*</tt> indicating what
file is being loaded and other useful information.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
The <tt>:print</tt> argument (default <tt>nil</tt>),
if true, causes the value of each expression
loaded to be printed to <tt>*standard-output*</tt>.  If a binary file is
being loaded, then what is printed may not reflect precisely the contents
of the source file, but nevertheless some information will be printed.

X3J13 voted in March 1989 (COMPILER-VERBOSITY) <A NAME=27601>&#160;</A> 
to add the variable <tt>*load-print*</tt>; its value is used as the default
for the <tt>:print</tt> argument to <tt>load</tt>.
<P>
The function <tt>load</tt> rebinds <tt>*package*</tt> to its current value.  If
some form in the file changes the value of <tt>*package*</tt> during loading,
the old value will be restored when the loading is completed.
(This was specified in the first edition under the description of <tt>*package*</tt>;
for convenience I now mention it here as well.)
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1988
(PATHNAME-STREAM) <A NAME=27613>&#160;</A> 
to specify exactly which streams may be used as pathnames.
See section <A HREF="node214.html#PATHNAMEFUNCTIONS">23.1.6</A>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-WILD) <A NAME=27617>&#160;</A> 
to clarify that supplying a wild pathname
as the <i>filename</i> argument to <tt>load</tt> has implementation-dependent consequences;
<tt>load</tt> might signal an error, for example,
or might load all files that match the pathname.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-LOGICAL) <A NAME=27623>&#160;</A>  to require <tt>load</tt>
to accept logical pathnames (see section <A HREF="node208.html#LOGICALPATHNAMESSECTION">23.1.5</A>).
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
If a file is successfully loaded, <tt>load</tt> always returns a non-<tt>nil</tt>
value.  If <tt>:if-does-not-exist</tt> is specified and is <tt>nil</tt>,
<tt>load</tt> just returns <tt>nil</tt> rather than signaling an error if the file
does not exist.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (IN-SYNTAX) <A NAME=27634>&#160;</A> 
to require that <tt>load</tt> bind <tt>*readtable*</tt> to its current value
at the time <tt>load</tt> is called; the dynamic extent of the binding
should encompass all of the file-loading activity.
This allows a portable program to include forms such as
<P><pre>
(in-package &quot;FOO&quot;) 

(eval-when (:execute :load-toplevel :compile-toplevel) 
  (setq *readtable* foo:my-readtable))
</pre><P>
without performing a net global side effect on the loading environment.
Such statements allow the remainder of such a file to be read either as
interpreted code or by <tt>compile-file</tt> in a syntax determined by
an alternative readtable.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (LOAD-TRUENAME) <A NAME=27643>&#160;</A> 
to require that <tt>load</tt> bind two new variables
<tt>*load-pathname*</tt> and <tt>*load-truename*</tt>; the dynamic extent of the bindings
should encompass all of the file-loading activity.

<tt>*load-pathname*</tt><P>X3J13 voted in June 1989 (LOAD-TRUENAME) <A NAME=27664>&#160;</A>  to introduce <tt>*load-pathname*</tt>;
it is initially <tt>nil</tt> but <tt>load</tt> binds it to a pathname that
represents the file name given as the first argument to <tt>load</tt> merged
with the defaults (see <tt>merge-pathname</tt>).
<P>
<BR><b>[Variable]</b><BR>
<tt>*load-truename*</tt><P>X3J13 voted in June 1989 (LOAD-TRUENAME) <A NAME=27672>&#160;</A>  to introduce <tt>*load-truename*</tt>;
it is initially <tt>nil</tt> but <tt>load</tt> binds it to the ``true name'' of
the file being loaded.  See <tt>truename</tt>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (LOAD-OBJECTS) <A NAME=27680>&#160;</A>  to introduce a facility
based on the Object System
whereby a user can specify how <tt>compile-file</tt> and <tt>load</tt>
must cooperate to reconstruct compile-time constant objects at load time.
The protocol is simply this:
  <tt>compile-file</tt> calls the generic
  function <tt>make-load-form</tt> on any object that is referenced as
  a constant or as a self-evaluating form, if the object's metaclass is
  <tt>standard-class</tt>, <tt>structure-class</tt>, any user-defined metaclass (not a
  subclass of <tt>built-in-class</tt>), or any of a possibly empty
  implementation-defined list of other metaclasses; <tt>compile-file</tt> will
  call <tt>make-load-form</tt> only once for any given object (as determined by <tt>eq</tt>)
  within a single file.  The user-programmability stems from the possibility
  of user-defined methods for <tt>make-load-form</tt>.  The helper function
  <tt>make-load-form-saving-slots</tt> makes it easy to write commonly used
  versions of such methods.
<P>
<BR><b>[Generic function]</b><BR>
<tt>make-load-form <i>object</i></tt><P>The argument is an object that is
  referenced as a constant or as a self-evaluating form in a file being
  compiled by <tt>compile-file</tt>.  The objective is to enable <tt>load</tt> to
  construct an equivalent object.
<P>
  The first value, called the <i>creation form</i>, is a form that, when
  evaluated at load time, should return an object that is equivalent to
  the argument.  The exact meaning of ``equivalent'' depends on the type
  of object and is up to the programmer who defines a method for
  <tt>make-load-form</tt>.  This allows the user to program the notion
  of ``similar as a constant'' (see section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).
<P>
  The second value, called the <i>initialization form</i>, is a form that,
  when evaluated at load time, should perform further initialization of
  the object.  The value returned by the initialization form is ignored.
  If the <tt>make-load-form</tt> method returns only one value, the
  initialization form is <tt>nil</tt>, which has no effect.  If the object used
  as the argument to <tt>make-load-form</tt> appears as a constant in the
  initialization form, at load time it will be replaced by the
  equivalent object constructed by the creation form; this is how the
  further initialization gains access to the object.
<P>
  Two values are returned so that circular structures may be handled.
  The order of evaluation rules discussed below
  for creation and initialization forms
  eliminates the possibility of partially initialized objects in the
  absence of circular structures and reduces the possibility to a minimum
  in the presence of circular structures.  This allows nodes in
  non-circular structures to be built out of fully initialized subparts.
<P>
  Both the creation form and the initialization form can contain
  references to objects of user-defined types (defined precisely below).
  However, there must not be any circular dependencies in creation forms.
  An example of a circular dependency: the creation form for the
  object <i>X</i> contains a reference to the object <i>Y</i>, and the creation form
  for the object <i>Y</i> contains a reference to the object <i>X</i>.  A simpler
  example: the creation form for the object <i>X</i> contains
  a reference to <i>X</i> itself.  Initialization forms are not subject to
  any restriction against circular dependencies, which is the entire
  reason for having initialization forms.  See the example of circular
  data structures below.
<P>
  The creation form for an object is always evaluated before the
  initialization form for that object.  When either the creation form or
  the initialization form refers to other objects of user-defined types
  that have not been referenced earlier in the <tt>compile-file</tt>, the
  compiler collects all of the creation and initialization forms.  Each
  initialization form is evaluated as soon as possible after its
  creation form, as determined by data flow.  If the initialization form
  for an object does not refer to any other objects of user-defined
  types that have not been referenced earlier in the <tt>compile-file</tt>, the
  initialization form is evaluated immediately after the creation form.
  If a creation or initialization form <i>F</i> references other objects of
  user-defined types that have not been referenced earlier in the
  <tt>compile-file</tt>, the creation forms for those other objects are evaluated
  before <i>F</i> and the initialization forms for those other objects are
  also evaluated before <i>F</i> whenever they do not depend on the object
  created or initialized by <i>F</i>.  Where the above rules do not uniquely
  determine an order of evaluation, it is unspecified
  which of the possible orders of evaluation is chosen.
<P>
  While these creation and initialization forms are being evaluated, the
  objects are possibly in an uninitialized state, analogous to the state
  of an object between the time it has been created by <tt>allocate-instance</tt>
  and it has been processed fully by <tt>initialize-instance</tt>.  Programmers
  writing methods for <tt>make-load-form</tt> must take care in manipulating
  objects not to depend on slots that have not yet been initialized.
<P>
  It is unspecified whether <tt>load</tt> calls <tt>eval</tt> on the forms or does some
  other operation that has an equivalent effect.  For example, the
  forms might be translated into different but equivalent forms and
  then evaluated; they might be compiled and the resulting functions
  called by <tt>load</tt> (after they themselves have been loaded);
  or they might be interpreted by a special-purpose
  interpreter different from <tt>eval</tt>.  All that is required is that the
  effect be equivalent to evaluating the forms.
<P>
  It is valid for user programs to call <tt>make-load-form</tt> in
  circumstances other than compilation, providing the argument's
  metaclass is not <tt>built-in-class</tt> or a subclass of <tt>built-in-class</tt>.
<P>
  Applying <tt>make-load-form</tt> to an object whose metaclass is <tt>standard-class</tt> or
  <tt>structure-class</tt> for which no user-defined method is applicable signals
  an error.  It is valid to implement this either by defining default
  methods for the classes <tt>standard-object</tt> and <tt>structure-object</tt> that signal an error
  or by having no applicable method for those classes.
<P>
See <tt>load-time-eval</tt>.
<P>
In the following example, an equivalent instance of <tt>my-class</tt> is reconstructed
  by using the values of two of its slots.  The value of the third slot
  is derived from those two values.
<P><pre>
(defclass my-class ()
  ((a :initarg :a :reader my-a) 
   (b :initarg :b :reader my-b) 
   (c :accessor my-c))) 

(defmethod shared-initialize ((self my-class) slots &amp;rest inits) 
  (declare (ignore slots inits)) 
  (unless (slot-boundp self 'c) 
    (setf (my-c self) 
          (some-computation (my-a self) (my-b self))))) 

(defmethod make-load-form ((self my-class)) 
  `(make-instance ',(class-name (class-of self)) 
                  :a ',(my-a self) :b ',(my-b self)))
</pre><P>
This code will fail if either of the first two slots of some instance
of <tt>my-class</tt> contains the instance itself.
Another way to write the last form in the preceding example is
<P><pre>
(defmethod make-load-form ((self my-class)) 
  (make-load-form-saving-slots self '(a b)))
</pre><P>
This has the advantages of conciseness and handling circularities correctly.
<P>
In the next example, instances of class <tt>my-frob</tt> are ``interned'' in some way.
  An equivalent instance is reconstructed by using the value of the
  <tt>name</tt> slot as a key for searching for existing objects.  In this case
  the programmer has chosen to create a new object if no existing
  object is found; an alternative possibility would be to signal an
  error in that case.
<P><pre>
(defclass my-frob () 
  ((name :initarg :name :reader my-name))) 

(defmethod make-load-form ((self my-frob)) 
  `(find-my-frob ',(my-name self) :if-does-not-exist :create))
</pre><P>
<P>
  In the following example, the data structure to be dumped is circular, because
  each node of a tree has a list of its children and each child has a reference
  back to its parent.  
<P><pre>
(defclass tree-with-parent () ((parent :accessor tree-parent) 
                               (children :initarg :children)))
</pre><P>
<P>
<P><pre>
(defmethod make-load-form ((x tree-with-parent)) 
  (values 
    `(make-instance ',(class-of x) 
                    :children ',(slot-value x 'children)) 
    `(setf (tree-parent ',x) ',(slot-value x 'parent))))
</pre><P>
Suppose <tt>make-load-form</tt> is called on one object in
  such a structure.  The creation form creates an equivalent object and
  fills in the <tt>children</tt> slot, which forces creation of equivalent
  objects for all of its children, grandchildren, etc.  At this point
  none of the parent slots have been filled in.  The initialization form
  fills in the <tt>parent</tt> slot, which forces creation of an equivalent
  object for the parent if it was not already created.  Thus the entire
  tree is recreated at load time.  At compile time, <tt>make-load-form</tt> is
  called once for each object in the tree.  All the creation forms
  are evaluated, in unspecified order, and then all  the
  initialization forms are evaluated, also in unspecified order.
<P>
  In this final example, the data structure to be dumped has no special
  properties and an equivalent structure can be reconstructed
  simply by reconstructing the slots' contents.
<P><pre>
(defstruct my-struct a b c) 

(defmethod make-load-form ((s my-struct)) 
  (make-load-form-saving-slots s))
</pre><P>
This is easy to code using <tt>make-load-form-saving-slots</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>make-load-form-saving-slots <i>object</i> &amp;optional <i>slots</i></tt><P>This returns two values suitable for return from a <tt>make-load-form</tt> method.
  The first argument is the object.  The optional second argument is a
  list of the names of slots to preserve; it defaults to all of the
  local slots.
<P>
<tt>make-load-form-saving-slots</tt> returns forms that construct
  an equivalent object using <tt>make-instance</tt>
  and <tt>setf</tt> of <tt>slot-value</tt> for
  slots with values, or <tt>slot-makunbound</tt> for slots without values, or
  other functions of equivalent effect.
<P>
  Because <tt>make-load-form-saving-slots</tt> returns two values, it can deal with
  circular structures; it works for any object
  of metaclass <tt>standard-class</tt> or <tt>structure-class</tt>.
  Whether the result is
  useful depends on whether the object's type and slot
  contents fully capture an application's idea of the object's state.
