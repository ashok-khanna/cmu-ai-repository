<P>
This section contains discussion of only those operations that
are common to all streams.  Input and output is rather complicated
and is discussed separately in chapter <A HREF="node186.html#IO">22</A>.
The interface between streams and the file system is discussed
in chapter <A HREF="node202.html#FILES">23</A>.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(CLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS) <A NAME=19653>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>streamp</tt> is unaffected
by whether its argument, if a stream, is open or closed.  In either case
it returns true.

<tt>open-stream-p <i>stream</i></tt><P>
X3J13 voted in January 1989 (STREAM-ACCESS) <A NAME=19659>&#160;</A> 
to add the predicate <tt>open-stream-p</tt>.
It is true if its argument (which must be a stream)
is open, and otherwise is false.
<P>
A stream is always created open; it remains open until closed
with the <tt>close</tt> function.  The macros <tt>with-open-stream</tt>,
<tt>with-input-from-string</tt>, <tt>with-output-to-string</tt>,
and <tt>with-open-file</tt> automatically close the created stream
as control leaves their bodies, in effect imposing dynamic extent
on the openness of the stream.

<tt>stream-element-type <i>stream</i></tt><P>A type specifier is returned to indicate what objects

Streams created by <tt>open</tt> will have an element type
restricted to a subset of <tt>character</tt> or <tt>integer</tt>,
but in principle a stream may conduct transactions using any
Lisp objects.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>close <i>stream</i> &amp;key :abort</tt><P>The argument must be a stream.
The stream is closed.  No further input/output operations may be performed
on it.  However, certain inquiry operations may still be performed,
and it is permissible to close an already closed stream.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(CLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS) <A NAME=19680>&#160;</A> 
and revised the vote in March 1989
to specify that if <tt>close</tt> is called
on an open stream, the stream is closed and <tt>t</tt> is returned;
but if <tt>close</tt> is called on a closed stream, it succeeds without
error and returns an unspecified value.
(The rationale for not specifying the value returned for a closed stream
is that in some implementations closing certain streams does not really
have an effect on them-for example, closing the <tt>*terminal-io*</tt>
stream might not ``really'' close it-and it is not desirable to force
such implementations to keep otherwise unnecessary state.  Portable programs
will of course not rely on such behavior.)
<P>
X3J13 also voted in January 1989 to specify exactly which inquiry
functions may be applied to closed streams:
<PRE>
streamp            pathname-host         namestring 
pathname           pathname-device       file-namestring 
truename           pathname-directory    directory-namestring 
merge-pathnames    pathname-name         host-namestring 
open               pathname-type         enough-namestring 
probe-file         pathname-version      directory 
</PRE>
See the individual descriptions of these functions for more information
on how they operate on closed streams.
<P>
X3J13 voted in January 1989
(CLOSE-CONSTRUCTED-STREAM) <A NAME=19712>&#160;</A> 
to clarify the effect of closing various
kinds of streams.  First some terminology:
<UL><LI>
A <i>composite</i> stream is one that was returned by a call to
<tt>make-synonym-stream</tt>,
<tt>make-broadcast-stream</tt>,
<tt>make-concatenated-stream</tt>,
<tt>make-two-way-stream</tt>,
or <tt>make-echo-stream</tt>.
<P>
<LI>
The <i>constituents</i> of a composite stream are the streams that were given
as arguments to the function that constructed it or, in the case of
<tt>make-synonym-stream</tt>, the stream that is the <tt>symbol-value</tt> of
the symbol that was given as an argument.  (The constituent of
a synonym stream may therefore vary over time.)
<P>
<LI>
A <i>constructed</i> stream is either a composite stream or one returned
by a call to <tt>make-string-input-stream</tt>, <tt>make-string-output-stream</tt>,
<tt>with-input-from-string</tt>, or
<tt>with-output-to-string</tt>.
</UL>
<P>
The effect of applying <tt>close</tt> to a constructed stream is to close
that stream only.  No input/output operations are permitted on the
constructed stream once it has been closed (though certain inquiry
functions are still permitted, as described above).
<P>
Closing a composite stream has no effect on its constituents;
any constituents that are open remain open.
<P>
If a stream created by <tt>make-string-output-stream</tt> is closed,
the result of then applying <tt>get-output-stream-string</tt> to the
stream is unspecified.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
If the <tt>:abort</tt> parameter is not <tt>nil</tt> (it defaults to <tt>nil</tt>), it
indicates an abnormal termination of the use of the stream.  An attempt
is made to clean up any side effects of having created the stream in the
first place.  For example, if the stream performs output to a file
that was newly created when the stream was created, then if possible the
file is deleted and any previously existing file is not superseded.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in January 1989
(STREAM-ACCESS) <A NAME=19763>&#160;</A> 
to add the following accessor functions
for obtaining information about streams.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>broadcast-stream-streams <i>broadcast-stream</i></tt><P>The argument must be of type <tt>broadcast-stream</tt>.
A list of the constituent output streams (whether open or not) is returned.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>concatenated-stream-streams <i>concatenated-stream</i></tt><P>The argument must be of type <tt>concatenated-stream</tt>.
A list of constituent streams (whether open or not) is returned.
This list represents the ordered set of input streams from which
the concatenated stream may yet read; the stream from which it is
currently reading is first in the list.  The list may be empty
if no more streams remain to be read.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>echo-stream-input-stream <i>echo-stream</i> <BR></tt><tt>echo-stream-output-stream <i>echo-stream</i></tt><P>The argument must be of type <tt>echo-stream</tt>.
The function <tt>echo-stream-input-stream</tt> returns the constituent
input stream; <tt>echo-stream-output-stream</tt> returns the constituent
output stream.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>synonym-stream-symbol <i>synonym-stream</i></tt><P>The argument must be of type <tt>synonym-stream</tt>.  This function returns
the symbol for whose value the <i>synonym-stream</i> is a synonym.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>two-way-stream-input-stream <i>two-way-stream</i> <BR></tt><tt>two-way-stream-output-stream <i>two-way-stream</i></tt><P>The argument must be of type <tt>two-way-stream</tt>.
The function <tt>two-way-stream-input-stream</tt> returns the constituent
input stream; <tt>two-way-stream-output-stream</tt> returns the constituent
output stream.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>interactive-stream-p <i>stream</i></tt><P>X3J13 voted in June 1989 (STREAM-CAPABILITIES) <A NAME=19819>&#160;</A>  to add the
predicate <tt>interactive-stream-p</tt>, which returns <tt>t</tt>
if the <i>stream</i> is interactive and otherwise returns <tt>nil</tt>.
A <tt>type-error</tt> error is signalled if the argument is not of type <tt>stream</tt>.
<P>
The precise meaning of <tt>interactive-stream-p</tt> is implementation-dependent
and may depend on the underlying operating system.
The intent is to distinguish between interactive and batch (background,
command-file) operations.  Some characteristics that might
distinguish a stream as interactive:
<UL><LI> The stream is connected to a person (or the equivalent)
in such a way that the program can prompt for information and
expect to receive input that might depend on the prompt.<p>
<LI> The program is expected to prompt for input and to support
``normal input editing protocol'' for that operating environment.<p>
<LI> A call to <tt>read-char</tt> might hang waiting for the user to type something
rather than quickly returning a character or an end-of-file
indication.<p>
</UL>
The value of <tt>*terminal-io*</tt> might or might not be interactive.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>stream-external-format <i>stream</i></tt><P>X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=19837>&#160;</A>  to add the
function <tt>stream-external-format</tt>, which returns a
specifier for the implementation-recognized scheme used for
representing characters in the argument <i>stream</i>.
See the <tt>:external-format</tt> argument to <tt>open</tt>.
