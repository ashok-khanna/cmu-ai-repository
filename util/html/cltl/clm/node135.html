<P>
Common Lisp provides a character data type; objects of this type
represent printed symbols such as letters.
<P>
In general, characters in Common Lisp are not true objects; <tt>eq</tt> cannot
be counted upon to operate on them reliably.  In particular,
it is possible that the expression
<P><pre>
(let ((x z) (y z)) (eq x y))
</pre><P>
may be false rather than true, if the value of <tt>z</tt> is a character.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Rationale:</b> This odd breakdown of <tt>eq</tt> in the case of characters
allows the implementor enough design freedom to produce exceptionally
efficient code on conventional architectures.  In this respect the
treatment of characters exactly parallels that of numbers, as described
in chapter <A HREF="node121.html#NUMBER">12</A>.

<p>

If two objects are to be compared for ``identity,'' but either might be
a character, then the predicate <tt>eql</tt> is probably appropriate.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=14406>&#160;</A> 
to approve the following definitions and terminology for use in
discussing character facilities in Common Lisp.
<P>
A <i>character repertoire</i> defines a collection of characters
independent of their specific rendered image or font.  (This corresponds
to the mathematical notion of a set, but the term <i>character set</i>
is avoided here because it has been used in the past to mean
both what is here called a repertoire and what is here called a coded
character set.)
Character repertoires are specified independent of coding and their characters
are identified only with a unique <i>character label</i>,
a graphic symbol, and a character description.
As an example, table <A HREF="node135.html#STANDARDCHARREPERTOIRETABLE">13-1</A>
shows the character labels, graphic symbols, and character descriptions for
all of the characters in the repertoire <tt>standard-char</tt>
except for <tt>#\Space</tt> and <tt>#\Newline</tt>.
<P>
Every Common Lisp implementation must support the standard character repertoire
as well as repertoires named <tt>base-character</tt>, <tt>extended-character</tt>,
and <tt>character</tt>.  Other repertoires may be supported as well.
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=14417>&#160;</A>  to specify that names of
repertoires may be used as type specifiers.  Such types must be subtypes of <tt>character</tt>;
that is, in a given implementation
the repertoire named <tt>character</tt> must encompass all the character objects supported
by that implementation.
<P>
A <i>coded character set</i> is a character repertoire plus an <i>encoding</i>
that provides a bijective mapping between each character in the set and a number
(typically a non-negative integer)
that serves as the character representation.
There are numerous internationally standardized coded character sets.
<P>
A character may be included in one or more character repertoires.
Similarly, a character may be included in one or more coded character sets.
<P>
To ensure that each character is uniquely defined, we may use a universal registry of
characters that incorporates a collection of distinguished repertoires
called <i>character scripts</i> that form an exhaustive partition of all characters.
That is, each character is included in exactly one character script.
(Draft ISO 10646 Coded Character Set Standard, if eventually approved as a standard,
may become the practical realization of this universal registry.)
<P>
(X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=14423>&#160;</A>  to specify that
an implementation must document the character scripts it supports.
For each script the documentation should discuss character labels,
glyphs, and descriptions; any canonicalization processes performed
by the reader that result in treating distinct characters as equivalent;
any canonicalization performed by <tt>format</tt> in processing directives;
the behavior of <tt>char-upcase</tt>, <tt>char-downcase</tt>, and the predicates
<tt>alpha-char-p</tt>, <tt>upper-case-p</tt>, <tt>lower-case-p</tt>, <tt>both-case-p</tt>,
<tt>graphic-char-p</tt>, <tt>alphanumericp</tt>, <tt>char-equal</tt>, <tt>char-not-equal</tt>,
<tt>char-lessp</tt>, <tt>char-greaterp</tt>, <tt>char-not-greaterp</tt>, and <tt>char-not-lessp</tt>
for characters in the script; and behavior with respect to input and output,
including coded character sets and external coding schemes.)
<P>
In Common Lisp a <i>character</i> data object is identified by its <i>character code</i>,
a unique numerical code.  Each character code is composed from a character script
and a character label.  The convention by which a character script and
character label compose a character code is implementation dependent.
[X3J13 did not approve all parts of the proposal from its Subcommittee
on Characters.  As a result, some features that were approved appear to
have no purpose.  X3J13 wished to support the standardization by ISO of character
scripts and coded character sets but declined to design facilities for use in
Common Lisp until there has been more progress by ISO in this area.
The approval of the terminology for scripts and labels gives a hint
to implementors of likely directions for Common Lisp in the future.]
<P>
A character object that is classified as <i>graphic</i>, or displayable,
has an associated <i>glpyh</i>.  The glyph is the visual representation
of the character.  All other character data objects are classified as
<i>non-graphic</i>.
<P>
This terminology assigns names to Common Lisp concepts
in a manner consistent with
related concepts discussed in various ISO standards for coded
character sets and provides a demarcation between standardization
activities.  For example, facilities for manipulating characters,
character scripts, and coded character sets are properly defined
by a Common Lisp standard, but Common Lisp should not define
standard character sets or standard character scripts.
