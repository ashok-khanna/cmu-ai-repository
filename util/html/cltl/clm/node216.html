These functions provide a standard interface to operations provided
in some form by most file systems.  It may be that some implementations
of Common Lisp cannot support them all completely.

<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>rename-file <i>file</i> <i>new-name</i></tt><P>The specified <i>file</i> is renamed to <i>new-name</i> (which must be a file name).
The <i>file</i> may be a string, a pathname, or a stream.  If it is an open stream
associated with a file, then the stream itself and the file associated
with it are affected (if the file system permits).

<tt>rename-file</tt> returns three values if successful.  The first value
is the <i>new-name</i> with any missing components filled in by performing
a <tt>merge-pathnames</tt> operation using <i>file</i> as the defaults.
The second value is the <tt>truename</tt> of the file before it was renamed.
The third value is the <tt>truename</tt> of the file after it was renamed.
<P>
If the renaming operation is not successful, an error is signaled.

<b>Compatibility note:</b> This corresponds to the function
called <tt>renamef</tt> in MacLisp and Lisp Machine Lisp.
The name <tt>renamef</tt> is not used in Common Lisp
because the convention that a trailing <tt>f</tt> means ``file''
conflicts with the use of a trailing <tt>f</tt>
for forms related to <tt>setf</tt>.

<tt>delete-file <i>file</i></tt><P>The specified <i>file</i> is deleted.  The <i>file</i> may be a string, a
pathname, or a stream.  If it is an open stream associated with a file,
then the stream itself and the file associated with it are affected (if
the file system permits), in which case the stream may or may not be
closed immediately, and the deletion may be immediate or delayed until
the stream is explicitly closed, depending on the requirements of the
file system.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(CLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS) <A NAME=27475>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>probe-file</tt> is unaffected by
whether the first argument, if a stream, is open or closed. If the first
argument is a stream, <tt>probe-file</tt> behaves as if the function <tt>pathname</tt>
were applied to the stream and the resulting pathname used instead.
However, X3J13 further commented that the treatment of open streams
may differ considerably from one implementation to another; for example,
in some operating systems open files are written under a temporary or
invisible name and later renamed when closed.  In general, programmers writing
code intended to be portable should be very careful when using <tt>probe-file</tt>.

<tt>file-position <i>file-stream</i> &amp;optional <i>position</i></tt><P><tt>file-position</tt> returns or sets the current position within
a random-access file.
<P>
<tt>(file-position <i>file-stream</i>)</tt> returns a non-negative integer
indicating the current position within the <i>file-stream</i>, or <tt>nil</tt> if
this cannot be determined.  The file position at the start of a file will
be zero.  The value returned by <tt>file-position</tt> increases monotonically
as input or output operations are performed.  For a character file,
performing a single <tt>read-char</tt> or <tt>write-char</tt> operation
may cause the file position to be increased by more than 1 because of
character-set translations (such as translating between the Common Lisp
<tt>#\Newline</tt> character and an external ASCII
carriage-return/line-feed sequence) and other aspects of the
implementation.  For a binary file, every <tt>read-byte</tt> or <tt>write-byte</tt>
operation increases the file position by 1.
<P>
<tt>(file-position <i>file-stream</i> <i>position</i>)</tt> sets the position within
<i>file-stream</i> to be <i>position</i>.  The <i>position</i> may be an integer,
or <tt>:start</tt> for the beginning of the stream, or <tt>:end</tt> for the end of the
stream.
If the integer is too large or otherwise inappropriate, an error
is signaled (the <tt>file-length</tt> function returns the length beyond
which <tt>file-position</tt> may not access).  An integer returned by
<tt>file-position</tt> of one argument should, in general, be acceptable
as a second argument for use with the same file.
With two arguments,
<tt>file-position</tt> returns <tt>t</tt> if the repositioning was performed
successfully, or <tt>nil</tt> if it was not (for example,
because the file was not random-access).
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> Implementations that have character files represented
as a sequence of records of bounded size might choose to encode the
file position as, for example,
<i>record-number</i>*256+<i>character-within-record</i>.
This is a valid encoding because it increases monotonically as
each character is read or written, though not necessarily by 1 at
each step.  An integer might then be considered ``inappropriate''
as a second argument to <tt>file-position</tt> if, when decoded into
record number and character number, it turned out that the
specified record was too short for the specified character number.

<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>file-length <i>file-stream</i></tt><P><i>file-stream</i> must be a stream that is open to a file.
The length of the file is returned as a non-negative integer,
or <tt>nil</tt> if the length cannot be determined.
For a binary file,
the length is specifically
measured in units of the <tt>:element-type</tt> specified
when the file was opened (see <tt>open</tt>).

<tt>file-string-length <i>file-stream</i> <i>object</i></tt><P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=27566>&#160;</A>  to add
the function <tt>file-string-length</tt>.
The <i>object</i> must be a string or a character.  The function
<tt>file-string-length</tt> returns a non-negative integer
that is the difference between what the <tt>file-position</tt> of the
<i>file-stream</i> would be after and before writing the <i>object</i>
to the <i>file-stream</i>, or <tt>nil</tt> if this
difference cannot be determined.  The value returned may
depend on the current state of the <i>file-stream</i>; that is, calling
<tt>file-string-length</tt> on the same arguments twice may in certain circumstances
produce two different integers.
