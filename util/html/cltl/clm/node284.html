<A NAME=DeterminingtheEffectiveMethodSECTION>The</A>
effective method for a set of
arguments is determined by the following three-step procedure:
<P>
<OL><LI> Select the applicable methods.
<P>
<LI> Sort the applicable methods by precedence order, putting
the most specific method first.
<P>
<LI> Apply method combination to the sorted list of
applicable methods, producing the effective method.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<b>Selecting the Applicable Methods.</b>
This step is described in section <A HREF="node279.html#IntroductiontoMethodsSECTION">28.1.6.2</A>.
<P>
<b>Sorting the Applicable Methods by Precedence Order.</b>
To compare the precedence of two methods, their parameter specializers
are examined in order.  The default examination order is from left to
right, but an alternative order may be specified by the 
<tt>:argument-precedence-order</tt> option to <tt>defgeneric</tt> or to any of
the other forms that specify generic function options.
<P>
The corresponding parameter specializers from each method are
compared.  When a pair of parameter specializers are equal, the next
pair are compared for equality.  If all corresponding parameter
specializers are equal, the two methods must have different
qualifiers; in this case, either method can be selected to precede the
other.
<P>
If some corresponding parameter specializers are not equal, the first
pair of parameter specializers that are not equal determines the
precedence.  If both parameter specializers are classes, the more
specific of the two methods is the method whose parameter specializer
appears earlier in the class precedence list of the corresponding
argument.  Because of the way in which the set of applicable methods
is chosen, the parameter specializers are guaranteed to be present in
the class precedence list of the class of the argument.
<P>
If just one parameter specializer is <tt>(<tt>eql</tt> <i>object</i>)</tt>, the method with that parameter specializer precedes the
other method.  If both parameter specializers are <tt>eql</tt>
forms, the
specializers must be the same (otherwise the two methods would
not both have been applicable to this argument).
<P>
The resulting list of applicable methods has the most specific
method first and the least specific method last.
<P>
<b>Applying Method Combination to the Sorted List of Applicable Methods.</b>
In the simple case-if standard method combination is used and all
applicable methods are primary methods-the effective method is the
most specific method.  That method can call the next most specific
method by using the function <tt>call-next-method</tt>.  The method that
<tt>call-next-method</tt> will call is referred to as the <i>next
method</i>.  The predicate <tt>next-method-p</tt> tests whether a next
method exists.  If <tt>call-next-method</tt> is called and there is no
next most specific method, the generic function <tt>no-next-method</tt>
is invoked.
<P>
In general, the effective method is some combination of the applicable
methods.  It is defined by a Lisp form that contains calls to some or all
of the applicable methods, returns the value or values that will be
returned as the value or values of the generic function, and optionally
makes some of the methods accessible by means of <tt>call-next-method</tt>.
This Lisp form is the body of the effective method; it is augmented with
an appropriate lambda-list to make it a function.
<P>
The role of each method in the effective method is determined by its
method qualifiers and the specificity of the method.  A qualifier
serves to mark a method, and the meaning of a qualifier is
determined by the way that these marks are used by this step
of the procedure.  If an applicable method has an unrecognized
qualifier, this step signals an error and does not include that method
in the effective method.
<P>
When standard method combination is used together with qualified methods, 
the effective method is produced as described in
section <A HREF="node285.html#StandardMethodCombinationSECTION">28.1.7.2</A>.
<P>
Another type of method combination can be specified by using the 
<tt>:method-combination</tt> option of <tt>defgeneric</tt> or of any of the other
forms that specify generic function options.  In this way this step of
the procedure can be customized.
<P>
New types of method combination can be defined by using the 
<tt>define-method-combination</tt> macro.
<P>
The meta-object level also offers a mechanism for defining new types
of method combination.  The generic function 
<tt>compute-effective-method</tt> receives as arguments the generic function,
the method combination object, and the sorted list of applicable
methods.  It returns the Lisp form that defines the effective method.
A method for <tt>compute-effective-method</tt> can be defined directly by
using <tt>defmethod</tt> or indirectly by using 
<tt>define-method-combination</tt>.
A <i>method combination object</i> is an
object that encapsulates the method combination type and options
specified by the <tt>:method-combination</tt> option to forms that
specify generic function options.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> In the simplest implementation, the generic function would compute
the effective method each time it was called.  In practice, this will
be too inefficient for some implementations.  Instead, these
implementations might employ a variety of optimizations of the
three-step procedure. Some illustrative examples of such optimizations
are the following:
<P>
<UL><LI>  Use a hash table keyed by the class of the arguments to
store the effective method.
<P>
<LI>  Compile the effective method and save the resulting
compiled function in a table.
<P>
<LI>  Recognize the Lisp form as an instance of a pattern of
control structure and substitute a closure that implements
that structure.
<P>
<LI>  Examine the parameter specializers of all methods for the
generic function and enumerate all possible effective methods.
Combine the effective methods, together with code to select from
among them, into a single function and compile that function.  Call
that function whenever the generic function is called.
