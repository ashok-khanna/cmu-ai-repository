The lowest-level form that creates restart points is called <tt>restart-bind</tt>.
The <tt>restart-case</tt> macro is an abstraction that addresses many common needs for
<tt>restart-bind</tt> while offering a more
palatable syntax. See also 
<tt>with-simple-restart</tt>.
The function that transfers control to a restart
point established by one of these macros is called <tt>invoke-restart</tt>.
<P>
All restarts have dynamic extent; a restart does not survive execution of the form
that establishes it.

</pre>
<P>  This is shorthand for one of the most common uses of <tt>restart-case</tt>.
<P>
  If the restart designated by <i>name</i> is not invoked while executing the <i>form</i>s,
  all values returned by the last <i>form</i> are returned. If that
  restart is invoked, control is transferred to the <tt>with-simple-restart</tt>
  form, which immediately returns the two values <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>t</tt>.
<P>
  The <i>name</i> may be <tt>nil</tt>, in which case an anonymous restart
  is established.
<P>
  <tt>with-simple-restart</tt> could be defined by
<P><pre>
(defmacro with-simple-restart ((restart-name format-string 
                                &amp;rest format-arguments)

<b>Compatibility note:</b> In contrast to the way that Zetalisp has traditionally
  defined <tt>abort</tt> as a kind of condition to be handled,
  the Common Lisp Condition System defines <tt>abort</tt> as a
  way to restart (``proceed'' in Zetalisp terms).
<hr>
<b>Remark:</b> Some readers may wonder what ought to be done by the ``abort'' key (or whatever
    the implementation's interrupt key is-Control-C or Control-G, 
    for example). Such interrupts, whether synchronous or asynchronous
    in nature, are beyond the scope of this chapter and indeed are not currently
    addressed by Common Lisp at all. This may be a topic
    worth standardizing under separate cover. Here is some speculation
    about some possible things that might happen.
<P>
    An implementation might simply call <tt>abort</tt> or <tt>break</tt> directly
    without signaling any condition.
<P>
    Another implementation might signal some condition related to
    the fact that a key had been pressed rather than to the action that
    should be taken. This is one way to allow user customization.
    Perhaps there would be an implementation-dependent <tt>keyboard-interrupt</tt>
    condition type with a slot containing the key that was pressed-or
    perhaps there would be such a condition type, but rather than its having
    slots, different subtypes of that type with names like <tt>keyboard-abort</tt>,
    <tt>keyboard-break</tt>, and so on might be signaled. That implementation would
    then document the action it would take if user programs failed
    to handle the condition, and perhaps ways for user programs to
    usefully dismiss the interrupt.
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> Implementors are encouraged to make sure that there
  is always a restart named <tt>abort</tt> around any user code so that user code 
  can call <tt>abort</tt> at any time and expect something reasonable to happen;
  exactly what the reasonable thing is may vary somewhat. Typically, in an
  interactive program, invoking <tt>abort</tt> should return the user to top level,
  though in some batch or multi-processing situations
  killing the running process might be
  more appropriate.

<pre>
restart-case <em>expression</em> {(<i>case-name</i> <em>arglist</em>
                           {<i>keyword</i> <i>value</i>}*
                           {<i>form</i>}*)}*
</pre>
<P>  The <i>expression</i> is evaluated in a dynamic context where the clauses have 
  special meanings as points to which control may be transferred. If the <i>expression</i>
  finishes executing and returns any values, all such values are simply
  returned by the <tt>restart-case</tt> form. While the <i>expression</i> is running, any code may
  transfer control to one of the clauses (see <tt>invoke-restart</tt>). If a transfer
  occurs, the <i>form</i>s in the body of that clause will be evaluated and any values
  returned by the last such <i>form</i> will be returned by the <tt>restart-case</tt> form.
<P>
As a special case,
if the <i>expression</i> is a list whose <i>car</i> is <tt>signal</tt>, <tt>error</tt>,
     <tt>cerror</tt>, or <tt>warn</tt>, then <tt>with-condition-restarts</tt> is implicitly
     used to associate the restarts with the condition to be signaled.
For example,
<P><pre>
(restart-case (signal weird-error) 
  (become-confused ...) 
  (rewind-line-printer ...) 
  (halt-and-catch-fire ...))
</pre><P>
     is equivalent to
<P><pre>
(restart-case (with-condition-restarts 
                weird-error  
                (list (find-restart 'become-confused)  
                      (find-restart 'rewind-line-printer) 
                      (find-restart 'halt-and-catch-fire)) 
                (signal weird-error)) 
  (become-confused ...) 
  (rewind-line-printer ...) 
  (halt-and-catch-fire ...))
</pre><P>
<P>
  If there are no <i>form</i>s in a selected clause, <tt>restart-case</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
  The <i>case-name</i> may be <tt>nil</tt> or a symbol naming this restart.
<P>
  It is possible to have more than one clause use the same <i>case-name</i>.
  In this case, the first clause with that name will be found by
  <tt>find-restart</tt>. The other clauses are accessible using <tt>compute-restarts</tt>.
  [In this respect, <tt>restart-case</tt> is rather different from <tt>case</tt>!-GLS]
<P>
  Each <i>arglist</i> is a normal lambda-list containing parameters
  to be bound during the execution of 
  its corresponding <i>form</i>s. These parameters are used to pass any necessary 
  data from a call to <tt>invoke-restart</tt> to the <tt>restart-case</tt> clause.
<P>
  By default, <tt>invoke-restart-interactively</tt> will pass no arguments and
  all parameters must be optional in order to accommodate interactive
  restarting. However, the parameters need not be optional if the
  <tt>:interactive</tt> keyword has been used to inform <tt>invoke-restart-interactively</tt>
  about how to compute a proper argument list.
<P>
  The valid <i>keyword value</i> pairs are the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:test <i>fn</i></tt>
<DD>
<P>
    The <i>fn</i> must be a suitable argument for the <tt>function</tt> special form. The
    expression <tt>(function <i>fn</i>)</tt> will be evaluated in the current lexical
    environment. It should produce a function of one argument, a condition.
    If this function returns <tt>nil</tt> when given some condition, functions such as
<tt>find-restart</tt>, <tt>compute-restart</tt>, and <tt>invoke-restart</tt>
will not consider this restart when searching for restarts associated with
that condition.  If this pair is not supplied, it is as if
<P><pre>
(lambda (c) (declare (ignore c)) t)
</pre><P>
were used for the <i>fn</i>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:interactive <i>fn</i></tt>
<DD>
<P>
    The <i>fn</i> must be a suitable argument for the <tt>function</tt> special form. The
    expression <tt>(function <i>fn</i>)</tt> will be evaluated in the current lexical
    environment. It should produce a function of no arguments that 
    returns arguments to be used by <tt>invoke-restart-interactively</tt> when
    invoking this function. This function will be called in the dynamic
    environment available prior to any restart attempt. It may interact with the user
    on the stream in <tt>*query-io*</tt>.
<P>
    If a restart is invoked interactively but no <tt>:interactive</tt> option
    was supplied, the argument list used in the invocation is the empty
    list.
<P>
<DT><tt>:report <i>exp</i></tt>
<DD>
<P>
    If <i>exp</i> is not a literal string, it must be a suitable argument to the
    <tt>function</tt> special form. The expression <tt>(function <i>exp</i>)</tt> will be evaluated
    in the current lexical environment. It should produce a function of one
    argument, a stream, that prints on the stream a description of the
    restart. This function is called whenever the restart is printed while
    <tt>*print-escape*</tt> is <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
    If <i>exp</i> is a literal string, it is shorthand for
<P><pre>
(lambda (s) (write-string <i>exp</i> s))
</pre><P>
[That is, a function is provided that will simply write the given string literally
to the stream.-GLS]
<P>
    If a named restart is asked to report but no report information has been
    supplied, the name of the restart is used in generating default report text.
<P>
    When <tt>*print-escape*</tt> is <tt>nil</tt>, the printer will use the report information for
    a restart. For example, a debugger might announce the action of typing
    ``<tt>:continue</tt>'' by executing the equivalent of
<P><pre>
(format *debug-io* &quot;~&amp;~S - ~A~%&quot; ':continue some-restart)
</pre><P>
    which might then display as something like
<P><pre>
:CONTINUE - Return to command level.
</pre><P>
<P>
    It is an error if an unnamed restart is used and no report information
    is provided.
<P>
</dl>
<hr>
<b>Rationale:</b> Unnamed restarts are required to have report information
    on the grounds that they are generally only useful interactively,
    and an interactive option that has no description is of little value.
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> Implementations are encouraged to warn about this error at compilation time.
<P>
      At run time, this error might be noticed when entering
      the debugger. Since signaling an error would probably cause recursive
      entry into the debugger (causing yet another recursive error, and so on), it is
      suggested that the debugger print some indication of such problems when
      they occur, but not actually signal errors.
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Note that 
<P><pre>
(restart-case <i>expression</i> 
  (<i>name1</i> <i>arglist1</i> <i>options1</i> . <i>body1</i>) 
  (<i>name2</i> <i>arglist2</i> <i>options2</i> . <i>body2</i>) 
  ...)
</pre><P>
is essentially equivalent to
<P><pre>
(block #1=#:block-1 
  (let ((#2=#:var-2 nil)) 
    (tagbody 
      (restart-bind ((<i>name1</i> #'(lambda (&amp;rest temp)

		    (go #3=#:tag-3)) 
		<b><</b>slightly transformed <i>options1</i><b>></b>)
                     (<i>name2</i> #'(lambda (&amp;rest temp) 
		    (setq #2# temp) 
		    (go #4=#:tag-4)) 
		<b><</b>slightly transformed <i>options2</i><b>></b>)
                     ...) 
        (return-from #1# expression)) 
      #3# (return-from #1#

                (apply #'(lambda <i>arglist2</i> . <i>body2</i>) #2#)) 
      ...)))
</pre><P>
[Note the use of ``gensyms'' such as <tt>#:block-1</tt> as block names,
variables, and <tt>tagbody</tt> tags in this example,
and the use of <tt>#<i>n</i>=</tt> and <tt>#<i>n</i>#</tt> read-macro syntax
to indicate that the very same gensym appears in multiple places.-GLS]
<P>
Here are some examples of the use of <tt>restart-case</tt>.
<P><pre>
(loop 
  (restart-case (return (apply function some-args)) 
    (new-function (new-function) 
        :report &quot;Use a different function.&quot; 
        :interactive 
          (lambda () 
            (list (prompt-for 'function &quot;Function: &quot;))) 
      (setq function new-function)))) 

(loop 
  (restart-case (return (apply function some-args)) 
    (nil (new-function) 
        :report &quot;Use a different function.&quot; 
        :interactive 
          (lambda () 
            (list (prompt-for 'function &quot;Function: &quot;))) 
      (setq function new-function)))) 

(restart-case (a-command-loop) 
  (return-from-command-level () 
      :report 
        (lambda (s)     ;Argument <tt>s</tt> is a stream 
          (format s &quot;Return from command level ~D.&quot; level)) 
    nil)) 

(loop  
  (restart-case (another-random-computation) 
    (continue () nil)))
</pre><P>
  The first and second examples are equivalent from the point of view of someone
  using the interactive debugger, but they differ in one important aspect for 
  non-interactive handling. If a handler ``knows about'' named restarts, as in, for example,
<P><pre>
(when (find-restart 'new-function) 
  (invoke-restart 'new-function the-replacement))
</pre><P>
  then only the first example, and not the second, will have control
  transferred to its correction clause, since only the first example uses
  a restart named <tt>new-function</tt>.
<P>
Here is a more complete example:
<P><pre>
(let ((my-food 'milk) 
      (my-color 'greenish-blue)) 
  (do () 
      ((not (bad-food-color-p my-food my-color))) 
    (restart-case (error 'bad-food-color 
                         :food my-food :color my-color) 
      (use-food (new-food) 
          :report &quot;Use another food.&quot; 
        (setq my-food new-food)) 
      (use-color (new-color) 
          :report &quot;Use another color.&quot; 
        (setq my-color new-color)))) 
  ;; We won't get to here until MY-FOOD 
  ;; and MY-COLOR are compatible. 
  (list my-food my-color))
</pre><P>
Assuming that <tt>use-food</tt> and <tt>use-color</tt> have been defined as
<P><pre>
(defun use-food (new-food) 
  (invoke-restart 'use-food new-food)) 

(defun use-color (new-color) 
  (invoke-restart 'use-color new-color))
</pre><P>
a handler can then restart from the error in either of two ways.
It may correct the color or correct the food. For example:
<P><pre>
#'(lambda (c) ... (use-color 'white) ...)   ;Corrects <tt>color</tt> 

#'(lambda (c) ... (use-food 'cheese) ...)   ;Corrects <tt>food</tt>
</pre><P>
<P>
  Here is an example using <tt>handler-bind</tt> and <tt>restart-case</tt> that refers to a
  condition type <tt>foo-error</tt>, presumably defined elsewhere:
<P><pre>
(handler-bind ((foo-error #'(lambda (ignore) (use-value 7)))) 
  (restart-case (error 'foo-error) 
    (use-value (x) (* x x)))) 
 => 49

  If invoked, this function may either perform a non-local transfer of control
