<H1>Structure of the Repository</H1>

The main directories of the AI Repository are as follows:
<listing>
  readme.txt    This file.
  ls-Rla.gz     The results of doing ls -Rla on the repository.
  areas/        AI software and other materials organized according 
		to topic or field. 
  copying/      Copies of the GNU GPL and various other copyright
		notices.
  doc/          Information related to ftp sites, bitftp,
		ftpmail, etc.
  events/       Calendar of events, including conferences,
		workshops, and other meetings and announcements. 
  file_ext.txt  File extensions in use in the repository.
  html/         Mosaic-related documents, FAQ files, etc.
  lang/         Programming language implementations, including
		Lisp, Scheme, and Prolog.

</listing>

The repository has standardized on using <tt>tar</tt> for producing archives
of files and <tt>gzip</tt> for compression. For example, shell archives have
been replaced with tar files, and compressed files (<tt>.Z</tt>) recompressed
using GZIP (<tt>.gz</tt>). GZIP uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm (LZ77), and
generally achieves better compression than LZW (<tt>compress</tt>), Huffman
coding (<tt>pack</tt>) and adaptive Huffman coding <br>(<tt>compact</tt>), and 
is patent
free. Implementations exist for VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Atari, Unix, and
Macintosh; see the <tt>util/</tt> directory for copies of the sources.
<P>
Packages that are intended solely for use on a PC or Macintosh may be
archived using the formats common on those machines, such as <tt>zip</tt>,
<tt>sit</tt>, <tt>cpt</tt>, and <tt>hqx</tt>. The <tt>util/</tt> directory
contains tools for manipulating these files on other systems.
<P>
Due to its size, the repository is split among several disk
partitions. So cding to a directory may actually move you to a
different partition. Nevertheless, each partition mimics the entire
directory structure, so that
<PRE>
   cd .. 
</PRE>
will actually work as expected.
<P>
Further information on a package, such as a description of the contents, 
mailing lists, E-mail 
addresses for bug reports, and so on, will be included in a file named
<tt>0.doc</tt> in the package's directory.
