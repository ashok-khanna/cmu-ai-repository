<H1>Contributing Files to the Repository</H1>

For a program to be included in the Repository, it must be <em>freely
distributable</em>. The author(s) may retain a copyright on the programs,
but must allow anybody to copy and use the files without charge. If
the author(s) later decide to commercialize the program, the version
included in the Repository will remain available for free.
<P>
Programs that have been placed in the public domain (e.g., by the
author publicly announcing "I place this program in the public
domain") may also be included in the repository, since by placing a
program in the public domain, the author has given up all rights to
the program.
<P>
A package must, in general, include the source code in the distribution
for us to consider adding it to the repository. 
<P>
If you would like to contribute a program or other files to the
Repository, send a message to <I>AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu</I> giving
us permission to include the file in the repository (and also on the
AI CD-ROM, if that is acceptable to you). Files may be placed in
<PRE>
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/   [128.2.206.173] 
</PRE>
and should include a <tt>0.doc</tt> file. An example <tt>0.doc</tt>
file can be found in this directory. If you don't want to write your
own <tt>0.doc</tt> file, we can write one for you, provided you give
us the necessary information somewhere in your package.
<P>
All contributions must also be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright
statement -- either a declaration by the author that the materials are
in the public domain, that the materials are subject to the GNU
General Public License (cite GPL version), or that the materials are
subject to copyright, but the copyright holder grants permission for
free use, copying, and distribution. Inclusion of materials in the
repository does not modify the author's rights to the work in any way.
(If your copyright notice is too restrictive for us to include the
files in the repository, we'll let you know.)
