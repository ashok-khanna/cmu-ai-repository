<H1>Retrieving Files by FTP and AFS</H1>

The AI Repository is kept in the Andrew File System (AFS) directory 
<PRE>
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/
</PRE>
and its subdirectories. Files may be retrieved using either AFS or
anonymous FTP.
<P>
If your site runs AFS, you can just cd to this directory and copy the
files directly. Many schools, laboratories and corporations now run
AFS.  Further information about AFS can be obtained by sending email
to <i>afs-sales@transarc.com</i>.
<P>
If your site does not run AFS, you can still get the files by
anonymous ftp from
<PRE>
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/   [128.2.206.173] 
</PRE>
Use username <tt>anonymous</tt> and typing your email
address (in the form <tt>user@host</tt>) as the password. 
<P>
(If you try to cd to the <tt>/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/</tt>
directory while connected via anonymous FTP, you must <tt>cd</tt> in one atomic
operation, as the CMU security mechanisms prevent access to superior
directories from an anonymous ftp. If you use the <tt>/user/ai/</tt> alias you
won't have any problems.)
<P>
The following is an example of using ftp to retrieve the software:
<PRE>
   % ftp ftp.cs.cmu.edu
   Connected to MULBERRY.SRV.CS.CMU.EDU.
   220 MULBERRY.SRV.CS.CMU.EDU FTP server (Version 4.105 of 10-Jul-90 12:07) \

</PRE>
If you will be transfering compressed (gzipped) files, be sure to type
the <tt>binary</tt> command before retrieving the files. The <tt>get</tt> command is
used to get a single file, and <tt>mget</tt> to retrieve multiple files using
wildcards.  If you're using the <tt>mget</tt> command, you might want to turn
off prompting first by using the <tt>prompt</tt> command.
