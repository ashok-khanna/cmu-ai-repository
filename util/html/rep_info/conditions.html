<LI> <H3>LACK OF WARRANTY.</H3> This software is made available "AS IS" and is
   distributed without warranties of any kind, either expressed or
   implied, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
   merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. No warranty is
   made about the software or its performance.
   <P>
   Carnegie Mellon University and the repository maintainer(s) do not
   accept any responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using
   materials from the repository or for whether such materials serve any
   particular purpose or work at all.
   <P>
   In no event will Carnegie Mellon University or the repository
   maintainer(s) be liable to you for damages, including lost profits,
   lost monies, lost revenue, or other special, incidental,
   consequential, indirect or punitive damages arising out of or in
   connection with the use or inability to use the software (including
   but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or
   losses sustained by third parties or a failure of the program to
   operate as documented), even if we have been advised of the
   possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party,
   whether in an action of contract, negligence, or other tortious action.
   <P>
   Carnegie Mellon University and the repository maintainer(s) are under
   no obligation to provide any services, by way of maintenance, update,
   or otherwise.
   <P>
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not constitute an
   endorsement or recommendation of the materials and shall not be
   interpreted as such. 
   <P>
<LI> <H3>EXPERIMENTAL NATURE OF THE MATERIALS.</H3> The materials included 
   in the 
   repository are to be considered experimental in nature. You assume any
   and all risk involved in using the software and agree to indemnify
   Carnegie Mellon University and the repository maintainer(s) against
   any and all actions arising from its use.
   <P>
   USE OF THIS MATERIAL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
   We specifically deny any responsibility for the accuracy
   or quality of information contained in this distribution.
   We do not warrant the accuracy of the information provided.
   We do not warrant that the software, documentation,
   or the information provided will satisfy your requirements,
   or that the software and documentation are without defect or error,
   or that the operation of the software will be uninterrupted.
   <P>
   By retrieving files from the repository and/or using the software (or
   authorizing any other person to do so) you signify your acceptance of
   these conditions.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, DO NOT
   RETRIEVE FILES FROM THE REPOSITORY.
   <P>
<LI> <H3>FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE and FREE USAGE.</H3> Use and copying of the
   software and the preparation of derivative works based on this
   software are permitted, subject to the author's terms and conditions.
   Public domain software and software covered by
   the <A HREF="../../copying/gpl/gpl_2_0.txt">GNU General Public License</A>
   automatically meet this definition. (To
   save space, a single copy of the GNU GPL has been placed in the file
   <A HREF="../../copying/gpl/gpl_2_0.txt"><tt>copying/gpl/gpl_2_0.txt</tt></A>.)
   <P>
   Copyrighted software will be included if and only if the author(s)
   agree to let the software be distributed and used without fee. The
   authors of copyrighted software may place certain other restrictions
   on the software, such as restrictions against the commercialization of
   the software. See the following section for details.
   <P>
<LI> <h3>OTHER CONDITIONS.</h3> Some of the software packages included in the
   repository contain additional restrictions on their use. Conditions
   specific to a particular program or system will be included in a file
   named <tt>LICENSE</tt>, <tt>COPYING</tt>, <tt>COPYRIGHT</tt>,
   <tt>README</tt> or something similar (e.g.,
   as a comment at the top of the source code files) in the 
   tar file containing the program. You agree to adhere to these
   conditions.  Any copyright notice or file must be left intact and
   included with any copy of the software or materials.
   <P>
   In particular, some packages may contain restrictions against the
   commercialization of the software. Separate licensing is often
   available for companies wishing to commercialize the software or to
   incorporate the software into a commercial product. Contact the
   author(s) for details.
   <P>
   Other packages may go one step further, and restrict the software
   license to non-commercial (education, research, and personal use)
   purposes. There is an important difference between "restrictions on
   commercialization" and "prohibition of commercial use". If you just
   want to prevent folks from selling your program or incorporating it
   into a commercial product, we recommend using the former.
   <P>
   There may be other conditions, such restrictions against
   non-military use, restrictions against use in nuclear power plants
   or other safety-critical applications, and so on. Read the
   copyright notices in the packages for details.
   <P>
   If we feel that an author's conditions unduly restrict the ability to
   distribute, use, and modify the software, we will not include it in
   the repository. The file 
   <A HREF="../../copying/non_gpl/template.txt"><tt>copying/non_gpl/template.txt</tt></A>
   contains a template for an
   acceptable copyright notice (the file 
   <A HREF="../../copying/gpl/gpl_2_0.txt"><tt>gpl_2_0.txt</tt></A> is also acceptable).
   <P>
<LI><h3>COURTESIES.</h3> Producing free software takes time, effort, and 
   money.
   There are certain courtesies that the authors request, and we
   strongly urge you to adhere to:
   <P>
   <UL>
   <LI>  If requested by the author(s), send a short E-mail note to
         them if you're actively using the software. Provide details
         if you have made any noteworthy uses of the material. This
         helps satisfy their curiousity, and can also help them
         justify their research to funders (or tenure committees).
   <P>
   <LI>  Sending changes, bug-fixes, and improvements to the author(s)
         to let them incorporate them into the original. This helps
         prevent the creation of many similar but divergement
         versions. Some authors ask that changes to the software be
         clearly documented in a change log.
   <P>
   <LI>  All materials developed as a consequence of the use of the
         software or other materials shall duly acknowledge such use,
         in accordance with the usual standards of acknowledging
         credit in academic research. 
   </UL>
<P>

   Permission is expressly granted for major sections of the
   repository to be made available for file transfer (mirrored) from

   <P>
   The purpose of this copyright notice is to
   <UL>
      <LI> ensure that sales of any CD-ROMs containing the AI Repository 
          in whole or in significant part contribute to the expansion of 
          the repository, and
   <P>
      <LI> ensure that any for-profit publication of the repository adheres
          to the copyright restrictions placed on the individual files 
          by their authors/owners.
