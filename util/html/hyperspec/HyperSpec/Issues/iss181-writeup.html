<B>Edit history:</B>   22-Aug-91, Version 1 by Barmar<P>
                10-Sep-91, Version 2 by Barmar - minor RPG-suggested<P>
                           changes<P>
                10-Jan-92, Version 3 by Barrett - remove <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_generic-function.html#generic-function"><B>GENERIC-FUNCTION</B></A>,<P>
                           per X3J13 ammendment<P>
                10-Feb-92, Version 4 by Barrett - put back <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_generic-function.html#generic-function"><B>GENERIC-FUNCTION</B></A><P>
                           symbol mistakenly removed; fix Current practice<P>
<P>
<B>Problem description:<P>
</B><P>
  Very few, if any, CLOS implemementations implement GENERIC-FLET and<P>
  GENERIC-LABELS.<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal (GENERIC-FLET-POORLY-DESIGNED:DELETE):<P>
</B><P>
  Remove the operators GENERIC-FLET, GENERIC-LABELS, and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_generic-function.html#generic-function"><B>GENERIC-FUNCTION</B></A> from<P>
  the language.  Delete the symbols GENERIC-FLET and GENERIC-LABELS from the<P>
  COMMON-LISP package.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
  The current form of lexical generic functiona is inadequate for<P>
  general use, and therefore there is no existing compelling reason to<P>
  retain them. Because they are poorly designed, it would be better to<P>
  remove them from the language hoping for research and better designs<P>
  than to prejudice the case for them by retaining a bad design.<P>
<P>
  The symbol <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_generic-function.html#generic-function"><B>GENERIC-FUNCTION</B></A> is retained because it also names a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_class.html#class"><B>class</B></A>.<P>
<P>
<B>Current practice:<P>
</B><P>
  Apple Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0 provides the listed operators.<P>
<P>
  Lucid CL 4.0 and Symbolics Genera 8.1 both <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>export</B></A> GENERIC-FLET and<P>
  GENERIC-LABELS from their CLOS packages, and Lucid imports it into<P>
  the implementation-dependent package that USER inherits from.  Neither<P>
  of them defines them, though.<P>
<P>
  Preliminary Symbolics Genera 8.2 and Chesnut Lisp-to-C Translator 2.0<P>
  provided the listed operators at the time of the December meeting.  Since<P>
  then they have deleted from both implementations, in deference to the<P>
  committee's decision.<P>
<P>
  Symbolics CLOE does not <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> them.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
  Very little.  For many implementors, no work at all is involved.<P>
  Any implementors that <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_export.html#export"><B>export</B></A> these symbols from COMMON-LISP will have<P>
  to change their package specification, but that's it.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
  Since this is a new feature that not everyone implements, programs<P>
  that use them are not currently portable, so there should be little<P>
  effect on users.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of non-adoption:<P>
</B><P>
  It will probably take longer for complete CLOS implementations to<P>
  appear.<P>
<P>
<B>Performance impact:<P>
</B><P>
  None.<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
  See Esthetics and Cost of non-adoption.<P>
<P>
<B>Esthetics:<P>
</B><P>
  Since no one really understands what these special forms are for, this<P>
  clearly simplifies the language.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
  From RPG:<P>
<P>
    The reason that lexical generic functions are relatively less useful<P>
    than lexical functions is that with a generic function you are<P>
    expecting that someone will extend it when they extend the ontology of<P>
    the world, and you want to get a hold of those extensions for free.<P>
    The mechanism for the for-freeness is the global namespace for generic<P>
    function names. When you make those names lexical you lose this<P>
    feature. Presumably this is the primary nice feature of OOP.<P>
    <P>
    The use of lexical generic functions is to create private operations<P>
    within a scope, which can be larger than the scope of a function. The<P>
    purpose of generic-flet/labels is to allow folks to write these<P>
    private functions. The point of <A HREF="iss360.html">with-added-methods</A> was to allow these<P>
    local functions to be extended within the larger lexical scope. <P>
    <P>
    <A HREF="iss360.html">With-added-methods</A> had the flaw that it did not allow one to extend a<P>
    global generic function within its dynamic extent, which I believe was<P>
    the intent of its proposer. That is, it couldn't be used to add a<P>
    <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_method.html#method"><B>method</B></A> to a generic version of print such that that extended version<P>
    would be used by all free references to it dynamically within the<P>
    extent of the <A HREF="iss360.html">with-added-methods</A>.<P>
    <P>
    Still, it had a use within the scenario I outlined above.<P>
    <P>
    The real flaw with the whole design is that one would like to have<P>
    lexical <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/syscla_class.html#class"><B>class</B></A> definitions, which would render lexical generic<P>
    functions more useful, because then the lexical environments <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> a<P>
    possible worlds mechanism. So, one would like to create an environment<P>
    with a locally extended hierarchy within which the lexical generic<P>
    functions are used.<P>
    <P>
    A minor flaw with lexical generic functions are specified is their<P>
    stupid syntax. If I were in a catty mood, I would ascribe the bad<P>
    syntax.<P>
    <P>
    I believe there are a number of other operations one would like to<P>
    perform with generic functions that are now not possible, such as<P>
    explicitly combining separately defined generic functions. This along<P>
    with lexical generic functions would allow people to do<P>
    encapsulation.  But that's another story.<P>
    <P>
    Right now I would advocate removing lexical generic functions so that<P>
    someone can do a proper design.<P>
<P>
  Barmar:<P>
<P>
    What about GENERIC-FUNCTION?  If lexical generic functions are<P>
    useless, maybe anonymous ones are as well.<P>
