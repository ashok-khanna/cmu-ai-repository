<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
The currently proposed error system contains names for three conditions<P>
related to floating-point operations: <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_nt-underflow.html#floating-point-underflow"><B>floating-point-underflow</B></A>,<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_int-overflow.html#floating-point-overflow"><B>floating-point-overflow</B></A>, and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_division-by-zero.html#division-by-zero"><B>division-by-zero</B></A>.  Probably a majority<P>
of implementation will be running on machines that support the IEEE<P>
floating point standard; but there is no name for the remaining two out <P>
of the five mandated trapping conditions, namely <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_oint-inexact.html#floating-point-inexact"><B>floating-point-inexact</B></A><P>
and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_id-operation.html#floating-point-invalid-operation"><B>floating-point-invalid-operation</B></A>.<P>
<P>
Furthermore, even though the condition names may appear in an image,<P>
it is not clear that such traps are enabled at every point in time.<P>
The IEEE <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A> specifies that user-level programs ought to have<P>
the capability of selectively enabling or disabling its five traps;<P>
and other implementations may run on a variety of hardware configurations<P>
for which the traps possible vary from host to host.  However, there is<P>
no current way for user-code to ask (1) what conditions are in fact<P>
supporting floating-point traps, nor to ask (2) just what traps are <P>
currently active<P>
<P>
Note that some very simple implementations might not be able to cause<P>
trapping even for floating-point-underflow;  and in other implementations,<P>
the relevant traps may vary on a host-to-host basic, depending on what<P>
particular optional hardware is available on that host.  For example,<P>
Sun3 workstations come  in three configurations: one with only software <P>
floating-point support, one with a Motorola MC68881 attached co-processor, <P>
and one with both an MC68881 and a Weitek Floating Point &quot;Accelerator&quot;; <P>
the increasing hardware complement gives rise to an increasing number of <P>
implementation-specific traps.  Even within the IEEE <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A>, it is <P>
possible for a conforming implementation to make a refinement of the five <P>
suggested traps [the MC68881 partitions one of the traps into three, <P>
giving a total of eight]; so even though one knows that an implementation <P>
is IEEE compatible, it still makes sense to ask what conditions are <P>
supportable as floating-point traps.<P>
<P>
Proposal (<A HREF="iss163.html">FLOATING-POINT-CONDITION-NAMES:X3J13-NOV-89</A>)<P>
<P>
  1. Add <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_id-operation.html#floating-point-invalid-operation"><B>FLOATING-POINT-INVALID-OPERATION</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_oint-inexact.html#floating-point-inexact"><B>FLOATING-POINT-INEXACT</B></A><P>
     as conditions which are sub-conditions of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_arithmetic-error.html#arithmetic-error"><B>ARITHMETIC-ERROR</B></A>.<P>
<P>
The intent is that if condition FOO is a currently enabled floating<P>
point trap, then whenever that particular situation arises the<P>
system will arrange to signal the Lisp condition FOO.  The means for<P>
enabling and disabling traps is not addressed in this proposal.<P>
<P>
Proposal (FLOATING-POINT-CONDITION-NAMES:ADD-MINIMAL-IEEE)<P>
<P>
  1. Add <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_id-operation.html#floating-point-invalid-operation"><B>FLOATING-POINT-INVALID-OPERATION</B></A> and <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_floati_oint-inexact.html#floating-point-inexact"><B>FLOATING-POINT-INEXACT</B></A><P>
     as conditions which are sub-conditions of <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/contyp_arithmetic-error.html#arithmetic-error"><B>ARITHMETIC-ERROR</B></A>.<P>
  2. Add a global parameter SUPPORTED-FLOATING-POINT-CONDITIONS which<P>
     is to contain a list of all the condition names that can, in that<P>
     implementation, be enabled as floating-point traps; this is to<P>
     be an &quot;implementation revealing&quot; parameter.<P>
  3. Add a function of no arguments ENABLED-FLOATING-POINT-TRAPS which<P>
     returns a list of condition names for all currently enabled<P>
     floating point trapping conditions.<P>
<P>
The intent is that if condition FOO is a currently enabled floating<P>
point trap, then whenever that particular situation arises the<P>
system will arrange to signal the Lisp condition FOO.  The means for<P>
enabling and disabling traps is not addressed in this proposal.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
Many Common Lisp implementations do in fact run on hardware that<P>
supports the IEEE floating-point standard;  a minimal requirement<P>
for porting between these implementations is that they all use the<P>
same name for the five IEEE-mandated floating-point conditions.<P>
Since at least some implementations will <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> means for selective<P>
enabling and disabling of various floating-point traps, then the <P>
user must be able to query the system to find out what the current<P>
state is, and what states are supportable.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
Lucid Common Lisp supports this much; moreover, it uses <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_setf.html#setf"><B>SETF</B></A> on<P>
(ENABLED-FLOATING-POINT-TRAPS) as the primary means to alter the<P>
currently-enabled traps.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to implementors:<P>
</B><P>
Trivial.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to users:<P>
</B><P>
None; this is an upward-compatible addition.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
Portability of a greater amount of user code; portability of &quot;skills&quot;,<P>
since IEEE support is so common.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
It is better for all IEEE implementations to use the same names for<P>
these conditions, rather than have them vary from one to another.<P>
It is also probably better for non-IEEE implementations to use the<P>
IEEE condition names where appropriate, just to minimize the <P>
conceptual overload.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
If an implementation is to claim full IEEE support, then it ought to <P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> some means of enabling and catching these five IEEE-mandated<P>
traps.  Then it would be appropriate to put :IEEE-FLOATING-POINT on<P>
the list <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/var_stfeaturesst.html#STfeaturesST"><B>*FEATURES*</B></A> (see CLtL, P.448).<P>
<P>
Moon and JonL privately discussed some means for enabling and<P>
disabling various floating-point traps, back in June 1989 when the <P>
<A HREF="iss162.html">float-underflow</A> proposal was under discussion; they came to the <P>
conclusion that &quot;getting the design right and efficient&quot; was more <P>
than a few minutes worth of work, and so postponed further work on it.<P>
<P>
<P>
[The IEEE <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A> apparently goes by the name of ANSI-IEEE Std 754-1985; <P>
my working copy is Draft 10.0 from 1982.  I don't think there are great <P>
variances between them. -- JonL --]<P>
