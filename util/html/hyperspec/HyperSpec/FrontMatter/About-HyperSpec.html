<A NAME="Abstract"><H2>Abstract</H2></A>

Lisp is a family of languages with a long history.
Early key ideas in Lisp were developed by 
<A HREF="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/">John McCarthy</A>
in 1956.  
Many important dialects, languages and embedded systems 
have emerged from this work.<P>

In 1981, representatives of several major dialects began to pool their
efforts to design 
<A REL=TOP HREF="index-2.html">Common Lisp</A>,
an `industrial strength' dialect of
Lisp that would provide stability for commercial applications.<P>

The initial design of Common Lisp was well received, and in 1986 
<A HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/x3j13.html">X3J13</A>
was formed to transform this work into a formal standard.
The resulting design, 
<A REL=CITATION HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/tc_sd4/x3j13sd4.html"
>X3.226-1994</A>,
is a standard for Common Lisp--<IT>not</IT> for the entire Lisp family.<P>

The Common Lisp standard improves on earlier Common Lisp
work by 
<A HREF="X3J13-Issues.html">
placing much greater emphasis on portability,
clarifying many aspects of compilation semantics</A>,
and adding several major pieces of
new functionality: 
<A HREF="../Body/chap-7.html">an object-oriented programming system</A>,
<A HREF="../Body/chap-9.html">a condition handling system</A>,
<A HREF="../Body/sec_6-1.html">an improved iteration facility</A>,
and 
<A HREF="../Body/chap-13.html">better support for large character sets</A>.<P>
