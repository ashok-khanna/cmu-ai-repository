<H1>[1-1] Sources of Information about Prolog</H1>
<PRE>
The newsgroups comp.lang.prolog, comp.object.logic, and (to a lesser
extent) comp.ai are a source of information and discussion about Prolog. 
See also sci.logic. The newsgroup comp.constraints is for information
about constraint processing languages and related topics. 

A "Frequently Asked Questions" posting is posted to comp.lang.prolog
twice a month by Jamie Andrews &#60;jamie@cs.sfu.ca&#62;. The Prolog FAQ and this
Prolog Resource Guide are intended to complement one another.

Several WWW resources are available (see also [1-5] and [1-15]):

   FAQs, newsgroup postings, tech reports, and more.  The URL is:
