<H1>[1-8] The Prolog 1000 Database</H1>
<PRE>
The Prolog 1000 is a database of real Prolog applications being
assembled in conjunction with the Association for Logic Programming
(ALP) and PVG. The aim is to demonstrate how Prolog is being used in
the real world and it already contains over 500 programs with a total
of well over 2 million lines of code. The database is available for
research use in SGML format from the Imperial College archive

If you have or know about a program that might qualify for inclusion,
send an email message to Al Roth (alroth@cix.compulink.co.uk) for an
