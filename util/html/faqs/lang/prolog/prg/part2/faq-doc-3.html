AAIS Full Control Prolog (version 3.1.3) is an Edinburgh-standard
compiler and interpreter that runs on all Apple 680x0 Macintosh computers
(from Plus through Quadras and Powerbooks). It runs under System 6
and 7 (or A/UX 3.0), requiring 4mb RAM, and is 32-bit clean.  It
is built on an object-oriented kernel, includes many object-oriented 
extensions to the language, functions for constructing graphical user 
interfaces, direct program access to the printer for printing text or 
graphics, and full support for Apple Events. There are also numerous 
example programs, including source code for the AAIS Full Control 
Prolog's own standard development interface, and how to interface with
Oracle databases and FileMaker Pro databses.  AAIS Full Control Prolog 
costs $495. For an additional $199 (and a signed license), you can get a
copy of AAIS Prolog Program Creator, an application generator/runtime
distribution system that turns Prolog programs into Macintosh
applications. For more information, write to Advanced AI Systems,
Inc., PO Box 39-0360, Mountain View, CA 94039-0360, call 415-948-8658,
fax 415-948-2486, or email AAISProlog@aol.com. Earlier version (2.0) 
reviewed in AI Expert, Feburary 1991.
   [NOTE: Douglas Lanam, President of Advanced AI Systems, Inc.,
   announced on April 1, 1994, that he would be ceasing all future
   development of the product due to economic and personal reasons. The
   remaining stock of AAIS Full Control Prolog and the Program Creator is
   being offered on an as-is basis with no return for $99 a copy. You
   can order copies by phone using your credit card.
   Technical support through phone, mail, and email is continuing, but
   they cannot return phone calls or faxes outside North America, so
   those replies would be sent by email or snail mail.]

ProLog by BIM is a high-performance and robust implementation of the
Prolog language. It compiles to native machine code for maximum
execution speed, and provides flexible memory management with automated
expansion, shrinking, garbage collection and user-definable parameters.
The ProLog by BIM environment comprises a GUI including an execution
monitor and debugger, an on-line help facility, a extended emacs
interface and a profiler. ProLog by BIM also includes a bi-directional
external language interface, which is used for the included interfaces
to graphics, windowing and RDBMS packages. The system also comes with a
large library of Prolog source code which contains many of the most
commonly used predicates.  Stand-alone run-times without royalties and
embeddability allow problem-free end-user delivery.  ProLog by BIM comes
with Carmen, a WYSIWYG GUI-Generator delivering Prolog code that allows
notifiers and call-backs in Prolog and serves as a powerful
rapid-prototyping aid.  ProLog by BIM runs on SPARC, INTEL PC running
Solaris 2.x, HP700 and IBM RS/6000. BIM provides both training and
consultancy on Prolog and Prolog based developments efforts.  For more
information write to BIM Engineering Europe sa/nv, ProLog by BIM dept., 
avenue A. Einstein 4, B - 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium,

EDCAAD C-Prolog is a prolog interpreter for Sun (SunOS), VAX (Ultrix,
VMS), Apollo, and 68000 (Unix). An inexpensive academic license is
available. It is an interpreter-based system, and hence is slower than
WAM-based Prologs. It is implemented in C, and should run on almost
any 32-bit machine with a C compiler. For more information, write to 
EdCAAD, Department of Architecture, Edinburgh University, 20 Chambers St.,

FRIL (Fuzzy Relational Inference Language) is a logic-programming
language that incorporates a consistent method for handling
uncertainty, based on Baldwin's theories of support logic, mass
assignments, and evidential reasoning. Mass assignments give a
consistent way of manipulating fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainties,
enabling different forms of uncertainty to be integrated within a
single framework. Fril has a list-based syntax, similar to the early
micro-Prolog from LPA. Prolog is a special case of Fril, in which
programs involve no uncertainty. Fril runs on Unix, Macintosh, MS-DOS,
and Windows 3.1 platforms. For further information, write to Dr B.W.
Pilsworth, Fril Systems Ltd, Bristol Business Centre, Maggs House, 78
Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1QX, UK. A longer description is available as

GT-Prolog is a high performance implementation of Edinburgh-standard
Prolog for the Commodore Amiga. GT-Prolog includes the ProBench
interactive development environment supporting incremental compilation,
a multi-port debugger based on the Byrd model, a source code editor, and
a break facility. GT-Prolog provides transparent access to sophisticated
optimization techniques including Tail Recursion Optimisation, First
Argument Indexing/Hashing, In-line Arithmetic Evaluation and automatic
Garbage Collection of code and data. Error handling is based on catch
and throw mechanisms. GT-Prolog is also one of the first implementations
to support a fully logical Prolog database.  GT-Prolog provides explicit
control of memory allocation allowing programs to use up to 16mb for
data and 4gb for code and requires a minimum configuration of 1Mb memory
plus Workbench version 2 or later.  GT-Prolog includes a library of more
than 120 predicates that provide user programs with access to the
facilities of AmigaDOS. The single user price is 89.95 pounds sterling
inclusive of VAT and postage/packing. For more information, write to
Graham Thwaites, Grange Technology Limited, Stream Road, Upton, Didcot,

SNI Prolog Version 3 is an implementation of the Prolog language that
is compatible with the ISO Standard draft. It is available from
Siemens Nixdorf for Unix workstations for about DM 11100 in Germany.
SNI Prolog runs on the SGI, SNI and Sun platforms, and ports to other
systems, including MS-DOS, are in progress. Includes coroutines,
finite domains, numerical and boolean constraints, garbage collection,
incremental compilation, dynamic linking, hypertext style on-line
help, a window environment with an integrated editor, interfaces to
INFORMIX, Motif/XWindows and C. The constraint programming features of
SNI Prolog provide support for solving problems from operations
research such as dynamic resource allocation and flexible scheduling
with numerical constraints or the verification of complex systems with
Boolean constraints. For more information, write to Siemens Nixdorf

Turbo Prolog. See PDC Prolog.

Visual Prolog. Developed as the multi-target GUI based successor to
PDC Prolog (described above). The Standard version generates source
code compatible 16-bit GUI executables for Win3.1x, Win95, WinNT and
OS/2 PM (Prof.version only). The Professional version can be used to
generate both 16 and 32-bit applications. The O/S independent VPI
(Visual Programming Interface) combined with a host of automatic code
generation and maintenance tools and full on-line help ease the
construction of complicated applications. The Visual Prolog Web Pages
at the URL 
   htpp://www.pdc.dk/vip/ 
contain product information and news as well as free Visual Prolog
tools and updates.  Prolog Development Center developed the well known
(but now extinct) Turbo Prolog from Borland. For more information US
customers should call 1-800-762-2710 or 1-404-873-1366, fax
1-404-872-5243, write to Prolog Development Center, 568 14th Street,
Atlanta, GA 30318, or send email to 75300.165@compuserve.com.
Customers in other countries should call +45 36 72 10 22, fax +45 36
72 02 69, write to Prolog Development Center A/S, H.J. Holst Vej 3A -
5A, DK-2605 Broendby, Denmark, or send email to sales@pdc.dk or
support@pdc.dk. A BBS is run at 404-872-5358. An early version of PDC
Prolog was reviewed  in AI Expert, January 1991. PDC has a forum on
CompuServe (GO PCVENB). To subscribe to the PDC-L@nic.surfnet.nl
