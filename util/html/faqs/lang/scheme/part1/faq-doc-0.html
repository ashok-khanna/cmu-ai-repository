This post contains part 1 of the Scheme FAQ.

If you think of questions that are appropriate for this FAQ, or would
like to improve an answer, please send email to us at ai+lisp-faq@cs.cmu.edu.

Note that the lisp-faq mailing list is for discussion of the content
of the FAQ posting only.  It is not the place to ask questions about Scheme;
use either the scheme@ai.mit.edu mailing list, the comp.lang.scheme
newsgroup or the Scheme Digest (scheme@mc.lcs.mit.edu) for that. If a
question appears frequently in one of those forums, it will get added
to the FAQ list.

*** Introduction:

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Scheme.  This file/article is
an attempt to gather these questions and their answers into a convenient
reference for Scheme programmers.  It (or a reference to it) is posted
periodically.  The hope is that this will cut down on the user time and
network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the same questions
over and over, as well as providing education by answering questions
some readers may not even have thought to ask.

This is not a Scheme tutorial, nor is it an exhaustive list of all Scheme
intricacies.  Scheme is a very powerful and expressive language, but with
that power comes many complexities.  This list attempts to address the
ones that average Scheme programmers are likely to encounter.  If you are
new to Scheme, see the answer to the question "How can I learn
Scheme?" [1-3].

The latest version of this file is available via anonymous FTP from CMU: 

   To obtain the files from CMU, connect by anonymous FTP to 
      <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/faqs/scheme/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/faqs/scheme/</A>  [128.2.206.173]
   using username "anonymous" and password "name@host" (substitute your
   email address) or via AFS in the Andrew File System directory
      <A NAME=id2 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/scheme/">/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/pubs/faqs/scheme/</A>
   and get the files scheme_1.faq and scheme_2.faq.

You can also obtain a copy of the FAQ by sending a message to
ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with 
   Send Scheme FAQ
in the message body.

An automatically generated HTML version of the Scheme FAQ is accessible by
WWW as part of the AI-related FAQs Mosaic page. The URL for this
resource is

We've tried to minimize the overlap with the FAQ postings to the
comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.clos and comp.ai newsgroups, so if you don't
find what you're looking for here, we suggest you try the FAQs for
those newsgroups. These FAQs should be available by anonymous ftp from
   <A NAME=id5 HREF="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/">rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/</A> [18.181.0.24]
in the lisp-faq/, ai-faq/ and scheme-faq/ subdirectories or by email.
For instructions on email retrieval, send a mail message to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "help" and "index" on separate lines in
the body of the message.

If you need to cite the FAQ for some reason, use the following format:
