<PRE>
The newsgroup comp.lang.scheme exists for general discussion of
topics related to the programming language Scheme. For example, possible
topics can include (but are not necessarily limited to):
   announcements of Scheme books and products
   discussion of programs and utilities written in Scheme
   discussion of portability issues
   questions about possible bugs in Scheme implementations
   problems porting an implementation to some architecture
Postings should be of general interest to the Scheme community. See also
question [2-3].

The comp.lang.scheme newsgroup is archived in
   <A NAME=id7 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.lang.scheme/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.lang.scheme/</A>
on a weekly basis.

Questions about Common Lisp should be directed to the newsgroup
comp.lang.lisp.  Discussion of object oriented programming in Lisp to
the newsgroup comp.lang.clos. Discussion of functional programming
language issues in general should be directed to the newsgroup
comp.lang.functional.  Discussion of AI programs implemented in Scheme
should sometimes be cross-posted to the newsgroup comp.ai.
