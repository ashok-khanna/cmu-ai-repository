<H1>[1-16] Why is Scheme called 'Scheme'?</H1>
<PRE>

According to Steele and Gabriel's "The Evolution of Lisp" paper,
Scheme was originally called Schemer, in the tradition of the AI
languages Planner and Conniver. But the ITS operating system had a
6-character limitation of file names, so the names were shortened to
PLNR, CNVR, and SCHEME. Eventually the truncated name Scheme stuck.
