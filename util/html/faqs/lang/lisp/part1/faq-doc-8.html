<H1>[1-7] Lisp Job Postings</H1>
<PRE>

The LISP-JOBS mailing list exists to help programmers find Lisp
programming positions, and to help companies with Lisp programming
positions find capable Lisp programmers. (Lisp here means Lisp-like
languages, including Scheme.)

Material appropriate for the list includes Lisp job announcements and
should be sent to ai+lisp-jobs@cs.cmu.edu. Resumes should NOT be sent to
the list. 

[Note: The 'ai+' part of the mailing list name is used for directing
submissions to the appropriate mail-server. The list is NOT restricted
to AI-related Lisp jobs -- all Lisp job announcements are welcome.]

As a matter of policy, the contents of this mailing list is
considered confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

To subscribe, send a message to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   subscribe lisp-jobs &#60;First Name&#62; &#60;Last Name&#62;, &#60;Affiliation/Organization&#62;
in the message body. 

(If your mailer objects to the "+", send subscription requests to
"ai+query"@cs.cmu.edu, job announcements to "ai+lisp-jobs"@cs.cmu.edu, etc.)  

For help on using the query server, send mail to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   help
in the message body.

Job postings sent to the list are automatically archived in
   <A NAME=id31 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/jobs/lisp/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/lisp/</A>

If you have any other questions, please send them to ai+@cs.cmu.edu
