<H1>[5-1] What documentation is available about object-oriented programming in Lisp? </H1>
<PRE>
Books about object-oriented programming in Lisp include:

   1. dpANS CL describes the entire Common Lisp language, which includes the
      CLOS standard.  Informally, CLtL2 can also be used to learn about CLOS, 
      but please remember that CLtL2 is not an official X3J13 committee
      document. (The presentation of CLtL2 differs from that of the draft
      proposed standard, and some matters of fact have changed in the proposed
      standard since the publication of CLtL2.)

   2. Sonya E. Keene
      "Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp: 
       A Programmer's Guide to CLOS"
      Addison-Wesley (Reading, MA), 1989. 266 pages. ISBN 0-201-17589-4.
           Tutorial introduction to CLOS with many examples and
           a lot of good advice for designing large programs using CLOS.

   3. Jo A. Lawless and Molly M. Miller.
      "Understanding CLOS: the Common Lisp Object System"
      Digital Press, 1991. 192 pages.

   4. Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres, and Daniel G. Bobrow.
      "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol"
      MIT Press, 1991. 335 pages. ISBN 0-262-61074-4, $34.95.
           The first part of the book presents a model CLOS implementation,
           introduces the basic principles of metaobject protocols, and 
           works through the key elements of the CLOS Metaobject Protocol.
           The second half is the detailed specification of the CLOS
           Metaobject Protocol. A simple working interpreter suitable
           for experimentation is contained in an appendix.

   5. Robert R. Kessler and Amy R. Petajan.
      "LISP, Objects, and Symbolic Programming"
      Scott, Foresman and Company (Glenview, IL), 1988. 644 pages.
           Includes a small Lisp compiler.

   6. A short introduction to CLOS written by Jeff Dalton of the
      University of Edinburgh &#60;J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk&#62; is available by
      anonymous ftp from  
         <A NAME=id5 HREF="ftp://ftp.aiai.ed.ac.uk/pub/packages/lisp/random/">ftp.aiai.ed.ac.uk:/pub/packages/lisp/random/</A> 
      as the file clos-guide.

   7. Andreas Paepcke, editor.
      "Object-Oriented Programming: The CLOS Perspective"
      MIT Press, 1993. 400 pages, ISBN 0-262-16136-2 ($40).
         This book is a collection of essays on the following topics:
           -  Description of CLOS and its design philosophy.
           -  The Metaobject Protocol and its use.
           -  Comparison of CLOS with Smalltalk, Eiffel, Sather, and C++.
           -  CLOS Uses and Methodology. Descriptions of two large CLOS
              applications (Sun's LispView and a hybrid knowledge
              representation tool) and an approach to documenting
              object-oriented protocols (similar to that of AMOP).
           -  Implementation details. Descriptions of TI CLOS for the
              Explorer and PCL's method dispatch mechanism.
