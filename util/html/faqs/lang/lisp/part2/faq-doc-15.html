<H1>[2-15] How can I have two Lisp processes communicate via unix sockets?</H1>
<PRE>
CLX uses Unix sockets to communicate with the X window server. Look at
the following files from the CLX distribution for a good example of
using Unix sockets from Lisp:
        defsystem.lisp          Lucid, AKCL, IBCL, CMU.
        socket.c, sockcl.lisp   AKCL, IBCL
        excldep.lisp            Franz Allegro CL
You will need the "socket.o" files which come with Lucid and Allegro.
To obtain CLX, see the entry for CLX in the answer to question [7-1].

See the file sockets.tar.gz in the Lisp Utilities repository
described in the answer to question [6-1].
