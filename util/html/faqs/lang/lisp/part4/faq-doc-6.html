   Franz Lisp 2.0 runs on the Apple Macintosh, requiring 1mb RAM for the
   interpreter ($99) and 2.5mb RAM for the compiler ($199).  Student prices
   are $60 for the interpreter and $110 for the interpreter and compiler.
   Includes editor and language reference manual. Complete sources are
   available for $649. The ALJABR symbolic mathematics system costs $249.

   Le-Lisp includes a compiler, color and graphic output, a debugger, a
   pretty printer, performance analysis tools, tracing, and incremental
   execution. Le-Lisp currently runs on Unix, VMS, and Windows 3.1.  Note
   that Le-Lisp is neither Common Lisp nor Scheme.  Le-Lisp was
   originally developed in 1980 at Inria, the French national computer
   science laboratory, by a team led by Jerome Chailloux for work on VLSI
   design. It was based on several earlier Lisps in the MacLisp family,
   but was not directly derived from MacLisp.  Le-Lisp enjoyed a large
   success in the French academic world because it was small, fast, and
   portable, being based on a abstract machine language called LLM3.  In
   1983, for example, Le-Lisp ran on Z-80 machines running CP/M. In 1987,
   Ilog was formed as an offshoot of Inria to commercialize and improve
   Le-Lisp and several products which had been developed with it,
   including a portable graphic interface system and an expert system
   shell.  Since then, Ilog has continued to grow and expand the use of
   Le-Lisp into industrial markets around the world.  Ilog is the largest
   European Lisp vendor, and continues to develop new products and
   markets for Lisp.  In 1992, Ilog released the next major version of
   Le-Lisp, Le-Lisp version 16.  This version modernizes Le-Lisp for use
   in the industrial world, adding lexical closures and
   special-form-based semantics for static analysis, a new object system
   based on the EuLisp object system (TELOS), an enhanced module system
   for application production, a conservative GC for integration with C
   and C++, and compilation to C for portability and efficiency on a wide
   range of processors.  For pricing and other information, write to

   CLISP v6.89 is a library of functions which extends the C programming
   language to include some of the functionality of Lisp. Requires
   ANSI C. Costs $349 with no run-time fee.

   or call or fax 203-429-3817.

   Jounral #192, September 1992, and Daniel Ozick, "A Lisp-Style Library
   for C", Dr. Dobb's Journal #179:36-48, August 1991. Source is available by

   Lily (LIsp LibrarY) is a C++ class library that lets C++ programmers
   write LISP-style code. Includes some example programs from Winston's
   Lisp book recoded in Lily. Most or all of chapters 17 (Symbolic
   Pattern Matching), 18 (Expert Problem Solving), and 23 (Lisp in Lisp)
   are implemented in the examples. Lily works with GNU G++ (2.4.5) and
   Turbo C++ for Windows. Lily is available by anonymous ftp from
     <A NAME=id43 HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/packages/development/libraries/">sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/packages/development/libraries/</A> [152.2.22.81]
   as lily-0.1.tar.gz. This site is fairly slow; a copy is available from
   the Lisp Utilities collection. For more information, contact

Other Lisps for PCs include: 

   o  UO-LISP from Calcode Systems, e-mail:calcode!marti@rand.org
      It comes complete with compiler and interpreter, and is optimised for
      large programs.  It is Standard LISP, not Common LISP. They are based
      in Amoroso Place in Venice, CA. 

   o  LISP/88 v1.0. Gotten from Norell Data Systems, 3400 Wilshire Blvd,
      Los Angeles, CA 90010, in 1983. They may or may not still exist. 

   o  IQLisp. Not a Common Lisp but still very good for PCs - you can
      actually get a lot done in 640K.  The lisp itself runs in less than
      128K and every cons cell takes only 6 bytes.  Unfortunately that
      makes the 640K (maybe a little more, but certainly no more than 1M)
      limit really hard. It has a byte code compiler which costs extra. 
      This has support for all sorts of PC specific things.
      It costs $175 w/o compiler, $275 with.
