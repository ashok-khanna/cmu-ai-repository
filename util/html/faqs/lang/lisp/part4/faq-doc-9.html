<H1>[4-9] What Lisp-related discussion groups and mailing lists exist?</H1>
<PRE>
Before posting to any discussion group, please read the rest
of this FAQ, to make sure your question isn't already answered. 

Scheme-related mailing lists and newsgroups are listed in the Scheme
FAQ, and AI-related mailing lists and newsgroups are listed in the AI FAQ.
     
First of all, there are several Lisp-related newsgroups:
   comp.lang.lisp          General Lisp-related discussions.
                           See below for archive information.

   comp.lang.clos          Discussion related to CLOS, PCL, and
                           object-oriented programming in Lisp.
                           Gatewayed to commonloops@cis.ohio-state.edu.
                           (or equivalently, comp.lang.clos@cis.ohio-state.edu)
                           See below for info on the newsgroup's archives.

   comp.org.lisp-users     Discussions related to Association of Lisp Users.
                           Gatewayed to the ALU mailing list. This is an
                           organizational mailing list/newsgroup, not a 
                           technical forum.

   comp.std.lisp           For discussion of emerging standards for
                           the Lisp language, including "de facto" standards.
			   Moderated by Brad Miller &#60;miller@cs.rochester.edu&#62;.
                           Submissions should be sent to 
                             lisp-standards@cs.rochester.edu
                           Archived on
                             <A NAME=id51 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.rochester.edu/pub/archives/lisp-standards/">ftp.cs.rochester.edu:/pub/archives/lisp-standards/</A>
                           Gatewayed to a mailing list (send mail to
                           lisp-standards-request@cs.rochester.edu to join).

   comp.lang.lisp.mcl      Discussions related to Macintosh
                           Common Lisp. This newsgroup is gatewayed
                           to the info-mcl@digitool.com
                           mailing list and archived on digitool.com.

   comp.lang.lisp.franz    Discussion of Franz Lisp, a dialect of Lisp.
                           (Note: *not* Franz Inc's Allegro.)

   comp.lang.lisp.x        Discussion of XLISP, a dialect of Lisp, and XScheme.

   comp.sys.xerox          Discussions related to using Medley (name exists
                           for historical reasons, and is likely to change
                           soon). Gatewayed to the info-1100 mailing list.

   comp.sys.ti.explorer	   TI Explorers Lisp machines.

   comp.windows.garnet     Garnet, a Lisp-based GUI.

   comp.ai and subgroups   General AI-related dicusssion.


The newsgroup comp.lang.lisp is archived on 
   <A NAME=id52 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/usenet/comp.lang.lisp/">ftp.gmd.de:/usenet/comp.lang.lisp/</A> [129.26.8.84]
by month, from 1989 onward. Individual files are in rnews
format. (They contain articles prefixed by a header line "#! rnews
&#60;nchars&#62; archive" where &#60;nchars&#62; is the number of characters in the
article following the header. That format is convenient for various
news processing programs (e.g.  relaynews) and is rather easy to
process from a lisp program too.)  A copy of the GMD archives for
comp.lang.lisp is available on cambridge.apple.com:/pub/comp.lang.lisp/.


We list several mailing lists below. In general, to be added to
a mailing list, send mail to the "-request" version of the address.
This avoids flooding the mailing list with annoying and trivial
administrative requests. [To subscribe to info-dylan, or
other mailing lists based at cambridge.apple.com, send a message to
majordomo@cambridge.apple.com with "subscribe &#60;list_name&#62;" in the
message body. Likewise use "unsubscribe &#60;list_name&#62;" to cancel your
subscription and "help" to get help.]
