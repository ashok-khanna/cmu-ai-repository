Repositories of Lisp source code are described in the answer to
question [6-1]. 

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

   The Allegro CL 3.0 Web Version for Windows is a full functional free
   version of our Dynamic Object Oriented Programming Development System
   for ANSI standard CLOS, with some limitations*.  This version includes
   an in-core native 32-bit compiler, a drag &#38; drop Interface Builder,
   full debugging and development tools and an editor.  We sell a supported
   version of this software, Allegro CL for Windows, without these
   limitations.  For more information, call 1-800-3-CLOS-NOW or
   1-510-548-3600, fax 1-510-548-8253, or send email to info@franz.com.
   Franz's web page is located at the URL
      <A NAME=id1 HREF="http://www.franz.com/">http://www.franz.com/</A>
   Suggestions and bug reports should be sent to web@franz.com. Since
   this software is unsupported, they may not get back to you, but the
   input is still welcome.
   * The limitations are: limited heap size, no foreign function support,
   missing compile-file, missing disassembler and missing save-image.
   The documentation fully explains these capabilities.

   CLiCC (Common Lisp to C Compiler) generates C-executables from Common
   Lisp application programs. CLiCC is not a Common Lisp system, and
   hence does not include any program development or debugging support.
   CLiCC is intended to be used as an add-on to existing Common Lisp
   systems for generating portable applications. (CLiCC has been tested
   in Allegro CL, Lucid CL, CMU CL, CLISP, and AKCL. It should run in any
   CLtL1 lisp with CLOS.)  CLiCC supports CL_0, a subset of Common Lisp +
   CLOS, which excludes EVAL and related functions. At present CL_0 is
   based on CLtL1, but is headed towards CLtL2 and ANSI-CL. The generated
   C code (ANSI-C or K&#38;R-C compatible) may be compiled using a
   conventional C compiler on the target machine, and must be linked with
   the CLiCC runtime library in order to generate executables. CLiCC has
   a foreign function interface.  CLiCC is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-kiel.de/pub/kiel/apply/clicc-0.6.4.tar.gz">ftp.informatik.uni-kiel.de:/pub/kiel/apply/clicc-0.6.4.tar.gz</A>
      [134.245.15.114].   
   CLiCC was developed by Wolfgang Goerigk &#60;wg@informatik.uni-kiel.de&#62;,
   Ulrich Hoffman &#60;uho@informatik.uni-kiel.de&#62;, and Heinz Knutzen
   &#60;hk@informatik.uni-kiel.de&#62; of Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu
   Kiel, Institut fuer Informatik und Praktische Mathematik,
   Preusserstr.  1-9, D-24105 Kiel, Germany. The authors welcome
   suggestions and improvements and would appreciate receiving email
   even if you just used CLiCC successfully. For more information,
   send mail to clicc@informatik.uni-kiel.de. 

   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) implementation by
   Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich
   University, both in Germany.  It runs on microcomputers (DOS, OS/2,
   Atari ST, Amiga 500-4000) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, Sun4,
   Sun386, HP9000/800, SGI, Sun3 and others) and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM.
   It is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL.
   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler, a subset of CLOS (e.g., no MOP)
   and, for some machines, a screen editor. Packages running in CLISP 
   include PCL and, on Unix machines, CLX and Garnet.  Available by anonymous 
   ftp from
      <A NAME=id3 HREF="ftp://ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/lisp/clisp/">ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de:/pub/lisp/clisp/</A> [129.13.115.2]
   For more information, contact haible@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de.
   There is a mailing list for users of CLISP. It is the proper forum for
   questions about CLISP, installation problems, bug reports, application
   packages etc. For information about the list and how to subscribe,
   send mail to listserv@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de, with the two lines
          help
          information clisp-list
   in the message body.
   A Sybase SQL interface interface for CLIPS is available
   by anonymous ftp from wuarchive.wustl.edu:packages/clips2sybase/. For
   more information, write to Sherry Steib &#60;sherry@informatics.wustl.edu&#62;.

   CMU Common Lisp (CMU CL) is free, and runs on HPs, Sparcs (Mach,
   SunOs, and Solaris), DecStation 3100 (Mach), SGI MIPS (Iris), DEC
   Alpha/OSF1, IBM RT (Mach) and requires 16mb RAM, 25mb disk. It
   includes an incremental compiler, Hemlock emacs-style editor,
   source-code level debugger, code profiler and is mostly X3J13
   compatible, including the new loop macro.  It is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id4 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/clisp/release">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/clisp/release</A> [128.2.206.173]
   Login with username "anonymous" and "userid@host" (your email
   address) as password. Due to security restrictions on anonymous ftps
   (some of the superior directories on the path are protected against
   outside access), it is important to "cd" to the source directory with
   a single command.  Don't forget to put the ftp into binary mode before
   using "get" to obtain the compressed/tarred files. The binary releases
   are contained in files of the form
                &#60;version&#62;-&#60;machine&#62;_&#60;os&#62;.tar.Z
   Other files in this directory of possible interest are
   17f-source.tar.gz, which contains all the ".lisp" source files
   used to build version 17f. A listing of the current contents of the
   release area is in the file FILES. You may also use "dir" or "ls" to 
   see what is available. Bug reports should be sent to cmucl-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.

   ECoLisp is a Common Lisp implementation which compiles Lisp functions
   into C functions that use the C stack and standard procedure call
   conventions. This lets Lisp and C code be easily mixed. It can be used
   as a C library from any C application.  It is available by anonymous
   ftp from 
      <A NAME=id5 HREF="ftp://ftp.di.unipi.it/pub/lang/lisp/">ftp.di.unipi.it:/pub/lang/lisp/</A>     [131.114.4.36]
      ftp.icsi.berkeley.edu:/pub/ai/ecl/  [128.32.201.7]
   as the file ecl-??.tar.gz where ?? is the version number. This is an alpha
   release. So far it has been tested on Sun workstations (SunOS 4.x),
   SGI (IRIX 4.x), and IBM PC (DOS/go32). For more information, please contact
   Giuseppe Attardi &#60;attardi@di.unipi.it&#62; or &#60;attardi@icsi.berkeley.edu&#62;.

   GNU Common Lisp (GCL) is a free implementation of Common Lisp (CLtL1)
   based originally on Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL). Versions 1.0
   and above of GCL (aka versions 1-625 and above of AKCL) are
   available under the GNU General Public Library License v2.0, and no
   longer require the kcl.tar file to build the system. For
   information on previous versions of AKCL, see the KCL entry. GCL
   generates C code which it compiles with the local optimizing C
   compiler (e.g., GCC).  It is intended to eventually support the
   ANSI standard for Common Lisp. GCL runs on Sparc, IBM RT, RS/6000,
   DecStation 3100, hp300, hp800, Macintosh (under A/UX), mp386, 
   IBM PS2, IBM RT_AIX, Silicon Graphics 4d, Sun3, Sun4, Sequent
   Symmetry, IBM 370, NeXT, Vax, and IBM PC 386/486 (linux, bsd).
   GCL version 1.0 and above are available by anonymous ftp from  
      <A NAME=id6 HREF="ftp://ftp.cli.com/pub/gcl/">ftp.cli.com:/pub/gcl/</A>		[192.31.85.129]
      <A NAME=id7 HREF="ftp://math.utexas.edu/pub/gcl/">math.utexas.edu:/pub/gcl/</A>		[128.83.133.215]
   as the file gcl-X.X.tgz (e.g., gcl-2.1.tgz), where X.X should be 
   replaced with the version number; you'll generally want the largest
   version number. The bandwidth to math.utexas.edu is higher than cli. 
   The file pcl-gcl-1.0.tgz contains a port of PCL (CLOS) to GCL.
   The file xgcl-2.tgz contains an interface to X Windows for GCL,
   including a low-level interface to Xlib, and in addition to being
   available from the above sites, is also available from
      <A NAME=id8 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/novak/xgcl/">ftp.cs.utexas.edu:/pub/novak/xgcl/</A>
      <A NAME=id9 HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/</A>
   For more information, write to William Schelter &#60;wfs@math.utexas.edu&#62; 
   (or &#60;wfs@cli.com&#62;, &#60;wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu&#62;). GCL is under
   continuing development, and folks interested in helping should send
   him email. Andy Wang &#60;awang@plains.nodak.edu&#62; has compiled GCL 1.0
   for Linux 1.1.50 (using gcc 2.5.8 and libc 4.5.26) and made the
   resulting binaries available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id10 HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming/gcl-1.0.bin.tgz">sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming/gcl-1.0.bin.tgz</A>

   Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is free, but requires a license. Conforms to CLtL1.
   KCL was written by T. Yuasa &#60;yuasa@tutics.tut.ac.jp&#62; and M. Hagiya
   &#60;hagiya@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp&#62; at Kyoto University in 1984. Austin
   Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) is a collection of ports, bug fixes and
   improvements to KCL by Bill Schelter (&#60;wfs@cli.com&#62; or
   &#60;wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu&#62;). Since 1994, AKCL versions 1-625 and
   higher are covered by the GNU GPL, so generally one will generally
   not need KCL (see GCL above for details). {A}KCL generates C code
   which it compiles with the local C compiler. Both are available by
   anonymous ftp from   
      rascal.ics.utexas.edu:/pub/ [128.83.138.20]
      <A NAME=id11 HREF="ftp://ftp.cli.com/pub/">ftp.cli.com:/pub/</A> [192.31.85.1]
      <A NAME=id12 HREF="ftp://utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/">utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.JP:/pub/</A> [133.11.11.11]
   KCL is in the file kcl.tar, and AKCL is in the file akcl-xxx.tar.Z
   (take the highest value of xxx).  To obtain KCL, one must first sign
   and mail a copy of the license agreement to: Special Interest Group in
   LISP, c/o Taiichi Yuasa, Department of Computer Science, Toyohashi
   University of Technology, Toyohashi 441, JAPAN. Runs on Sparc, IBM RT,
   RS/6000, DecStation 3100, hp300, hp800, Macintosh (under A/UX),
   mp386, IBM PS2, Silicon Graphics 4d, Sun3, Sun4, Sequent Symmetry, IBM
   370, NeXT and Vax. For the beta test version of the DOS port, see
   the files akclexe.zip and go32sexe.zip in
      <A NAME=id13 HREF="ftp://math.utexas.edu/pub/msdos/akcl-beta/">math.utexas.edu:/pub/msdos/akcl-beta/</A>
   Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
   11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax
   512-258-1342, E-mail guthery@acw.com, including a CLOS for AKCL.

   PowerLisp is a Common Lisp development environment for the Macintosh.
   It consists of a Common Lisp interpreter, native-code 680x0 compiler,
   680x0 macro assembler, disassembler, incremental linker and
   multi-window text editor. It requires a Macintosh with at least a
   68020 processor (any Mac except a Plus, SE or Classic) and system 7.0
   or later. About 2 megabytes of RAM are required to run it, and to do
   much with it you need more like 5 or 6 megabytes. Like any Common Lisp
   system, the more memory the better.  PowerLisp has the ability to run
   in the background. While executing a Common Lisp program, the user may
   switch to another application as it continues to run. You can also
   edit programs while a Common Lisp program is running. PowerLisp is
   targeted to be compatible with CTLTL2 without CLOS (for now) but some
   Common Lisp functions are not yet implemented. Upcoming versions
   should include the remaining language features. The current released
   version is 1.10. PowerLisp is available from America Online and Genie as a
   shareware program ($50). It is also available from the Lisp
   Repository, as
      <A NAME=id14 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/powerlsp/v1_10/powerlsp.hqx">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/powerlsp/v1_10/powerlsp.hqx</A>
   Written by Roger Corman. For more information, send mail to
   PowerLisp@aol.com, roger@island.com or rogerc34@aol.com (RogerC34
   on America Online). 


   RefLisp is a small Lisp interpreter. Versions exist for MS Windows,
   MS-DOS and UNIX (AIX). The MS-DOS version supports CGA/EGA/VGA
   graphics and the Microsoft Mouse. The interpreter is a shallow-binding
   (i.e., everything has dynamic scope), reference counting design making
   it suitable for experimenting with real-time and graphic user
   interface programming. Common Lisp compatibility macros are provided,
   and most of the examples in "Lisp" by Winston &#38; Horn have been run on
   RefLisp. RefLisp makes no distinction between symbol-values and
   function-values, so a symbol can be either but not both.  RefLisp
   comes with an ASCII manual and many demonstration programs, including
   an analogue clock which never stops for garbage collection.  It is
   written in ANSI C and is in the public domain. Source and binaries are
   available from the author's Web site at
       <A NAME=id15 HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~birchb/reflisp.html">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~birchb/reflisp.html</A>
   and from the Lisp Utilities repository by anonymous ftp from 
       <A NAME=id16 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/reflisp/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/reflisp/</A>

   WCL is an implementation of Common Lisp for Sparc based workstations.
   It is available free by anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id17 HREF="ftp://cdr.stanford.edu/pub/wcl/">cdr.stanford.edu:/pub/wcl/</A>  [36.93.0.31]
   as the files wcl2.2-solaris-src.tar.gz, wcl2.2-solaris-bins.tar.gz,
   wcl2.2-sunos4-src.tar.gz, wcl2.2-sunos4-bins.tar.gz, and
   wgdb4.2-sunos4.tar.gz. It includes a native solaris version (but with
   no dynamic .o loading or wgdb yet...), can use any version of GCC 2.X
   (GCC 2.1 is no longer required), and includes separate binary and
   source distribution so that recompilation is no longer needed to
   install WCL and WGDB. The wcl2.2-*.tar.gz files contain the WCL
   distribution, including CLX and PCL; wgdb4.2-sunos4.tar.gz contains a
   version of the GDB debugger which has been modified to grok WCL's
   Lisp.  WCL provides a large subset of Common Lisp as a Unix shared
   library that can be linked with Lisp and C code to produce efficient
   and small applications. For example, the executable for a Lisp version
   of the canonical ``Hello World!''  program requires only 40k bytes
   under SunOS 4.1 for SPARC. WCL provides CLX R5 as a shared library,
   and comes with PCL and a few other utilities.  For further information
   on WCL, see the paper published in the proceedings of the 1992 Lisp
   and Functional Programming Conference, a copy of which appears in the
   wcl directory as lfp-paper.ps, or look in the documentation directory
   of the WCL distribution. Written by Wade Hennessey
   &#60;wade@sunrise.stanford.edu&#62;.  Please direct any questions to
   wcl@sunrise.stanford.edu. If you would like to be added to a mailing
   list for information about new releases, send email to
   wcl-request@sunrise.stanford.edu.

   XLISP is free, and runs on the IBM PC (MSDOS), Windows 95, Apple
   Macintosh, and Unix. It should run on anything with an Ansi C
   compiler.  It was written by David Michael Betz, 18 Garrison Drive,
   Bedford, NH 03110, 603-472-2389 (H&#38;W), DavidBetz@aol.com or
   dbetz@xlisper.mv.com. The reference manual was written by
