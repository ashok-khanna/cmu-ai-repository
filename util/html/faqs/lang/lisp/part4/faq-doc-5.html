<H1>[4-4]  Free Implementations of Other Lisp Dialects</H1>
<PRE>
Franz Lisp:

   [Franz Lisp is a dialect of Lisp that predates Common Lisp. It is
   very similar to MacLisp. It lacks full lexical scoping.]

   The official archive site for Franz List Opus 38.92 and 38.93b (the
   last public domain releases) is
       <A NAME=id34 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/others/franzlsp/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/others/franzlsp/</A>
   It includes the official version from the ucbvax ftp site before
   its demise, Barry Schein's port of 38.92, the UC Davis port of 38.92,
   and Jeff Dalton's port of 38.92 (see below). For more information, 
   contact ai+franzlsp@cs.cmu.edu.

   An implementation of (Berkeley) Franz Lisp Opus 38.92 for 386/486
   machines running NetBSD 0.9 (and possibly also 386BSD and FreeBSD)
   is available by anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id35 HREF="ftp://macbeth.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/franz-for-NetBSD/">macbeth.cogsci.ed.ac.uk:/pub/franz-for-NetBSD/</A>
   The implementation generates C code and hence is quite portable. It
   has been tested on 68K Suns, VAX 750s, and ICL Perqs running PNX.
   A reference manual is included in the distribution. For more
   information, write to Jeff Dalton &#60;J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk&#62;, or see the URL
      <A NAME=id36 HREF="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~jeff/franz-for-386.html">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~jeff/franz-for-386.html</A>

   PC LISP is a Lisp interpreter for IBM PCs (MSDOS) available from any
   site that archives the group comp.binaries.ibm.pc, such as
      <A NAME=id37 HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors/msdos/lisp/pclisp30.zip">wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/msdos/lisp/pclisp30.zip</A> 
   PC-LISP is a Franz LISP dialect and is by no means Common LISP
   compatible. It is also available directly from the author by sending
   2 blank UNFORMATTED 360K 48TPI IBM PC diskettes, a mailer and
   postage to: Peter Ashwood-Smith, 8 Du Muguet, Hull, Quebec, CANADA,
   J9A-2L8; phone 819-595-9032 (home). Source code is available from the
   author for $15.

EuLisp:

   Feel (Free and Eventually Eulisp) is an initial implementation of the
   EuLisp language. It can be retrieved by anonymous FTP from
      <A NAME=id38 HREF="ftp://ftp.bath.ac.uk/pub/eulisp/">ftp.bath.ac.uk:/pub/eulisp/</A> 
   as the file feel-0.75.tar.Z. feel-0.75.sun4.Z is the Sparc executable.
   The EuLisp language definition is in the same directory.  Feel is also
   available from
      <A NAME=id39 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/languages/lisp/eulisp/">ftp.gmd.de:/languages/lisp/eulisp/</A> [129.26.8.84] 
   It includes an integrated object system, a module system, condition
   system, and support for parallelism (threads). EuLisp (European
   Lisp) is sort of like an extended Scheme.  The program is a C-based
   interpreter, and a bytecode interpreter/compiler will be available
   sometime soon.  The distribution includes an interface to the PVM
   library, support for TCP/IP sockets, and libraries for futures, Linda,
   and CSP.  Feel is known to run on Sun3, Sun4, Stardent Titan, Alliant
   Concentrix 2800, Orion clippers, DEC VAX, DECstation 3000, Gould
   UTX/32, and Inmos T800 transputer (using CS-Tools). (All bar the last
   four have a threads mechanism.) It can run in multi-process mode on
   the first three machines, and hopefully any other SysV-like machine
   with shared memory primitives. Porting Feel to new machines is
   reasonably straightforward. It now also runs on MS-DOS machines.

   Apply/Eu2C is an EuLisp-&#62;C compiler available from ISST.  Eu2C runs on
   top of Franz Allegro CL 4.1 and compiles EuLisp-Modules into C source
   code which then must be compiled by an ANSI C-compiler (currently only
   GCC is supported).  The Eu2C implementation provides EuLisp 0.99
   level-0, with the exception of concurrency. Future versions of Eu2C
   will include a C interface and straight module compilation.  The
   development of Apply/Eu2C was supported by the German Federal Ministry
   for Research and Technology (BMFT) within the joint project APPLY. The
   partners of this project are the Christian Albrechts University Kiel,
   the Fraunhofer Institute for Software Engineering and Systems
   Engineering (ISST), the German National Research Center for Computer
   Science(GMD), and VW-Gedas.  The main goal of APPLY project is to
   develop a Lisp system which consistently supports the efficient
   execution of applications and simplifies their integration into
   current software environments.  Towards that end, ISST is
   investigating strategies for the compilation of EuLisp-Modules into
   efficient stand-alone C-Programs. The Eu2C compiler is the first step
   along this path. Eu2C is available by anonymous ftp from
   <A NAME=id40 HREF="ftp://ftp.isst.fhg.de/APPLY/Distribution/">ftp.isst.fhg.de:/APPLY/Distribution/</A>.  Please send bug reports and
   comments to ulrich.kriegel@isst.fhg.de or ingo.mohr@isst.fhg.de. If
   you're using Eu2C, please send them a message with "Apply/Eu2C" in the
   subject line to be added to the mailing list of users.

   More information about EuLisp may be found in 
      Lisp and Symbolic Computation 6(1-2), August 1993
   which was devoted to EuLisp.

JLISP:
   jlisp is a lisp interpreter designed to be used as an embedded
   interpreter and is easily interfaced with C/C++.  jlisp is easily
   extended. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id41 HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.rochester.edu/pub/weisberg/jlisp-1.03.tar.gz">ftp.ee.rochester.edu:/pub/weisberg/jlisp-1.03.tar.gz</A>
