<H1>[6-1] Repositories of Lisp Software</H1>
<PRE>
There are several repositories of publicly redistributable and
public domain Lisp code. 

Common Lisp Repository:

   The Common Lisp Repository is accessible by anonymous ftp to
      <A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/</A> [128.2.206.173]
   through the AFS directory
      <A NAME=id3 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/">/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/</A>
   or by WWW from the URL   
      <A NAME=id4 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html</A>
   and includes more than 250 megabytes of sources, including all
   freely distributable implementations and many programs. This
   repository supersedes the Lisp Utilities collection, and is now
   part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository.

   Programs in the repository include XREF (portable cross referencing
   tool for Lisp, similar to the Symbolics Who-Calls and the Xerox
   MasterScope programs), Brad Miller's initializations package for
   Allegro CL 4.0, DEFSYSTEM (portable system definition facility, a
   "Make" for Lisp), a portable implementation of the X3J13 June 1989
   specification for logical pathnames, METERING (a portable code
   time/space profiling tool), SOURCE-COMPARE (a portable "diff" utility
   for Lisp), USER-MANUAL (a program which helps with documenting Lisp
   code), PSGRAPH (Joe Bates' PostScript DAG grapher), several matchers
   for Lisp, NREGEX (a regular expressions matcher), a date formatter, an
   infix reader macro for Lisp, SAVE-OBJECT (Kerry Koitzsch's package to
   save ASCII representations of Lisp objects to a file), Stephen
   Nicoud's semi-portable CLtL2 version of defpackage, LALR (Mark
   Johnson's lisp YACC parser generator), various implementations of the
   Loop Macro, William Schelter's sloop macro, Frank Ritter and Jim
   Panagos' implementation of the Yale yloop macro (described in
   McDermont, Charniak and Riesbeck's AI programming book), all free Lisp
   GUIs, including Express Windows, the iterate macro, Waters' Series
   Macro package, Waters' XP Lisp Pretty Printer, Bruno Haible's
   implementation of the Simplex algorithm, MAPFORMS (Moon's code
   walker), Brad Miller's resources package, and much much more.

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else 
   in the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is in the
   works.  We also plan to make the source code (including indexes) to
   this program available, as soon as it is stable.

   Most of the Common Lisp Repository appears on Prime Time Freeware
   for AI, Issue 1-1, a mixed-media book/CD-ROM publication. It
   includes two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs bound into a 224 page book and sells
   (list) for US$60 plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. For more
   information write to Prime Time Freeware, 370 Altair Way, Suite 150,
   Sunnyvale, CA  94086  USA, call 408-433-9662, 408-433-0727 (fax),
   or send email to ptf@cfcl.com.

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:
      <A NAME=id5 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/new/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/</A>
   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to
      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu
   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   The Common Lisp Repository is maintained by Mark Kantrowitz,
   lisp-utilities-request@cs.cmu.edu.

   clmath is a Lisp library of mathematical functions that calculate
   hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions,
   elliptic integrals, the gamma and beta functions, and the incomplete
   gamma and beta functions.  There are probability density functions,
   cumulative distributions, and random number generators for the normal,
   Poisson, chi-square, Student's T, and Snedecor's F functions. Discrete
   Fourier Transforms. Multiple linear regression, Fletcher-Powell
   unconstrained minimization, numerical integration, root finding,
   and convergence. Code to factor numbers and to do the
   Solovay-Strassen probabilistic prime test is included. 
   A technical report describing CLMath is available as MIT AI Lab
   Memo 774, Gerald Roylance, "Some Scientific Subroutines in LISP",
   September 1984. Iterate is Jonathan Amsterdam's alternative to
   series and the Loop macro. For more information, contact jba@ai.mit.edu.
