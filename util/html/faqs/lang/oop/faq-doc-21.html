An HTTP server has been installed at the Centre Universitaire d'Informatique
of the University of Geneva.  Information about various research groups at
the CUI is available, as well as a number of other experimental services.

The Object Systems group at CUI is providing a number of pointers to
Object-Oriented Information Sources available on the World Wide Web.
The page containing these sources is accessible from the CUI home page.
The URL is: <A NAME=id59 HREF="http://cui_www.unige.ch/home.html">http://cui_www.unige.ch/home.html</A>

You must have a WWW browser to access the information.  If you do not have
a browser, you should obtain, for example, the xmosaic browser from:
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:Web/xmosaic or info.cern.ch:pub/www.

The material available from CUI is in an early stage of development.
Suggestions for additional OO references to include (or whatever) are welcome!

&#62;28  Apertos(Meta-Obj Distr OS, research)

The Apertos (formerly MUSE) project at Sony Research
is a meta-object based distributed OS for turning portable wireless
hand-held computers into fully-connected Dynabook-like
terminals.  It's very very wizzy.  The papers are on: 
        scslwide.sony.co.jp:pub/CSL-Papers

The source is available for research; I think you have to
sign something first.
