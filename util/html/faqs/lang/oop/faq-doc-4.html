Product: Isis Reliable Distributed Object Manager(tm) (RDOM)
Company: Isis Distributed Systems, Inc., Ithaca NY, USA.

Isis RDOM(tm) is a fault tolerant distributed ORB platform for reliable
multi-lingual object-oriented applications. RDOM provides an "object group"
paradigm for constructing complex applications out of collections of
cooperating objects. RDOM is built on top of the Isis Distributed
Toolkit(tm). RDOM provides interfaces from Smalltalk (Parcplace),
Objective-C, and C++, and runs on most Unix workstations. RDOM is currently
not CORBA compliant, but will be brought to compliance during 3Q93.

Status: 

RDOM has been at beta test sites since January. General release of
the Smalltalk and Objective-C language interfaces is expected in June.
The C++ interface in August. Customers include AMD, Consilium and Swiss

3.9)  Why Is Garbage Collection a Good Thing?
---------------------------------------------

  From: Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk)

Garbage collection (GC) is a facility in the run-time system associated with a
language which will automatically reclaim objects which are no longer used.
OO Languages which require garbage collection include Eiffel, Smalltalk and
CLOS.  C and C++ can have garbage collection retrofitted (see [3] below).
[Ada has switchable GC, too -bob]

Without GC programmers must explicitly deallocate dynamic storage when
it is no longer needed (in C this is done by a call to free(3)).
There are a number of problems with this:

1: Bugs due to errors in storage deallocation are very hard to find,
   although products are available which can help.

2: In some circumstances the decision about whether to deallocate
   storage cannot be made by the programmer.  Drawing editors and
   interpreters often suffer from this.  The usual result is that the
   programmer has to write an application-specific garbage collector.

3: An object which is responsible for deallocating storage must be
   certain that no other object still needs that storage.  Thus many
   modules must co-operate closely.  This leads to a tight binding
   between supposedly independent modules.

4: Libraries with different deallocation strategies are often
   incompatible, hindering reuse.

5: In order to avoid problems 3 and 4, programmers may end up copying
   and comparing whole objects rather than just references.  This is a
   particular problem with temporary values produced by C++ overloaded
   operators.

6: Because keeping track of storage is extra work, programmers often
   resort to statically allocated arrays.  This in turn leads to
   arbitrary restrictions on input data which can cause failure when
   the assumptions behind the chosen limits no longer apply.  For
   instance many C compilers limit expression nesting, identifier
   length, include file nesting and macro stack depth.  This causes
   problems for programs that generate C.

One partial solution to a lack of GC is reference counting.  In this
scheme each object keeps a count of references to it.  When this count
drops to zero the object is automatically deallocated.  However this
is inefficient (swapping two references will result in three
decrements, three increments and six comparisons) and cannot reclaim
circular data structures.  Two systems that use a reference count GC
are the Interviews C++ graphics library and the Unix file system (the
link count).

Opponents of GC reply that it introduces an overhead which is
unacceptable in some applications.  However the overhead of manual
storage deallocation is probably as high as GC.  GC algorithms are
also available with good real-time behaviour.

[Further, GC can perform compaction improving locality of reference.]

Further Reading:

[1] "Object-Oriented Software Construction" by Meyer puts the argument
for GC.

[2] "Uniprocessor Garbage Collection Techniques," by Paul R. Wilson,
in Memory Management (proceedings of 1992 Int'l Workshop on Memory 
Management, Sept. 1992, St. Malo, France, Yves Bekkers and Jacques Cohen, 
eds.), Springer Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science #637.

This is an excellent summary of the state of the art in GC algorithms.  This
and other papers about garbage collection are available in PostScript via
anonymous ftp (cs.utexas.edu:pub/garbage/gcsurvey.ps.  [See APPENDIX E]

Weiser.  Software --- Practise and Experience vol 18(9), pp 807-820.

3.10)  What Can I Do To Teach OO To The Kids?
---------------------------------------------

Smalltalk (in its original 1972 version) was initially intended to make
computer programming easy enough for children.  The idea was that manipulating
objects was something more intuitive and natural than coding procedures.

Other entries or suggestions are welcome, please send to the author of the FAQ.

3.11) What Is Available On Object-Oriented Testing?
---------------------------------------------------

[This entry was donated by Doug Shaker and is certainly a FAQ]

Testing of Object-Oriented Programming (TOOP) FAQ/Resource Summary

Posted to comp.object, comp.lang.c++, comp.lang.smalltalk and
comp.software.testing.

Last revised on 93.10.27.  The most notable change is in the additions
to the Software section.  Also a couple of articles added to the
Written Material section.


&#62; What?

This is a summary of resources on the Testing of Object-Oriented
Programming that have been mentioned to me over the net, in email,
or other means.  Sections include Written Material, Courses, and
Software.  It is kind of like an FAQ, though it isn't organized 
that way.

&#62; Who?

I work for a Unix software house, Qualix Group, in the US.   Here is

I am NOT a researcher on the testing of object-oriented programming.
I just collate the stuff that is sent to me by people who REALLY know
something.  See the section "ACKs" at the end.

I just think it is important.

&#62; Why?

Why is this important? If classes are really to be reused in
confidence, they must be blatantly correct.  The classes must be easily
testable during initial evaluation by the client programmer.  They must
also be testable under different OS configurations, different compiler
optimizations, etc.  This means that testing modules must be
constructed in a way which is recognized as correct and the modules
must be shipped with the class libraries.  

As soon as one major class library vendor starts to ship real test code
with their libraries, all of the other vendors will be forced, by
market pressure, to do so as well, or face market share erosion.  Think
about it.  If you had to recommend a class library to a committee that
was choosing a basis for the next five years of work, wouldn't you feel
safer with a class library that could be auto-tested in your
environment?

		The focus of this paper is on ensuring quality by
		designing software that avoids acyclic component
		dependencies.  This in-turn permits incremental,
		hierarchical testing.  The importance of good physical
		design becomes a key factor only for large and very
		large projects.  Intuition gained from smaller projects
		leads to errors in large designs.  Compile-coupling
		("Insulation") is also discussed.

&#62; Courses

Berard Software Engineering, Inc. teaches a seminar on Testing of
Object-Oriented Software (TOOS).  The next one scheduled that I know of
is November 8-12, in Washington.  Call 301-417-9884 for details.

Quality Fractals, Inc. has a course called "Testing Object-Oriented
Software".  Contact: 508-359-7273 (Box 337, Medfield, MA 02052).  The
course is taught by Shel Siegel of YESS!, Inc.  Contact: 916-944-1032.


&#62; Software

There is a smalltalk class library in the Univ. of Illinois archives
which includes a simple Tester class written by Bruce Samuelson
(bruce@utafll.uta.edu). It is a general superclass for application
specific classes that test non-interactive objects such as trees,
collections, or numbers. It is not suitable for testing user interface
components such as windows, cursors, or scroll bars. The filein
includes Tree classes, Tester itself, and subclasses of Tester that are
used to validate the Tree classes. For ParcPlace Smalltalk (ObjectWorks
4.1 and VisualWorks 1.0). To get it ftp the file
"/pub/st80_vw/TreeLW1.1" from st.cs.uiuc.edu.

IPL Ltd. (in the UK) has a testing tool called Cantata which allows for
testing C++, but as far as I am able to determine, it has no special
features for C++ testing.  From the product literature:
	Cantata allows testing to be performed in an intuitive way
	making the tool exceptionally easy to use and productive in
	operation. Cantata is suitable for testing software written in
	either C or C++.

	Cantata provides comprehensive facilities for all forms of
	dynamic testing, including: functional testing, structural
	testing, unit testing and integration testing. Cantata has been
	specifically designed to operate in both host and target
	systems and so allow full portability of tests between these
	environments.

TestCenter from CenterLine will do coverage testing of C++ (and C)
code.  Also does some memory debugging (similar to Purify) and regression
testing.  Highlights from CenterLine literature:
  *Automatic run-time error-checking on executables to enhance quality 
  *Automatic memory leak detection on executables to optimize memory use
  *Graphical test coverage to highlight any code not executed during test runs
  *Intuitive GUI for easy test analysis 
  *Programmatic interface to output files and cumulative code coverage 
   to support batch-mode and regression testing
  *No recompilation needed, resulting in quick turnaround
  *Complete C and C++ language support
  *Integration with leading programming tools for maximum productivity gains

MicroTech Pacific Research (mpr.ca) has a C++ class testing tool called
ACE (Automated Class Exerciser) which is available under non-disclosure
agreement.  It is not currently for sale.  If you are interested,
contact Paul Townsend, townsend@mprgate.mpr.ca.

Software Research Inc. (625 Third St, San Francisco, CA 94107-1997,
voice: 1-415-957-1441, email: info@soft.com) has a coverage tool for C++
that is called tcat++.  It is an extension of SRI's tcat program.

Quality Assured Software Engineering (938 Willowleaf Dr., Suite 2806,
San Jose, CA 95128, voice: 1-408-298-3824 ) has a coverage tool for
C and C++ called MetaC.  It also dones some syntax checking and memory
allocation checking.

A group of volunteers is building a C++ test harness for the automated
testing of C++, C and Perl programs.  The system is called ETET (Extended
Test Environment Toolkit).  To join the group of volunteers, send email to
	etet_support@uel.co.uk
The software is available via anonymous FTP from bright.ecs.soton.ac.uk
(152.78.64.201) as "/pub/etet/etet1.10.1.tar.Z".  They are looking for
other FTP sites - sned email to the above address if you can provide
one.  This is a beta release and _should_ compile on any POSIX.1 system.
As much of this work is being done by SunSoft, my guess is that the
software will have the fewest problems on SunOS or Solaris releases.
