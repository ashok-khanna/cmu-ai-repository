SunSoft has made available statically linked binaries for the OMG IDL CFE,
for both Solaris 1.x and Solaris 2.x. Because they are statically linked,
these binaries can be used on systems which do not have the SparcWorks (TM)
compilers installed.

It is expected that people who only want an IDL parser will prefer to
obtain these binaries instead of compiling the program on their host.
People who want to build a complete compiler, by programming their own
back-end, will continue to obtain the sources which are also provided at
the same location.

The binaries can be obtained by anonymous FTP to omg.org. They are
installed in the directory pub/OMG_IDL_CFE_1.2/bin, in idl.SunOS4.x and
idl.Solaris2.x. Uuencoded versions are also available, in the same
directory.

Please send email to idl-cfe@sun.com if you obtain these files.

The attached copyright applies to the provided binaries and to the source
files provided on the omg.org file server.
