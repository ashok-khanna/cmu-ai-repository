<A NAME=id57 HREF="ftp://ftp.ircam.fr/pub/IRCAM/programs">ftp.ircam.fr:/pub/IRCAM/programs</A> contains some of the IRCAM-developed
software packages (in demo version; see further down for availability
of the fully functional versions), including runnable binaries for
both the DEC/ALPHA (osf1) and DEC/MIPS (ultrix) architectures, and soon
available on other platforms (SGI and Macintosh).

MAX

MAX is a visual, object-oriented, programming language, initially
designed for interactive musical performance, but which is suitable for
digital signal processing as well as real-time control.  It allows
interconnecting of oscillators and filters, building custom controller
modules and simulation units all from a core collection of signal
processing objects.

First developed by Miller Puckette at IRCAM in late 1986 to control
the IRCAM 4X, it was later implemented on the Apple Macintosh as a
graphical programming environment for MIDI applications.  This version
has been extended by the Opcode company in Palo Alto, CA (USA), and is
available through them.

The Alpha version (and its demo-only subset) is based on the NeXT
version, where it is used to control the IRCAM-designed ISPW board.
This card, based on two Intel i860 microprocessors, handles
numerically-intensive real-time operations.

To date, it has been extensively used in live performance of
full-length musical compositions (see some references in the MAX/doc
directory), as well as in scientific and experimental applications
requiring real-time control.

SVP

SVP (``Super Vocodeur de Phase'') is a signal processing tool which was
designed and developed at IRCAM by Gilles Poirot and Philippe
Depalle.  It is a full system for the analysis and synthesis of sound,
whose core is a phase vocoder, and which comprises several modules for
analysis (FFT, LPC..), filtering (band modes, surface modes...), time-
scaling, mixing, spectral combination, cross-synthesis and
amplification, which can be combined in multiple ways.

UDI

UDI is a library of C routines which provides a coherent software
approach for developing and maintaining digital signal processing
algorithms on stand-alone workstations or on host/array processor
configuration.  Initially designed for sound signal analysis and
synthesis, it can be used by any application which does vector math
calculation.

It provides functions ranging from elementary vector and matrix
operations to more specific DSP operations, such as, but not limited
to, FFT, least-square, linear prediction coding, discrete cepstrum and
pitch detection.

UDI was actually used in implementing SVP.

HOW TO RETRIEVE

The following example contains underlined text.  If it does not print
nicely, use your favorite editor in order to remove all occurrences of
"^H_" (control-H followed by underscore).

Connect via ftp to ftp.ircam.fr.  Engage into the following dialog (the
underlined text is the reply you should provide

        220 ftp FTP server (Version 6.17 Thu Mar 11 08:30:51 MET 1993) ready.

NOTE

The ftp server requires you to give as password something of the form
        l_o_g_i_n_@_h_o_s_t_
where l_o_g_i_n_ is your login name (or account name, or user information)
and h_o_s_t_ is the fully-qualified name of the machine you are currently calling
from, which is not necessarily the one on which you get your mail.  If you
mistype it, the ftp server will advise you with an informative error message.
