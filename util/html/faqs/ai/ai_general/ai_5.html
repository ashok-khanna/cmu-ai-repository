Subject: [5-0] General Information about WWW & FTP Resources for AI

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .gz, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .gz suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from

   prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/

as the files gzip-1.2.4.shar, gzip-1.2.4.tar,or gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe.

If you do not have ftp access, you can FTP files by E-mail. Send a
message with the word "help" in the body to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. As
the DECWRL ftpmail server is overloaded, you are encouraged to use an
alternate ftpmail server, such as ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au (Australia),
ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (Germany), ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk (Great
Britain), ftpmail@ieunet.ie (Ireland), ftpmail@lth.se (Sweden),
ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu (USA), ftpmail@ftp.uu.net (USA, message
relayed to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, so don't use it),
ftpmail@gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu (USA), or
ftpmail@seds.lpl.arizona.edu (USA). If you're on BITNET, send a
message with the word "help" in the body to BITFTP@PUCC, BITFTP@PLEARN
or BITFTP@DEARN (Internet equivalents bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu,
bitftp@plearn.edu.pl and bitftp@vm.gmd.de, respectively).

In general, see the Lisp FAQ for Lisp-related software and the Prolog
Resource Guide and the Prolog FAQ for Prolog-related software. If a
Lisp-based or Prolog-based system is listed here, only the ftp site
and directory will be listed; for a more detailed description, see the
Lisp FAQ and the Prolog Resource Guide. For information on obtaining
the Lisp FAQ or the Prolog Resource Guide see [1-0].

When referring to software, "alpha" indicates an internal early
release, "beta" indicates an external early release, and "omega"
indicates an external "finished" release. Generally an "alpha" release
means the creator hasn't yet tested for bugs.

Subject: [5-1] WWW & FTP Repositories

CMU AI Repository:

   The CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by
   Carnegie Mellon University to contain public domain and freely
   distributable software, publications, and other materials of
   interest to AI researchers, educators, students, and practitioners. 
   The AI Repository currently contains more than a gigabyte of
   material and is growing steadily. 

   The AI Repository is accessible for free by anonymous FTP, AFS, and
   WWW. A selection of materials from the AI Repository is also being
   published on CD-ROM by Prime Time Freeware and is available for
   purchase by mail or fax (see [6-5] for more information).

   The AI Repository is accessible by anonymous FTP from

      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/            [128.2.206.173]

   by AFS (Andrew File System) from

      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/

   and by WWW from the URL   

      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html

   Be sure to read the files 0.doc and readme.txt in this directory.

   The AI Repository is still under construction, but to date, the
   AI Programming Languages and the AI Software Packages sections
   are "complete". These can be accessed in the lang/ and areas/
   subdirectories of the AI Repository. Compression and archiving
   utilities may be found in the util/ subdirectory.  Other directories,
   which are in varying states of completion, are events/ (Calendar of
   Events, Conference Calls) and pubs/ (Publications, including technical
   reports, books, mail/news archives).

   The AI Programming Languages section of the repository includes
   directories for Common Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, Smalltalk, and
   other AI-related programming languages. 

   The AI Software Packages section of the repository includes
   subdirectories for:

      agents/      Intelligent Agent Architectures

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.  
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else in 
   the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A WWW interface to the keyword searching program is accessible
   through the URL

      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/keys/keysform.html

   We plan on making the source code (including indexes) to
   this keyword searching program available, as soon as it is stable.

   We hope to eventually have a fully automated calendar of events,
   an expanded AI Publications directory, mailing list and newsgroup
   archives, and much much more. 

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:

      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/

   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to

      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu

   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   For more information on the CMU AI Repository, please send mail to
   Mark Kantrowitz <AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu>.

Artificial Life Online and the Artificial Life BBS:

   Sponsored by MIT Press and the Santa Fe Institute, Artificial Life
   Online and the Artificial Life BBS is intended to be a central
   information collection and distribution site on the Internet for any
   and all aspects of the Artificial Life endeavor.

   A special feature of the BBS is a collection of 40 or so local
   newsgroups dedicated to a wide variety of topics in Artificial Life.

   Artificial Life Online is accessible by anonymous ftp from

      alife.santafe.edu:/pub/ [192.12.12.99]

   by World-Wide Web from

      http://alife.santafe.edu/

   and by Gopher from

      gopher://alife.santafe.edu:70/

   To access the Alife Online BBS (ALBBS) by telnet, telnet to
   alife.santafe.edu and login as "bbs". You will find yourself in a
   specially constructed UNIX shell within which either BBS menu commands
   or UNIX commands can be used to browse around in the system. Run the
   "account" program to set up a local account. These accounts will
   initially be provided free of charge, but they will eventually have to
   charge a nominal fee in order to cover operating expenses (on the
   order of $15-$25 per year). Subscribers to the Artificial Life Journal
   from MIT Press will have this fee waived. Once you have an account on
   alife.santafe.edu, you can telnet to alife.santafe.edu and login as
   yourself. You do not have to create an account to use the ALBBS via
   telnet -- you can simply login as "bbs" and browse through the system
   using the BBS commands.

   Please send suggestions and questions about the Alife Online/BBS
   system to feedback@alife.santafe.edu.

MLnet Machine Learning Archive
MLnet Online Information Service

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms.  By 1994 the
   library had a sizable collection of GLPed PROLOG software.  The site
   has grown, and now, according to the webpage it "offers a growing
   collection of ML information, datasets, software and pointers to other
   ML resources."  The current (May 1999) homepage is at:

	http://www.gmd.de/ml-archive/frames/Welcome.html

   In the near future (June or July 1999) this site will be succeeded by
   the MLnet Online Information Service (MLnet OiS) at:

Subject: [5-2a] WWW & FTP and Other Resources: Agents -- Planning

In addition to programs available free by anonymous ftp, we've
included some programs which are available by contacting the authors,
and some programs which charge a nominal fee.

Agent Modelling:

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell,
   <toby@castle.ed.ac.uk>, for his PhD thesis.  The thesis examines the
   problem of action selection when dealing with realistic, animal-like
   situations: how to choose, at each moment in time, the most
   appropriate out of a repertoire of possible actions.  It includes a
   description is given of a simulated environment which is an extensive
   and detailed simulation of the problem of action selection for
   animals.  This simulated environment is used to investigate the
   adequacy of several theories of action selection (from both ethology
   and artificial intelligence) such as the drive model, Lorenz's
   psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading activation network, and
   outlines deficiencies in each mechanism. Finally, it proposes a new
   approach to action selection is developed which determines the most
   appropriate action in a principled way, and which does not suffer from
   the inherent shortcomings found in other methods. The thesis includes
   a review and bibliography of existing work on action selection. The
   thesis is available by anonymous ftp from 

      ftp.ed.ac.uk:/pub/lrtt/ [129.215.146.5]

   as the files as.1.ps.Z, as.2.ps.Z, ..., and as.7.ps.Z.
   The simulation software is also available from the same site, as the
   file se.tar.Z. The simulation software was written in Suntools rather
   than Xtools.  It can be run only from SunView or OpenWindows.  The
   action selection problem modelled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing, not
   getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc), many internal and
   external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see the
   bibliography section on User Modelling).  This can be seen as a form of
   agent modelling tool, which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep
   nested belief spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs 
   that are typically held by groups of agents.  ViewGen is available by
   anonymous ftp from 

      crl.nmsu.edu:/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder [128.123.1.18] (user anonymous)
      ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/ballim    [141.58.127.8] (user ftp)

   as the file ViewGen.tar.Z. The theory of belief ascription upon which
   it is based is described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation which is
   archived with the Viewgen program (in the files 

      ViewFinder-{A4/A5/US}.tar.Z, 

   the variable part indicating the format of the PostScript file).
   The inheritance reasoner is in the file vf-hetis.tar.Z.
   Implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence easily convertible to
   any Edinburgh-style prolog. Contact Afzal Ballim <afzal@divsun.unige.ch>
   for more information.

Artificial Life:

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.
   Tierra runs on Unix, Win32, the Amiga and MS-DOS. Tierra's homepage is at:

      http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/tierra.html.

   The software can be downloaded from

      alife.santafe.edu:/pub/SOFTWARE/Tierra [192.12.12.130]

   To be added to the tierra-announce mailing list, send an email to
   Tom Ray (the author of Tierra as well as the list administrator) at
   ray@santafe.edu.  Send bug reports or questions about the code or
   installation to tierra-bug@life.slhs.udel.edu.

   For those without access to anonymous ftp, the Tierra software may be
   obtained on disk for $50 ($20 for upgrades) from Virtual Life c/o Tom Ray,
   ATR HIP Labs, 2-2 Hikaridai Seika-cho Soraku-gun Kyoto 619-02 Japan.  The
   software ships on PC formatted disks, but contains the source for all
   versions.

Chess:

   The SAN Kit chess programming C source toolkit provides common routines
   for move notation I/O, move generation, move execution, etc. Only search
   routines and an evaluation function need be added to obtain a working
   chess program. It runs on Apple Macintosh (Think C 5.0),
   Commodore Amiga (SAS C), MS-DOS, and Unix. It is available by
   anonymous ftp from

      raven.alaska.edu:/pub/coherent/sources32/ [137.229.10.39] in the
      chess.lm.com:/pub/chess/Unix/

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 

      ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z

   Contact Jeffrey Mark Siskind <Qobi@research.nj.nec.com> or David McAllester

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/

   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt <ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk> and Jens
   Doerpmund <dorpmunj@cs.man.ac.uk> and runs in Common Lisp.

   GPQUICK is a simple GP system implemented in C++.  It features an
   elegant object architecture with function (Function), program
   (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  The Problem class
   is proposed as a portable representation for problems that would be
   source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.  GPQUICK uses a
   steady state GA, tournament selection, one type of mutation, and
   subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear representation for
   S-expressions. It includes documentation from the associated magazine
   article (Byte, "Some Assembly Required", February 1994). GPQUICK is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cc.utexas.edu:/pub/genetic-programming/code/
   as the files gpquick.tar (unix version, tested with CC and g++) and
   gpquick.zip (PC/ANSI C version, tested with Borland 3.1).
