[1] General Information
-----------------------

 [1-0] What is this FAQ all about

 A: This is an attempt to put together a list of frequently (and not so
    frequently) asked questions about Natural Language Processing and their
    answers. This document is in no way perfect or complete or 100 % accurate.
    In no way should the maintainer be responsible for damage resulting 
    directly or indirectly from using information in this FAQ.

    The following questions and answers have been written by Mark Kantrowitz 
    (mkant+ai-faq@cs.cmu.edu): 4-2, 4-4, 6-1

 [1-1] What is NLP

 A: Natural Language Processing - definitions coming up :)

 [1-2] What is comp.ai.nat-lang

 A: Here follows the original charter for comp.ai.nat-lang. 

   Name:         comp.ai.nat-lang

   Moderation:   This group will be unmoderated.

   Purpose:      To discuss issues relating to natural language, especially
                 computer-related issues from an AI viewpoint.   The topics
                 that will be discussed in this group will concentrate on, but
                 are not limited to, the following:

                      *   Natural Language Understanding
                      *   Natural Language Generation
                      *   Machine Translation
                      *   Dialogue and Discourse Systems
                      *   Natural Language Interfaces
                      *   Parsing
                      *   Computational Linguistics
                      *   Computer-Aided Language Learning

                 This group will avoid discussing issues that are more properly
                 covered by other newsgroups.   For example, speech synthesis
                 should be discussed in comp.speech.   However, due to the
                 interdisciplinary nature of the field, there may be overlap in
                 material between other groups.    To try to keep this to a 
                 minimum, topics should pertain to computer-related aspects
                 of natural language.

   Rules of Decorum:  Because of the unmoderated format, anyone with access to
                      this newsgroup will be able to post without review.
                      This is meant to encourage discussion of the topics.
                      Please refrain from "flames" or unnecessary criticism
                      of a person's viewpoints or personality in a harsh
                      or insulting manner.   Criticisms should constructive
                      and polite whenever possible.

   Intended Audience:  The following is a repost of Terry Gaasterland's opinion
                       on how this newsgroup would fit in to the other 
                       alternative  newsgroups and mailing lists.

  [3-2] How to apply to graduate school in CL/NLP

  [3-2-1]How to apply to graduate school in CL/NLP in the USA

  Usually, the best timetable is as follows (given that M is the month
  when your studies would start, usually, in September)

        M - 24 : Try to clarify your interests, is it really NLP
                 that you are interested in, what possible
                 subfields might be of interest to you, etc.
                 Remember: 5 years working in an area you are
                           not interested in will be a very painful
                           experience.
        M - 18 : Read publications in the area of your interest
                 in order to discover the best places for
                 you to apply in terms of research, and 
                 professors.
                 Remember: Unless you are familiar with the most
                           current research, you will not be able
                           to find the best place for you.
        M - 18 : Go to your local library and consult some of the
                 available directories (see [3-3]) - write down
                 as much information as you can about some
                 15-25 universities. These universities form your
                 preliminary list.
                 Remember: There are some 100 universities in the
                           USA offering NLP/CL programs. Some of them
                           will be more attractive to you than others.
        M - 18 : Talk to your advisers at school, talk to other
                 students, post questions on the Internet.
                 This way you will get advice on a few more univer-
                 sities that you might have skipped until this moment.
                 Remember: Others have faced what you are going
                           through. Use their experience.
        M - 15 : Send letters to the universities that you have
                 on your preliminary list. Make sure you indicate
                 when do you want to start, what degree (MA, MS,
                 Ph.D.) you are interested in, whether or not
                 you will be applying for financial aid, whether
                 you will need some special visa...
                 Remember: Ask for all the information that you
                           need, give them all the information they'd
                           need to satisfy your request.
        M - 12 : Read carefully the information that you have 
                 received from the universities. Shorten your list
                 of places to the number that you will eventually
                 apply to (usually 5-8 is a good number). Make
                 Remember: Make sure you include both your best choice 
                           schools and some places where you are almost
                           certain of getting accepted.
        M - 10 : Fill in all the forms that are sent to you, 
                 ask your professors to send reference letters to 
                 the schools directly.
                 Remember: Professors will be probably very busy
                           at that time of the year (any time of 
                           the year...) Give them the reference forms
                           as early as possible and make sure you 
                           specify a reasonable time for them to fill
                           them in and send them out.
        M - 10 : (or earlier) - take the necessary tests (GRE,
                 TOEFL, or others) that the schools want. Make sure
                 you tell the testing service which universities
                 you want them to send your scores to.
                 Remember: Time yourself through several practice
                           tests. The GRE General test, for example,
                           is more about mastery of timing than knowledge.
        M -  9 : (approximately) - mail your forms to the schools,
                 preferably 2-3 weeks before the deadlines.
                 Remember: You don't want your applications to get there
                           at the same time as everyone else. Give the
                           admissions committee some extra time to
                           review your application
        M -  6 : usually six months before the beginning of the semester
                 that you are applying for, you will get a letter 
                 saying whether you have been accepted.
                 Remember: Usually, thick letters, e-mails, and telegrams
                           mean acceptance. Thin one-sheet letters will
                           most likely be disappointing for you.
        M -  5 : now, you have been accepted to a few schools. Go back
                 to the same resources that you used when you were 
                 deciding where to apply (journals, catalogs, directo-
                 ries, professors, etc.). Ask the schools that accepted
                 you to fly you in for a visit (many will do this).
                 Remember: Don't forget non-academic factors such as
                           location, financial aid, the athmosphere in
                           the department, etc.

[5] How-to questions
--------------------

 [5-1] How to join a mailing list

   A: Most often, you have to send mail to the listserver at the site where
       the mailing list resides, and put "subscribe &#60;listname&#62; &#60;yourname&#62; in the
      body of the mail message. The underlined text is what you have to type in.

      Example:

      Mail listserv@tamvm1.tamu.edu
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      Subject: some text here
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      subscribe LINGUIST Dragomir R. Radev
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      .
      ^

 [5-2] How to obtain files by anonymous ftp

   A: There are many ways. The most common way, however, is using a local ftp 
      client. 
      Suppose you want to get the file /pub/editors/webster.tar.Z
      from ftp.uu.net

      Here is a sample session. You type in whatever is underlined here.

      $ftp ftp.uu.net
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Connected to ftp.uu.net.
      220 ftp.UU.NET FTP server Thu Apr 14 15:45:10 EDT 1994) ready.

                               ^^^^^^^^^

      331 Password required for  anonymous.
      Password: radev@cs.columbia.edu
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  (put your email address here)

      230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
      ftp&#62; cd pub/editors
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 [5-4] FTP repositories

   A: Here follows a list of the most popular FTP sites that carry NLP-related 
      materials (data, tools, etc.)

   * Consortium for Lexical Research (CRL)

     The Consortium for Lexical Research is designed to serve as a
     repository for software and resources of importance to the natural
     language processing research community. Sharable resources, and the
     task of centralizing lexical data and tools, are of foremost
     concern in lexical research and computational linguistics. It
     is our objective to help alleviate the repeated recreation of
     basic software tools, and to assist in making essential data
     sources more generally available.

     CLR maintains a public ftp site, and a separate library of
     materials only for members of CLR. Currently CLR has about 60
     members, mostly academic institutions, and almost every major
     natural language processing center in the U.S. belongs. Access to
     the members-only materials is strictly regulated by password and
     userid.

     Our catalog of current holdings is available by using anonymous
     ftp to clr.nmsu.edu (128.123.1.12). The file to 'get' is
     "catalog.ps" for a postscript version, or "catalog" for a simple
     ascii version.

   * Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)

     To order LDC materials, send mail to ldc@unagi.cis.upenn.edu
     or fax your order to (215) 573-2175. If you require additional 
     information before placing your order, please call (215) 898-0464.

   * Oxford Text Archive (OTA)

     ftp ota.ox.ac.uk
     ota/textarchive.list         the current catalogue

     There are two classes of texts available from this FTP server

     (a) texts which are in TEI format and which we can make freely
         available (these all appear as category P texts in the shortlist)

     (b) texts which are available only under our standard conditions of
         use, (these all appear as category U or A in the shortlist)

   * University of Michigan Linguistics Archive (UMICH)

     ftp linguistics.archive.umich.edu
     /linguistics
     moderator: John Lawler (jlawler@umich.edu)
