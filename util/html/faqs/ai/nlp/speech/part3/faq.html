FAQ SECTION 5 - Speech Synthesis

  Q5.1: WHAT IS SPEECH SYNTHESIS?
  
   Speech synthesis is the task of transforming written input to spoken
   output. The input can either be provided in a graphemic/orthographic
   or a phonemic script, depending on its source.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q5.2: HOW CAN SPEECH SYNTHESIS BE PERFORMED?
  
   There are several algorithms. The choice depends on the task they're
   used for. The easiest way is to just record the voice of a person
   speaking the desired phrases. This is useful if only a restricted
   volume of phrases and sentences is used, e.g. messages in a train
   station, or schedule information via phone. The quality depends on the
   way recording is done.
   
   More sophisticated but worse in quality are algorithms which split the
   speech into smaller pieces. The smaller those units are, the less are
   they in number, but the quality also decreases. An often used unit is
   the phoneme, the smallest linguistic unit. Depending on the language
   used there are about 35-50 phonemes in western European languages,
   i.e. there are 35-50 single recordings. The problem is combining them
   as fluent speech requires fluent transitions between the elements. The
   intellegibility is therefore lower, but the memory required is small.
   
   A solution to this dilemma is using diphones. Instead of splitting at
   the transitions, the cut is done at the center of the phonemes,
   leaving the transitions themselves intact. This gives about 400
   elements (20*20) and the quality increases.
   
   The longer the units become, the more elements are there, but the
   quality increases along with the memory required. Other units which
   are widely used are half-syllables, syllables, words, or combinations
   of them, e.g. word stems and inflectional endings.

  Q5.4: WHAT SPEECH SYNTHESIS SOFTWARE/HARDWARE IS AVAILABLE?
  
   Please email any updates, corrections or additions to the following
   list. The range of commercially available synthesis software is
   growing rapidly so any help in keeping up to date will be appreciated.
   
    Orator Text-to-Speech Synthesizer
     * Platform: SUN SPARC, Decstation 5000. Written in C, and
       therefore portable to other UNIX platforms. Some successful ports:
       HP, RS-6000, PC-Unix [Linux].
     * Description: Sophisticated speech synthesis package. Has text
       preprocessing (for abbreviations, numbers), acronym rules, and
       human-like spelling routines. Natural-sounding synthesis based on
       demisyllable concatenation.
       
       Has high accuracy for pronunciation of names of people, places and
       businesses in America; good accuracy for English text; rules for
       stress and intonation marking; various methods of user control and
       customization at most stages of processing.
       
       A new version of the ORATOR system is under development. Both
       ORATOR and this new "ORATOR II" system are capable of very good
       general text synthesis. The ORATOR II system has a more
       natural-sounding voice.
     * Hardware: Runs on common SPARC or Decstation workstations, using
       their internal audio output capability. Recommend at least 16M of
       memory.

    TextToSpeech Kit
     * Platform: NeXT Computers
     * Description: The TextToSpeech Kit does unrestricted conversion
       of English text to synthesized speech in real-time. The user has
       control over speaking rate, median pitch, stereo balance, volume,
       and intonation type. Text of any length can be spoken, and
       messages can be queued up, from multiple applications if desired.
       Real-time controls such as pause, continue, and erase are
       included. Pronunciations are derived primarily by dictionary
       look-up. The Main Dictionary has nearly 100,000 hand-edited
       pronunciations which can be supplemented or overridden with the
       User and Application dictionaries. A number parser handles numbers
       in any form. A letter-to-sound knowledge base provides
       pronunciations for words not in the Main or customized
       dictionaries. Dictionary search order is under user control.
       Special modes of text input are available for spelling and
       emphasis of words or phrases. The actual conversion of text to
       speech is done by the TextToSpeech Server. The Server runs as an
       independent task in the background, and can handle up to 50 client
       connections.
     * Misc: The TextToSpeech Kit comes in two packages: the Developer
       Kit and the User Kit. The Developer Kit enables developers to
       build and test applications which incorporate text-to-speech. It
       includes the TextToSpeech Server, the TextToSpeech Object, the
       pronunciation editor PrEditor, several example applications,
       phonetic fonts, example source code, and developer documentation.
       The User Kit provides support for applications which incorporate
       text-to-speech. It is a subset of the Developer Kit.

FAQ SECTION 6 - Speech Recognition

  Q6.1: WHAT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION?
  
   Automatic speech recognition is the process by which a computer maps
   an acoustic speech signal to text.
   
   Automatic speech understanding is the process by which a computer maps
   an acoustic speech signal to some form of abstract meaning of the
   speech.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q6.2: HOW CAN I BUILD A VERY SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNISER?
  
   Doug Danforth provides a detailed account in article 253 in the
   comp.speech archives. A summary is provided below. It is also
   available by anonymous ftp

       <A NAME=id17 HREF="ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/info/DIY_SpeechRecognit">ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/info/DIY_SpeechRecognit</A>
       ion
       
    QUICKY RECOGNIZER sketch:
    
    Here is a simple recognizer that should give you 85%+ recognition
   accuracy. The accuracy is a function of the words you have in your
   vocabulary. Long distinct words are easy. Short similar words are
   hard. You can get 98+% on the digits with this recognizer.
   
   Overview:
     * Find the begining and end of the utterance.
     * Filter the raw signal into frequency bands.
     * Cut the utterance into a fixed number of segments.
     * Average data for each band in each segment.
     * Store this pattern with its name.
     * Collect training set of about 3 repetitions of each pattern
       (word).
     * Recognize unknown by comparing its pattern against all patterns in
       the training set and returning the name of the pattern closest to
       the unknown.
       
   Many variations upon the theme can be made to improve the performance.
   Try different filtering of the raw signal and different processing
   methods.
   
   Q6.7 contains information on public domain speech recognition
   software: Lotec and Myers' Hidden Markov Model software.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q6.3: WHAT DOES SPEAKER DEPENDENT/ADAPTIVE/INDEPENDENT MEAN?
  
   A speaker dependent system is developed to operate for a single
   speaker. These systems are usually easier to develop, cheaper to buy
   and more accurate, but not as flexible as speaker adaptive or speaker
   independent systems.
   
   A speaker independent system is developed to operate for any speaker
   of a particular type (e.g. American English). These systems are the
   most difficult to develop, most expensive and accuracy is lower than
   speaker independent systems. However, they are more flexible.
   
   A speaker adaptive system is developed to adapt its operation to the
   characteristics of new speakers. It's difficulty lies somewhere
   between speaker independent and speaker dependent systems.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q6.4: WHAT DOES SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE/VERY-LARGE VOCABULARY MEAN?
  
   The size of vocabulary of a speech recognition system affects the
   complexity, processing requirements and the accuracy of the system.
   Some applications only require a few words (e.g. numbers only), others
   require very large dictionaries (e.g. dictation machines). There are
   no established definitions, however, try
     * small vocabulary - tens of words
     * medium vocabulary - hundreds of words
     * large vocabulary - thousands of words
     * very-large vocabulary - tens of thousands of words.
       
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q6.5: WHAT DOES CONTINUOUS SPEECH OR ISOLATED-WORD MEAN?
  
   An isolated-word system operates on single words at a time - requiring
   a pause between saying each word. This is the simplest form of
   recognition to perform because the end points are easier to find and
   the pronunciation of a word tends not affect others. Thus, because the
   occurrences of words are more consistent they are easier to recognise.
   
   A continuous speech system operates on speech in which words are
   connected together, i.e. not separated by pauses. Continuous speech is
   more difficult to handle because of a variety of effects. First, it is
   difficult to find the start and end points of words. Another problem
   is "coarticulation". The production of each phoneme is affected by the
   production of surrounding phonemes, and similarly the the start and
   end of words are affected by the preceding and following words. The
   recognition of continuous speech is also affected by the rate of
   speech (fast speech tends to be harder).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q6.6: HOW IS SPEECH RECOGNITION PERFORMED?
  
   A wide variety of techniques are used to perform speech recognition.
   There are many types of speech recognition. There are many levels of
   speech recognition / analysis / understanding.
   
   Typically speech recognition starts with the digital sampling of
   speech. The next stage is acoustic signal processing. Most techniques
   include spectral analysis; e.g. LPC analysis, MFCC, cochlea modelling
   and many, many more.
   
   The next stage is recognition of phonemes, groups of phonemes and
   words. This stage can be achieved by many processes such as DTW
   (Dynamic Time Warping), HMM (hidden Markov modelling), NNs (Neural
   Networks), expert systems and combinations of techniques. HMM-based
   systems are currently the most commonly used and most successful
   approach.
   
   Most systems utilise some knowledge of the language to aid the
   recognition process.
   
   Some systems try to "understand" speech. That is, they try to convert
   the words into a representation of what the speaker intended to mean
   or achieve by what they said.

    IN3 Voice Command for Windows
     * Platform: PC with Windows 3.1
     * Description: IN3 is now available for MS-Windows. Users can call
       applications to the foreground with voice commands. Once the
       application is called, the user may enter commands and data with
       voice commands. Voice macros can reduce the strain of repetitive
       stress injuries (RSI) such as Carpel Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) by
       replacing heavy repetitive keyboard hammering with simple voice
       operations. Voice macros take complex operations and reduce them
       to simple verbal commands. Voice input can provide new facilities
       for tasks which could not easily have been otherwise performed
       without the multiple axis of input. IN3 is hardware-independent,
       users with any Windows-compatible audio add speech recognition to
       the desktop. IN3 works with either 8 bit or 16 bit Windows audio
       boards. IN3 is based on continuous word-spotting technology. A
       developer API is also available for creating voice-enabled
       applications.
     * Price: $179 U.S.
     * Requirements: PC with 80386 processor or better, Microsoft
       Windows 3.1, and Windows compatible audio system with microphone.
     * Misc: Fully functional demos are available on Compuserve in
       various Multimedia and CAD forums. Demos are also available from
       "America on Line", the comp.binaries.ms-windows archive sites, and

    Myers' Hidden Markov Model software
     * Description: Hidden Markov model software for automatic speech
       recognition. C++ code that implements a basic left-right hidden
       Markov model and corresponding Baum-Welch (ML) training algorithm.
       It is meant as an example of the HMM algorithms described by
       L.Rabiner and others. The code was built in order to learn how HMM
       systems work and we are now offering it to the net so that others
       can learn how to use HMMs for speech recognition. Keep in mind
       that ease of understanding was pit primary concern, not
       efficiency. The code can be used to build an experimental speech
       recognition systems using "train_hmm" and "test_hmm", and can be
       used in conjunction with written tutorials on HMMs to understand
       how they work.
