A list of books compiled by Josef Benedikt for the FLAI '93 (Fuzzy
Logic in Artificial Intelligence) conference's book exhibition is
available by anonymous ftp from 
   <A NAME=id17 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/bibs/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/bibs/</A>
as the file fuzzy-bib.text.

A short 1985 fuzzy systems tutorial by James Brule is available as
   <A NAME=id18 HREF="http://life.anu.edu.au/complex_systems/fuzzy.html">http://life.anu.edu.au/complex_systems/fuzzy.html</A>
An ascii copy is also available in the gzipped tar file

Wolfgang Slany has compiled a BibTeX bibliography on fuzzy
scheduling and related fuzzy techniques, including constraint satisfaction,
linear programming, optimization, benchmarking, qualitative
modeling, decision making, petri-nets, production control,
resource allocation, planning, design, and uncertainty management. It
is available by anonymous ftp from 
   <A NAME=id20 HREF="ftp://mira.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/pub/slany/">mira.dbai.tuwien.ac.at:/pub/slany/</A>
as the file fuzzy-scheduling.bib.Z (or .ps.Z), or by email from
  listproc@vexpert.dbai.tuwien.ac.at 
with 
   GET LISTPROC fuzzy-scheduling.bib
in the message body.
