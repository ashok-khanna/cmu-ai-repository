Hedge		

   A hedge is a one-input truth value manipulation operation. It modifies
   the shape of the truth function, in a manner analogous to the function
   of adjectives and adverbs in English. Some examples that are commonly seen
   in the literature are intensifiers like "very", detensifiers like
   "somewhat", and complementizers like "not".  One might define "very x"
   as the square of the truth value of x, and define "somewhat x" as the
   square root of the truth value of x.  Then you can make fuzzy logic
   statements like:
       y is very low
   which would evaluate to (y is low) * (y is low).  One can think of
   "not x" as being a hedge in the same sense, defining "not x" as one
   minus the truth value of x.
