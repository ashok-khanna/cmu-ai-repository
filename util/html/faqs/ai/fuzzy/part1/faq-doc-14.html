    Fuzzy Logic Anonymous FTP Repository and the Ostfold Regional College 
    Fuzzy Logic Anonymous FTP Repository in Norway.

The Turning Point BBS:

    512-219-7828/7848, DS/HST 1200-19,200 N/8/1

    Fuzzy logic and neural network related files.

Miscellaneous Fuzzy Logic Files:

   The "General Purpose Fuzzy Reasoning Library" is available by
   anonymous FTP from <A NAME=id8 HREF="ftp://utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/fj/fj.sources/v25/2577.Z">utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp:/fj/fj.sources/v25/2577.Z</A>
   [133.11.11.11].  This yields the "General-Purpose Fuzzy Inference
   Library Ver. 3.0 (1/1)".  The program is in C, with English comments,
   but the documentation is in Japanese.  Some English documentation has
   been written by John Nagle, &#60;nagle@shasta.stanford.edu&#62;.

   CNCL is a C++ class library provides classes for simulation, fuzzy
   logic, DEC's EZD, and UNIX system calls. It is available from 
   <A NAME=id9 HREF="ftp://ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de/pub/CNCL">ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/CNCL</A> [137.226.4.111]. Contact Martin
   Junius &#60;mj@dfv.rwth-aachen.de&#62; for more information.

   A demo version of Aptronix's FIDE 2.0 is available by anonymous ftp
   from <A NAME=id10 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/areas/fuzzy/code/fide/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/fuzzy/code/fide/</A>. FIDE is a
   PC-based fuzzy logic design tool. It provides tools for the
   development, debugging, and simulation of fuzzy applications.
   For more information, contact info@aptronix.com.

   FuzzyCLIPS 6.02a is a version of the CLIPS rule-based expert system
   shell with extensions for representing and manipulating fuzzy facts
   and rules. In addition to the CLIPS functionality, FuzzyCLIPS can deal
   with exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy
   and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an
   expert system. The system uses two basic inexact concepts, fuzziness
   and uncertainty. Versions are available for UNIX systems, Macintosh
   systems and PC systems. There is no cost for the software, but please
   read the terms for use in the FuzzyCLIPS documentation. FuzzyCLIPS is
   available via WWW (World Wide Web). It can be accessed indirectly
   through the Knowledge Systems Lab Server using the URL
      <A NAME=id11 HREF="http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/home_page.html">http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/home_page.html</A>
   or more directly by using the URL
      <A NAME=id12 HREF="http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/fuzzy/fuzzy.html">http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/fuzzy/fuzzy.html</A>
   or by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id13 HREF="ftp://ai.iit.nrc.ca/pub/fzclips/">ai.iit.nrc.ca:/pub/fzclips/</A>
   For more information about FuzzyCLIPS send mail to fzclips@ai.iit.nrc.ca. 

   FuNeGen 1.0 is a fuzzy neural system capable of generating fuzzy
   classification systems (as C-code) from sample data.
   FuNeGen 1.0 and the papers/reports describing the application and the 
   theoretical background can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id14 HREF="ftp://obelix.microelectronic.e-technik.th-darmstadt.de/pub/neurofuzzy/">obelix.microelectronic.e-technik.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/neurofuzzy/</A>

   NEFCON-I (NEural Fuzzy CONtroller) is an X11 simulation environment
   based on Interviews designed to build and test neural fuzzy
   controllers.  NEFCON-I is able to learn fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules by
   using a kind of reinforcement learning that is driven by a fuzzy error
   measure.  To do this NEFCON-I communicates with another process, that
   implements a simulation of a dynamical process.  NEFCON-I can optimize
   the fuzzy sets of the antecedents and the conclusions of a given rule
   base, and it can also create a rulebase from scratch. NEFCON-I is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ibr.cs.tu-bs.de:/pub/local/nefcon/ [134.169.34.15]
   as the file nefcon_1.0.tar.gz. If you are using NEFCON-I, please
   send an email message to the author, Detlef Nauck &#60;nauck@ibr.cs.tu-bs.de&#62;.

   The Fuzzy Arithmetic Library is a very simple C++ implementation of a
   fuzzy number representation using confidence intervals, together with
   the basic arithmetic operators and trigonometrical functions. It is
   available by anonymous FTP from
      mathct.dipmat.unict.it:fuzzy [151.97.252.1]
   [Note the system is a VAX running VMS.] For more information, write to
   Salvatore Deodato &#60;deodato@dipmat.unict.it&#62;.
