<H1>[1-6] Commercial Expert System Shells</H1>
<PRE>
The commercial products below are listed in alphabetical order.

ACQUIRE is knowledge acquisition system and expert system shell. It is a
complete development environment for building and maintaining
knowledge-based applications. It provides a step-by-step methodology for
knowledge engineering that allows the domain experts themselves to be
directly involved in structuring and encoding the knowledge. (The direct
involvement of the domain expert improves the quality, completeness and
accuracy of acquired knowledge, lowers development and maintenance
costs, and increases their control over the form of the software
application.) Features include a structured approach to knowledge
acquisition; a model of knowledge acquisition based on pattern
recognition; knowledge represented as objects, production rules and
decision tables; handling uncertainty by qualitative, non-numerical
procedures; extremely thorough knowledge bases; sophisticated report
writing facilities; and self documenting knowledge bases in a hypertext
environment.  
ACQUIRE-SDK, their Software Development Kit, provides: callable libraries for 
MS-DOS,and SCO Unix; DLL's for Asmetrix TooBook, Windows, Windows NT, 
Windows 95 and Win 32; and custom controls for Visual Basic. Call or email 
them for information on how to utilize the SDK to deliver applications over 
the WWW.
The ACQUIRE development package (knowledge acquisition system and expert
system shell) costs $995 for Windows 3.1 and includes manual, a tutorial,

nested premises (objects as values), rule packets (logical grouping of
rules), a full Truth Maintenance System (TMS) for efficient
non-monotonic reasoning, compilation of rules into C/C++ code, and an
object oriented data-model in C++. ILOG RULES work directly on user
objects, so interfacing is straightforward. C/C++ code may be included
in rule conditions and actions.  ILOG RULES is based on the fast XRETE
implementation of the RETE algorithm developed by Thomson-CSF.  For

OPS83 was developed by the developers of OPS5 as a successor to OPS5.
OPS83 is written in C, and OPS83 rule bases can be embedded in C
programs.  OPS83 was the first OPS-like language to provide this
integration of rule bases with C.  OPS83 supports Generalized Forward
Chaining (GFC), a new control structure that permits rules to be more
expressive; one GFC rule can replace several conventional flat rules.
(Details and examples are available on request.)  The current version
of OPS83 uses the proprietary Rete II algorithm to enable it to handle
large, complex rule sets efficiently.  A multi-windowed,
point-and-click development environment called the OPS83 Workbench is
offered.  OPS83 is available for DOS, OS/2, UNIX, VMS, and some
proprietary operating systems.  For information, write Production

RAL (Rule-extended Algorithmic Language) is a high-performance C-based
expert systems tool.  It was designed to permit seamless integration
of rules and objects into C programs.  RAL is a superset of C.  RAL
rules can operate directly on the data types used by the C code in
your application.  RAL "understands" C type declarations, function
prototypes, #define constants, etc.  C expressions, statements,
macros, function calls, etc. can be embedded directly in the rules.
RAL has an open architecture that permits it to be used with any GUI
builder, data base library, or other library that can be used with C.
No bridges are required.  For efficiency, RAL rules are compiled into
C code.  Charles Forgy, the inventor of Rete, has developed a more
efficient match algorithm called Rete II for RAL.  (Benchmark results
are available on request.)  A special version of the language, called
RAL/RT, adds the features that are required for real-time expert
systems.  RAL and RAL/RT have a multi-windowed, point-and-click
development environment called the RAL Workbench.  RAL and RAL/RT are
available for DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, and UNIX.  License fees for
development systems are available on request.  There are no run-time
fees charged for distributing applications developed using RAL.  For
information, write Production Systems Technologies, Inc., 5001 Baum
Blvd., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, call 412-683-4000, or fax 412-683-6347.

Rete++ supports both forward and backward chaining.  With Rete++ the
programmer can develop object hierarchies and instantiate, manipulate,
and access them using either C++, the standard rule-based syntax, or
C.  Asserting and modifying the data that is considered by rules is
done by creating a C++ instance and performing assignments to and
accessing the member data of the instance.  Rete++ automatically
generates C++ class taxonomies.  The C++ components of Rete++
applications use these generated classes directly or further subclass
them as needed.  The Rete++ inference engine automatically considers
any instances of a generated class (or its subclasses) in the matching
of rule conditions.  C++ data types provided by Rete++ allow more
flexible representation and automatic reasoning using standard C++
syntax without extraneous function calls.  Rete++ automatically
monitors changes to C++ objects without requiring programmers to
explicitly code function calls.  Rete++ is provided as a C++ class
library.  As such, it may be linked as part of your C++ application.
You may completely embed Rete++, with or without its graphical
development environment.  Modules for developing Case Based Reasoning
and integration with databases are available for Rete++ applications.
Rete++ integrates a dependency based Truth Maintenance System to
preserve logically sound and complete reasoning in spite of
non-monotonicity.  Multiple rulesets and agendas support modular
development and cooperating expert systems. Rete++ has an advanced
browser for rule based programming. The Rete++ windowing development
environment monitors the knowledge base with multiple views that are
all updated in real-time, allowing for debugging, browsing, the
monitoring and setting of break points, and the tracing of rules,
facts and goals.  Rete++ 16 bit Windows Toolkit costs $999, Rete++ 32
bit Windows Toolkit costs $1,999, Rete++ OS/2 Toolkit costs $1,999,
and Rete++ UNIX X/Motif Toolkit costs $2,999.  UNIX Versions available

RTworks is a family of independent software modules developed for
intelligent real-time data acquisition and monitoring, data analysis,
message/data distribution, and message/data display. RTworks offers a
number of sophisticated problem-solving strategies including
knowledge-based systems, a point-and-click graphical user interface,
temporal and statistical reasoning, and the ability to distribute an
application over a heterogeneous network.  Included with RTworks is a
high-speed inference engine (RTie) which is used to analyze the data
using objects, classes, procedures, and rules. The IE can perform
trending, prediction and temporal reasoning of rapidly changing data.
Displays can be built by non-programmers using a user-friendly DRAW
program.  More than 60 different formats are provided for displaying
input data including strip charts, bar charts, control charts, dials,
pie charts, and high-low graphs.  Graphical objects can be tied to
variables which dynamically control attributes such as color, scale,
rotation, motion, animation, and more.  RTworks runs in a
client-server architecture in which the RTserver process intelligently
distributes the application's messages and data to only the client
prcoesses which need them. User-defined client processes can connect
to the RTserver and send and receive messages with other processes in
the application. Possible applications include process control,
network monitoring, financial trading, and command and control.
RTworks is available on a variety of Unix and VMS platforms under a
floating license in which you pay only for the number of simultaneous
users, and the software is not node-locked to a particular machine.
Current RTworks customers include Lockheed, NASA, Dow Chemical, PG&#38;E

TechMate is a real life expert system designed to serve as a decision
aid and productivity tool for maintenance engineers and technicians.
TechMate minimizes the expertise required from the technician to
troubleshoot and diagnose problems in even highly sophisticated and
complex units.  Oriented for the functional level, TechMate can
troubleshoot units that contain analog, digital and mechanical modules
in electronic, electro-optic, hydraulic, or mechanical systems and
devices. TechMate is used in many fault isolation applications in
field service, depot facilities, and production lines. Its learning
algorithms make TechMate grow smarter with use.  TechMate is a
model-based system that derives its intelligence from universal
built-in knowledge bases and inference mechanisms, and from specific
knowledge about the UUT (Unit Under Test) supplied by the test
designer. It generates diagnostic assessments from the equipments
block diagram (which can be entered manually or imported
electronically) and the characteristics of the symptoms and tests. It
is also capable of diagnosing multiple faults.  For a given set of
symptoms and test results (including BIT results), TechMate's
diagnostic algorithms rank candidate faulty modules by their
likelihood of failure. It may also zoom in to further assess the fault
likelihood of each individual sub-module. Next, TechMate identifies
and evaluates the tests that may be used to isolate a fault, and
proposes the most cost-efficient tests. The sequence of tests is
dynamically reordered based on the symptoms, BIT and test responses,
thereby eliminating redundant tests. TechMate provides on-line
documentation of the device and its tests. It also includes a database
tool for storing and retrieving administrative data and sharing it
with commercial DBMS. TechMate can be interfaced with a wide variety
of test instruments and ATE systems. TechMate runs on Microsoft
Windows and on UNIX/X-Windows. TechMate customers include Texas
Instruments, Northrop, Raytheon, Honeywell, BARCO, British Gas,
Deutche Aerospace, and Siemens Plessey.  For further information, call

YAPS is a tool for building expert systems and other programs that use
a rule-based knowledge representation in Lisp. The YAPS library
provides a CLOS class and appropriate methods which the programmer may
mix into his/her own classes or use directly.  Rules and facts about
an instance are associated with the instance.  Instead of one large
knowledgebase with many rules which are hard to debug and maintain,
the programmer creates smaller knowledge-bases which are modular and
more efficient.  The YAPS knowledge-bases can interact with and be
controlled by the programmer's other modules, making hybrid systems
straightforward.  Introduced by Liz Allen at AAAI-83, YAPS is now
available on Apple Macintosh, Sun3 and Sun4 (SPARC), DEC VAX under VMS
and Ultrix, and 88Open platforms. On workstations, a single license
costs $3995 and on the Macintosh (under Macintoch Common Lisp), it is
$445. YAPS runs in most commercial Common Lisps including Allegro CL,
Harlequin LispWorks, Lucid CL, IBUKI CL, and Macintosh Common Lisp.
YAPS is also available for the TI Explorer and Symbolic Lisp Machines,
and a Flavors version is available for Sun3 in Franz Lisp.  Other
ports are underway -- for price and availability contact College Park
Software at 461 W. Loma Alta Dr., Altadena, CA 91001-3841, USA; or by
