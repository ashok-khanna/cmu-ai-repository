 TSP DATA
     There is a TSP library (TSPLIB) available which has many  solved  and
     semi-solved TSPs and different variants. The library is maintained by
     Gerhard Reinelt &#60;reinelt@ares.iwr.Uni-Heidelberg.de&#62;. It is available
     from          various          FTP          sites,         including:
     <A NAME=id HREF="ftp://softlib.cs.rice.edu/pub/tsplib/tsblib.tar">softlib.cs.rice.edu:/pub/tsplib/tsblib.tar</A>

 OTHER DATA
     Information about Operational Research test problems in  any  of  the
     areas  listed below can be obtained by emailing &#60;o.rlibrary@ic.ac.uk&#62;
     with the body of the email message being just the word  "info".   The
     files  in  OR-Library  are  also  available  via  anonymous  FTP from
     <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://mscmga.ms.ic.ac.uk/pub/">mscmga.ms.ic.ac.uk:/pub/</A>
       . A WWW page is also available at URL: <A NAME=id2 HREF="http://mscmga.ms.ic.ac.uk/">http://mscmga.ms.ic.ac.uk/</A>
      . Instructions on how to use OR-Library can be  found  in  the  file
     "paper.txt",   or   in   the   article:   J.E.Beasley,   "OR-Library:
     distributing test  problems  by  electronic  mail",  Journal  of  the
     Operational Research Society 41(11) (1990) pp1069-1072.
