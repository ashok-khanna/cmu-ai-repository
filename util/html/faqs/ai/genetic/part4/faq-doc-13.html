 1. Dedicated EC Journals:
  Evolutionary Computation
     Published quarterly  by:  MIT  Press  Journals,  55  Hayward  Street,
     Cambridge,  MA  02142-1399,  USA.  Tel:  (617)  253-2889,  Fax: (617)
     258-6779, &#60;journals-orders@mit.edu&#62;

     Along with the explosive growth of the computing  industry  has  come
     the  need  to  design  systems  capable  of  functioning  in complex,
     changing ENVIRONMENTs.  Considerable effort is  underway  to  explore
     alternative  approaches  to  designing  more  robust computer systems
     capable of learning from and adapting to  the  environment  in  which
     they operate.

     One broad class of such techniques takes its inspiration from natural
     systems  with  particular  emphasis   on   evolutionary   models   of
     computation  such  as GAs, ESs.  CFS, and EP.  Until now, information
     on these techniques has been widely spread over numerous disciplines,
     conferences, and journals.  [eds note: The editorial board reads like
     a who-is-who in EC.]  For paper e-mail submission,  use  one  of  the
     following addresses:

     o  America:       John Grefenstette &#60;gref@aic.nrl.navy.mil&#62;

     information  processing  sciences.  The link areas form a circle that
     encompasses  the  fundamental  nature   of   biological   information
     processing,  computational  modeling  of  complex biological systems,
     evolutionary models of computation,  the  application  of  biological
     principles  to  the design of novel computing systems, and the use of
     biomolecular materials to synthesize artificial systems that  capture
     essential principles of natural biological information processing.

     Topics:  Molecular  EVOLUTION:  Self-organizing  and self-replicating
     systems, Origin and evolution of the  genetic  mechanism;  Biological
     Information  Processing:   Molecular  recognition,  Cellular control,
     Neuromuscular computing, Biological adaptability, Molecular computing
     technologies;    EVOLUTIONARY    SYSTEMS:   Stochastic   evolutionary
     algorithms, Evolutionary  OPTIMIZATION,  SIMULATION  of  genetic  and
     ecological  systems,  Applications  (neural  nets,  machine learning,
     robotics))

  Complex Systems
     Published by: Complex Systems  Publications,  Inc.,  P.O.  Box  6149,
     Champaign, IL 61821-8149, USA.
     Complex  Systems  devotes to the rapid publication of research on the
     science,  mathematics,  and  engineering  of  systems   with   simple
     components   but   complex   overall   behavior.   Try  finger(1)  on

  Machine Learning
     Published by:  Kluwer  Academic  Publishers,  P.O.  Box  358,  Accord
     Station, Hingham, MA 02018-0358 USA.

     Machine   Learning   is   an  international  forum  for  research  on
     computational approaches to learning. The journal publishes  articles
     reporting  substantive  research  results on a wide range of learning
     methods applied to a variety of task domains. The  ideal  paper  will
     make   a   theoretical   contribution   supported   by   a   computer
     implementation.

     The journal  has  published  many  key  papers  in  learning  theory,
     reinforcement  learning,  and  decision  tree  methods.   The journal
     regularly publishes special issues devoted to GAs and CFS as well.

  Adaptive Behavior
     Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.

     Broadly, behavior is adaptive if it deals successfully  with  changes
     circumstances.   For   example,   when   surprised,  a  hungry  --but
     environmentally informed-- mouse  may  dart  for  cover  rather  than
     another piece of cheese. Similarly, a tripped-up ROBOT [eds note: not
     necessarily built by Sirius Cybernetics Corp.]  could get back on its
     feet  and  accomplish a moonrock-finding mission if it had learned to
     cope with unanticipated lunar potholes.

     Adaptive Behavior thus takes an approach complementary to traditional
     AI.   Now basic abilities that allow animals to survive, or ROBOTs to
     perform their mission in unpredictable ENVIRONMENTs, will be  studied
     in preference to more elaborate and human-specific abilities.

     The  journal  also  aims  to  investigate  which  new  insights  into
     intelligence and cognition can be achieved by explicitly taking  into
     account  the  ENVIRONMENT  feedback  --mediated by behavior-- that an
     animal or  a  ROBOT  receives,  instead  of  studying  components  of
     intelligence in isolation.

     Topics:  INDIVIDUAL  and  Collective  Behavior.  Neural Correlates of
     Behavior. Perception  and  Motor  Control.  Motivation  and  Emotion.
     Action  SELECTION  and  Behavioral  Sequences. Internal World Models.
     Ontogeny, Learning, and EVOLUTION.  Characterization of ENVIRONMENTs.

  Artificial Life
     Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.

     Artificial  Life  is  intended  to  be  the  primary  forum  for  the
     dissemination of scientific and engineering research in the field  of
     ARTIFICIAL  LIFE.   It will report on synthetic biological work being
     carried out in any and all media,  from  the  familiar  "wetware"  of
     organic chemistry, through the inorganic "hardware" of mobile ROBOTs,
     all the way to the virtual "software" residing inside computers.

     Research topics ranging  from  the  fabrication  of  self-replicating
     molecules  to  the study of evolving POPULATIONs of computer programs
     will be included.

     There will also be occasional issues devoted to special topics,  such
     as  L-Systems,  GENETIC  ALGORITHMs, in-vitro EVOLUTION of molecules,
     artificial cells, computer viruses, and many social and philosophical
     issues arising from the attempt to synthesize life artificially.

  Evolutionary Economics
     Published  quarterly  by:  Springer-Verlag  New  York,  Inc., Service
     Center Secaucus, 44 Hartz Way, Secaucus, NJ 07094, USA.   Tel:  (201)
     348-4033, Fax: (201) 348-4505.

     Evolutionary  Economics  aims to provide an international forum for a
     new approach to economics.  Following  the  tradition  of  Joseph  A.
     Schlumpeter,  it  is  designed  to focus on original research with an
     evolutionary conception of the economy.   The  journal  will  publish
     articles  with  strong  emphasis  on  dynamics,  changing  structures
     (including technologies, institutions, beliefs, imitation, etc.).  It
     favors  interdisciplinary  analysis  and  is  devoted to theoretical,
     methodological and applied work.

     Research  areas  include:  industrial  dynamics;  multi-sectoral  and
     cross-country   studies   of   productivity;   innovations   and  new
     technologies; dynamic competition and structural change in a national
     and  international  context;  causes  and  effects  of technological,
     political and social changes; cyclic processes in economic EVOLUTION;
     the  role of governments in a dynamic world; modeling complex dynamic
     economic systems; application of concepts, such as self-organization,
     bifurcation, and chaos theory to economics; evolutionary games.
