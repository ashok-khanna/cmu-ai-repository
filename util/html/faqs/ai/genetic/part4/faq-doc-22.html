<H1>Q15.5: What about all these Internet Services?</H1>
<PRE>

     The Internet supports a variety of on-line services, and a number  of
     tools  are  available  to  enable  people  to make good use of these,
     including:  telnet,  FTP,  gopher,  veronica,   archie,   Wide   Area
     Information Servers (WAIS), and the World-Wide Web (WWW).
     Information  about  using  Internet  is  available  from  a number of
     sources, many accesible on-line, via email or FTP.  For example,  the
     EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) publishes two guides for novices
     on all  the  Internet  has  to  offer,   by  Adam  Gaffin  and  Joerg
     Heitkoetter (see below). These are avaiable over the net.

     To receive a short guide to using anonymous FTP, send e-mail with the
     text "help" to &#60;info@sunsite.unc.edu&#62;.

     If you dont have FTP access, you can  retrieve  documents  using  the
     FTP-by-email  service.  The "ftpmail" service is installed on several
     sites to allow transmission of FTPable files from almost anywhere. To
     get  the  PostScript version of this FAQ from ENCORE, (See Q15.3) for
     example, send a message  to  (for  example)  &#60;ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com&#62;
     containing the lines:
	       reply &#60;your-own-e-mail-address-here&#62;
	       connect alife.santafe.edu
	       get pub/USER-AREA/EC/FAQ/hhgtec.ps.gz
	       quit
     where &#60;your-e-mail-address&#62; is e.g. foo@bar.edu

     FTPmail  sites  available  are listed below. Use one that is near you
     for best performance.

	 (USA)     &#60;ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com&#62;
		   &#60;ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu&#62;
		   &#60;bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu&#62;

	 (Europe)  &#60;bitftp@dearn&#62; or to &#60;bitftp@vm.gmd.de&#62;
		   &#60;ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de&#62;
		   &#60;ftpmail@ftp.inf.tu-dresden.de&#62;
		   &#60;ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr&#62;
		   &#60;bitftp@plearn.edu.pl&#62;
		   &#60;ftpmail@doc.ic.ak.uk&#62;

     Documents  from  the  archive  at  &#60;rtfm.mit.edu&#62;  can  be  retrieved
     similarly  by sending email to &#60;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&#62;, containing
     a message such as:

	  send usenet/news.answers/index
	  send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part1
	  quit
