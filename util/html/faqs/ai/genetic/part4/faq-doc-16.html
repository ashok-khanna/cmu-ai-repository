<H1>Q14: What Technical Reports are available?</H1>
<PRE>
     Technical reports are informally published, unrefereed papers  giving
     up-to-date  information  on  what is going on at research institutes.
     Many later  go  on  to  be  formally  published  in  journals  or  at
     conferences.

 TCGA Reports
     The  Clearing  House  for  Genetic  Algorithms (TCGA) at the Univ. of
     Alabama (Tuscaloosa) distributes TCGA technical reports. A number  of
     these  are  now available in compressed Postscript form via FTP from:
     <A NAME=id22 HREF="ftp://aramis.cs.ua.edu/pub/tech-reports/">aramis.cs.ua.edu:/pub/tech-reports/</A>
      . Read the file README first.

     Contact:  Robert  Elliott  Smith,  Department   of   Engineering   of
     Mechanics,  Room  210  Hardaway Hall, The University of Alabama, P.O.

     other information at: <A NAME=id24 HREF="ftp://<a name=id25 href=/"ftp://gal4.ge.uiuc.edu/illigal.home.html</A>">gal4.ge.uiuc.edu:/illigal.home.html">ftp://<A NAME=id26 HREF="ftp://gal4.ge.uiuc.edu/illigal.home.html</A></A>">gal4.ge.uiuc.edu:/illigal.home.html</A></A></A>

 SyS Reports
     The  Systems  Analysis  Research  Group  (SyS)  at  the University of
     Dortmund,   maintains   an   experimental   anonymous   FTP   server:
     <A NAME=id27 HREF="ftp://lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/pub/">lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de:/pub/</A>
      .  On  lumpi  you  can find SyS-Reports from 1992 on. (Get "/pub/ls-
     Ral.Z" and look for "papers" folders, the  server  is  sorted  by  EA
     paradigms,  i.e.  "/pub/GA/papers"  contains  papers  related to GAs,
     etc.).  A strongly recommended, and quarterly updated,  report  is  a
     list   of   current   applications   of   GAs,   EP   and   ESs;  get
     "/pub/EA/papers/ea-app.ps.gz" (SyS-2/92).

 Bionics Reports
     The Bionics and EVOLUTION  Techniques  Laboratory  at  the  Technical
     University   of  Berlin  maintains  an  anonymous  FTP  server:  ftp-
     bionik.fb10.tu-berlin.de:/pub/
      .  On  ftp-bionik  you  find  reports  and  software,   related   to
     Evolutionary Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks.

 University College London Reports
     A  number  of GENETIC ALGORITHM reports produced by UCL are available
     via  anonymous  FTP  at  <A NAME=id28 HREF="ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/genetic/papers/">cs.ucl.ac.uk:/genetic/papers/</A>  Abstracts  of
     others can be obtained via WWW at <A NAME=id29 HREF="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/rns/">http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/rns/</A>
