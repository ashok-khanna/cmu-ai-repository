[0.1]  Where to find this FAQ and comp.robotics archives

[0.1.1] Information for New Users of the Internet.

If you haven't done so, new users on the net should read
news:news.announce.newusers. In particular, the following posts are a good
idea:
	-A Primer on How to Work With The Usenet Community
	-Answers to Frequently Asked Questions About Usenet
	-Hints on Writing Style for Usenet

This FAQ is currently posted to comp.answers, news.answers and
comp.robotics.  All posts to news.answers are archived and are
available via anonymous FTP and e-mail from the following locations:

The World Wide Web:

WorldWideWeb (W3 or WWW) is the universe of network-accessible
information, an initiative started at CERN, now with many
participants. It has a body of software, and a set of protocols and
conventions. W3 uses hypertext and multimedia techniques to make the
web easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute to. Future
evolution of W3 is coordinated by the W3 Organization. The W3 has
grown into an extraordinary means of finding information about
organizations, people, companies, products and many, many other
things. Many browsers have been developed to search the net. Some of 
the most popular are Mosaic, MacWeb and Netscape.

If you are not using the Web or browsers: Learn! The WWW is already a
main source of information on the net and it is very easy to use with
the browsing and surfing tools now available. Within the robotics
community it is already providing robotic tools, images, videos,
teleoperation and observation.

The following is a general introduction to the WWW:
	<A NAME=id1 HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</A>

If you have electronic mail, then it possible (though slow!) to get W3
information by mail. try sending a mail to listserv@info.cern.ch with
a line in it saying just HELP to get back instructions. Your mail
system must have a mail gateway onto internet mail, but that is quite
likely. You might have to take the internet address above and ask your
friendly system manager how to convert it into the equivalent mail
address on the system you are using.

Archives:
	There are a number of sites in the US, Europe and Japan
	that store the FAQ and archives for comp.robotics. You can
	find these by using the Internet search programs, Archie,
	Gopher or Wais.

	Archives of comp.robotics and many AI-related newsgroups
	can now be found in appropriate subdirectories of
		<A NAME=id8 HREF="ftp://<a name=id9 href=/"ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/news/</A>">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/">ftp://<A NAME=id10 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/news/</A></A>">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/</A></A></A>

	Each of these newsgroups is being automatically archived on a
	weekly basis.  For example, the gzipped tar file 94_10_08.tgz
	in the comp.lang.lisp/ subdirectory contains all articles that
	appeared in the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup during the previous
	week. Links to these archives also exist in many of the
	topical directories of the CMU AI Repository (e.g.,
	/user/ai/lang/lisp/news/ contains links to Lisp-related
	newsgroups). The archives for most of the newsgroups start
	with articles appearing on 23-JUL-94. Comments and suggestions
	should be sent to ai+news-archives@cs.cmu.edu.

	The following site,
  <A NAME=id12 HREF="ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/users/claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html">ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/users/claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html</A>
	indexes not only the CMU AI archives of newsgroups, but over a
	hundred other publicly-accessible sites.

	Another location is:
		<A NAME=id13 HREF="ftp://wilma.cs.brown.edu/pub/comp.robotics/">ftp://wilma.cs.brown.edu/pub/comp.robotics/</A>

	In addition to the FTP archive maintained at
	wilma.cs.brown.edu, there are a couple of other mechanisms
	available:
	- The comp.robotics archive at wilma is also available as a WAIS
	source (called "comp.robotics.src"), and hence it is also
	available to WWW browsers, via the appropriate WAIS gateway.
	- Moises Lejter maintains a mailing list of individuals who
	would rather receive comp.robotics via Email as a daily digest
	of all messages posted to comp.robotics in each 24-hour
	period.  Anyone interested should send email directly to
	&#60;mlm@cs.brown.edu&#62;.  It's a LOT of mail though...

[1] What is robotics?
	In this section we define the words 'robot' and 'robotics' and
look a little at the history of robots.

------------------------------
[1.1] What is the definition of a 'robot'?
	A reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move
material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through various
programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks"

				Robot Institute of America, 1979

Obviously, this was a committee-written definition. It's rather dry and
uninspiring. Better ones for 'robotics' might include:

	Force through intelligence.
	Where AI meet the real world.

Webster says:
	An automatic device that performs functions normally ascribed
	to humans or a machine in the form of a human.

------------------------------
[1.2] Where did the word 'robot' come from?

The word 'robot' was coined by the Czech playwright Karel Capek
(pronounced "chop'ek") from the Czech word for forced labor or serf.
Capek was reportedly several times a candidate for the Nobel prize for
his works and very influential and prolific as a writer and
playwright.  Mercifully, he died before the Gestapo got to him for his
anti-Nazi sympathies in 1938.

The use of the word Robot was introduced into his play R.U.R.
(Rossum's Universal Robots) which opened in Prague in January 1921.
The play was an enormous success and productions soon opened
throughout Europe and the US. R.U.R's theme, in part, was the
dehumanization of man in a technological civilization. You may find it
surprising that the robots were not mechanical in nature but were
created through chemical means. In fact, in an essay written in 1935,
Capek strongly fought that this idea was at all possible and, writing
in the third person, said:

	"It is with horror, frankly, that he rejects all
	responsibility for the idea that metal contraptions could ever
	replace human beings, and that by means of wires they could
	awaken something like life, love, or rebellion. He would deem
	this dark prospect to be either an overestimation of machines,
	or a grave offence against life."

	[The Author of Robots Defends Himself - Karl Capek, Lidove
	noviny, June 9, 1935, translation: Bean Comrada]

There is some evidence that the word robot was actually coined by
Karl's brother Josef, a writer in his own right. In a short letter,
Capek writes that he asked Josef what he should call the artifical
workers in his new play. Karel suggests Labori, which he thinks too
'bookish' and his brother mutters "then call them Robots" and turns
back to his work, and so from a curt response we have the word robot.

R.U.R is found in most libraries. The most common English translation
is that of P. Selver from the 1920's which is not completely faithful
to the original. A more recent and accurate translation is in a
collection of Capek's writings called Towards the Radical Center
published by Catbird Press in North Haven, CT. tel: 203.230.2391

The term 'robotics' refers to the study and use of robots. The term
was coined and first used by the Russian-born American scientist and
writer Isaac Asimov (born Jan. 2, 1920, died Apr. 6, 1992). Asimov
wrote prodigiously on a wide variety of subjects. He was best known
for his many works of science fiction.  The most famous include I
Robot (1950), The Foundation Trilogy (1951-52), Foundation's Edge
(1982), and The Gods Themselves (1972), which won both the Hugo and
Nebula awards. 

The word 'robotics' was first used in Runaround, a short story published in
1942. I, Robot, a collection of several of these stories, was
published in 1950.

Asimov also proposed his three "Laws of Robotics", and he later added
a 'zeroth law'.

	-Law Zero: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction,
		allow humanity to come to harm.

	-Law One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction,
		allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would
		violate a higher order law.

	-Law Two: (a) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings,
		except where such orders would conflict with a higher order
		law.

	-Law Three: A robot mus protect its own existence
		as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher
		order law.

An interesting article on this subject:

	Clarke, Roger, "Asimov's Laws for Robotics: Implications for
	Information Technology", Part 1 and Part 2, Computer, December
	1993, pp. 53-61 and Computer, January 1994, pp.57-65.

The article is an interesting discussion of his Laws and how they came
to be in his books, and the implications for technology today and in
the future.

------------------------------
[1.3] When did robots, as we know them today, come into existence?

The first industrial modern robots were the Unimates developed by
George Devol and Joe Engleberger in the late 50's and early 60's. The
first patents were by Devol for parts transfer machines. Engleberger
formed Unimation and was the first to market robots.  As a result,
Engleberger has been called the 'father of robotics.'

Modern industrial arms have increased in capability and performance
through controller and language development, improved mechanisms,
sensing, and drive systems. In the early to mid 80's the robot
industry grew very fast primarily due to large investments by the
automotive industry. The quick leap into the factory of the future
turned into a plunge when the integration and economic viability of
these efforts proved disastrous. The robot industry has only recently
recovered to mid-80's revenue levels. In the mean time there has been
an enormous shakeout in the robot industry. In the US, for example,
only one US company, Adept, remains in the production industrial robot
arm business. Most of the rest went under, consolidated, or were sold
to European and Japanese companies.

In the research community the first automata were probably Grey
Walter's machina (1940's) and the John's Hopkins beast. Teleoperated
or remote controlled devices had been built even earlier with at least
the first radio controlled vehicles built by Nikola Tesla in the
1890's. Tesla is better known as the inventor of the induction motor,
AC power transmission, and numerous other electrical devices. Tesla
had also envisioned smart mechanisms that were as capable as humans.
An excellent biography of Tesla is Margaret Cheney's Tesla, man out of
time, Published by Prentice-Hall, c1981.

SRI's Shakey navigated highly structured indoor environments in the
late 60's and Moravec's Stanford Cart was the first to attempt natural
outdoor scenes in the late 70's. From that time there has been a
proliferation of work in autonomous driving machines that cruise at
highway speeds and navigate outdoor terrains in commercial
applications.

[3] Robotics Organizations
	There are a number of organizations and societies related to
robotics. Some are related specifically to industry, several to
academia and a number of hobbyist groups. In addition, a number of the
groups, such as the ASME or IEEE, (see below) are very large
organizations and robotics is one of many sub-disciplines in their
respective fields. Many of these organizations also have periodicals

	SPIE has publications, meetings and conferences in the field
of intelligent robots, mobile robots, teleoperation, machine vision,
etc.
	SPIE is a nonprofit society dedicated to advancing engineering
and scientific applications of optical, electro-optical, and
optoelectronic instrumentation, systems and technology. Its members
are scientists, engineers, and users interested in the reduction to
practice of these technologies. SPIE provides the means for
communicating new developments and applications to the scientific,
engineering, and user communities through its publications, symposia,
and short courses.

SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering, has started
up four new listservers, covering robotics, fiber optics, optical
computing and processing, and optomechanical engineering/instrument
design. This brings the total to eight (see list below).

SPIE maintains several e-mail Listserver Groups dedicated to various
technical specialties. These groups are a way for colleagues to share
information, solve problems, and discuss issues related to their
interests. While the topics are tied to the various International
Technical Working Groups of SPIE, membership is not required to join a
listserver group.

Currently available e-mail listservers maintained by SPIE:
Listname        Group
--------        -----
info-bios       BiOS (Biomedical Optics Society)
info-ei         Electronic Imaging

info-adopt      Adaptive Optics
info-fibers     Fiber Optics
info-opcom      Optical Computing and Processing
info-robo       Robotics
info-optomech   Optomechanical and Instrument Design

To subscribe to one of these groups, send an e-mail message to
   info-optolink-request@mom.spie.org
and include the words:   subscribe info-listname
in the message body area, where listname matches one of the names
listed above. For a complete set of instructions, send a message to

[3.3] Robotics Clubs

The original computer club in Silicon Valley was the Homebrew computer
club, out of which evolved a major portion of the personal computer
industry. In that spirit, if not the hope for history repeating
itself, a number of robotics societies and clubs have sprung up.

	Survival Research Laboratories is a not-for-profit machine-
performance art group conceived of and founded by Mark Pauline in
November 1978.  Since its inception SRL has operated as an
organization of creative technicians dedicated to re-directing the
techniques, tools, and tenets of industry, science, and the military
away from their typical manifestations in practicality, product or
warfare.  Since 1979, SRL has staged over 45 mechanized presentations
in the United States and Europe.  Each performance consists of a
unique set of ritualized interactions between machines, robots, and
special effects devices, employed in developing themes of
socio-political satire.  Humans are present only as audience or
operators.

	Survival Research Laboratories is now available for email and
time-restricted Gopher and anonymous FTP access from 0000-0600 PST
daily. [NOTE TIME RESTRICTION!]: <A NAME=id31 HREF="ftp://srl.org/pub/SRLImageBank">ftp://srl.org/pub/SRLImageBank</A> and

------------------------------
[4.1] Magazines, Journals, Newsletters
	There are a number of academic journals and trade magazines
devoted to robotics.  There are no magazines currently devoted to the
hobbyist or designer of robotic mechanisms. In the 1980's Robotics
Engineering (nee Robotics Age) lasted for 7-8 years but folded. The
one difficulty I noted as a subscriber was that the magazine attempted
to address the hobbyist, the curious and those whose work was devoted
to robotics without successfully catering to all groups.

-----
[4.1.1] Robotics Publications

This list of periodical covers the academic journals, the trade
magazines devoted to both robotics and relevant sub-areas, and the
lone newsletter for hobbyists.

Carnegie Mellon University SCS Technical Reports
1) The machine reports@cs.cmu.edu is the offical SCS machine for
   ftping SCS technical reports. Directories containing .ps files
   (compressed and uncompressed, dependent on size) are stored for
   ease of access. You can use the instructions below to browse the
   directories.

2) The reports appearing in our ftpable directories are also automatically
   transferred into MOSAIC. Authors retain the right to decide whether
   their report(s) should or should not appear in the public ftp
   directories/MOSAIC.  

3) A third mechanism for storing and making reports available is
   MERCURY--the scanned image, full text, online database (part of the
   LIS system). Whether the report is scanned into the system is again
   left up to invidivual author choice.  The CMU community is able to
   view text for the reports, as they appear, at their desks using
   Mercury.  This system, supported by ARPA and CNRI, will open soon
   to MIT, Stanford, Cornell, and Berkeley...so we can all share online
   text of reports.  Down the road, it is anticipated that more and
   more universities will become a part of this service.  We scan 
   original copies of reports into the system,

   DIRECTIONS FOR ANONYMOUS FTP:
        URL: <A NAME=id43 HREF="ftp://reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu/">ftp://reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu/</A> or

   The reports are in postscript format (.ps).  The index file
   is called README.mss.  The reports are listed in the directory
   by their NUMBER.ps...for example, CMU-CS-92-100.ps, CMU-CS-92-101.ps
   and so on.  The majority of the files are not compressed, although
   any compressed files will be listed as NUMBER.ps.Z .  A very few
   reports have been broken down into multiple postscript files.  They
   will appear as NUMBERA.ps, NUMBERB.ps, etc.  The README.mss will
   indicate the reports that have multiple .ps files.

Abstract:
Recent experimental and analytical evidence indicates that direct drive
robots become very practical and economical at miniature and
microscopic scales, so it is interesting to understand quantitatively
the properties of direct drive robots under scaling transformations.  This
leads to a study of  how screws and their dual co-screws behave under the group
of similarity transforms.  This group is the group of isometries
together with dilations.  Several different representations are found
on the space of screws and complementary representations are found on 
the dual space of co-screws.  From the electromagnetic theory
of the force and torque on a magnet in a magnetic field, we derive the
scaling properties of the electromagnetic wrench.  Hence, these
results can be directly applied to the scaling of direct drive motors.
We conclude by proposing a scale-invariant measure for direct drive 
actuator performance.
