 [11] What's available for Heathkit Hero Robots?

 Heath/Heathkit/Zenith [OUT OF BUSINESS]
 Benton Harbor, MI
 order: 800.253.0570 (At last report these numbers do not work)
 tech:  616.982.3980

 Heros are no longer being made but Heath (Zenith) still offers some
 replacement parts.  They had about 8 years of sales: 4,000 Hero Jr's,
 3,000 Hero 2000's, 14,000 assembled Hero 1's. Ones with less
 capability didn't do as well but higher priced ones did ok in the
 market. Service and maintainability are a problem due to the sheer
 number of bolts, pulleys, boards, sensors, cables etc. Used ones can
 be picked up cheap - but caveat emptor.

There is a mailing group for hero owners managed by Dave Goodwin: 
	&#60;Hero-owners-request@smcvax.smcvt.edu&#62;
Send the following command in the message body:
	Subscribe Hero-owners

You may also want to include a HELP command line to get the commands
and their syntax.  Note that the subject on the message is irrelevant.
Of course, to post a message to the group, just send it to hero-owners
at the same host.

The Mailserv software can handle files as well, but none are currently
available.  Hopefully, list subscribers will start to provide any
nifty code they write for the archive.

Finally, the list of subscribers is available from the Mailserv.  See
the help file for how to get it.  Questions or problems should be
addressed to Goodwin@smcvax.smcvt.edu, not at the waldo address.

[12] What's available for Puma Manipulators?

 Pumas are probably the most common robot in university laboratories
 and one of the most common assembly robots. Designed by Vic Schienman
 and financed by GM at MIT in the mid-70's, the Puma (Programmable
 Universal Machine for Assembly) was produced for many years by
 Unimation (later purchased by Westinghouse and sold at a loss later to
 Staubli, a Swiss company) Found in many university labs as well.

 PUMA singularities:
 The PUMA has three singularities: the ``alignment'' singularity (wrist
 is as close to the axis of joint 1 as it can get), the ``elbow''
 singularity (elbow is fully extended or folded up; the latter is not
 possible because of joint limits), and the wrist singularity (the axes
 of joints 4 and 6 are aligned).

 The angles corresponding to these depend on the Denavit-Hartenburg
 (DH) parameter assignment.  For the PUMA, the definitions given in [1]
 are perhaps the most commonly used Using these, and letting A2, A3,
 D3, and D4 denote the translational DH offsets, the singularities
 occur when the following are true:

 Alignment:	D4*sin(ang2+ang3) + A2*cos(ang2) - A3*cos(ang2+ang3) == 0

 Elbow:		sin(ang3 - atan2(A3,D4)) == 0

 Wrist:		sin(ang5) == 0

 Typical offset values for the PUMA 560 are

 A2 =  431.80
 D3 =  149.09
 A3 =  20.32
 D4 =  433.070

Tech Report and Matlab Toolbox [Peter Corke]

 A technical report is available which provides details of the
Unimation Puma servo system, including details of interfacing via the
arm-interface board, digital board firmware, and analog board/motor
dynamics. (54 pages) It can be found at
<A NAME=id HREF="ftp://asgard.mlb.dmt.csiro.au/pub/pic/mtm226.ps.Z">ftp://asgard.mlb.dmt.csiro.au/pub/pic/mtm226.ps.Z</A>

A Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB which provides functions for homogeneous
transformations, quaternions, forward and inverse kinematics,
trajectories, forward and inverse dynamics, and graphical animation.
The Toolbox uses a very general method of describing the kinematics
and dynamics of any serial-link manipulators.  Descriptors for the
Unimate Puma 560 and the Stanford arm are included.  Location -

 A board for replacing the PUMA LSI/11 controller with the CPU of your
 choice: The board is basically an I/O board with D/A's, A/D's, encoder
 counters and some digital I/O lines and is available to connect to
 several bus architectures including VMEbus, IBM-PC bus, Multibus and
 IndustryPack bus. (with others under consideration) It comes as a
 two-board set: A PUMA board and a bus interface board. This allows
 several buses to be supported and keeps the analog electronics away
 from the noise of the bus. (It also makes switching buses cheap, if
 the need ever arises.) Since it is primarily an I/O board set, it can
 be used in applications other than controlling a PUMA.

 The user's manuals are available by anonymous ftp:
<A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/anon/user/deadslug/trc4um.ps">ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/anon/user/deadslug/trc4um.ps</A> and trd0002.ps

 This is a PostScript file that can be printed or viewed (to conserve
 paper) and describes the remote board that mounts inside the Unimate
 controller, replacing the VAL computer.  The file trd0001.ps shows
 the board arrangement diagrammatically.

[13]  What kinds of Robotics Simulators are there?


Simulation allows researchers, designers and users to construct robots
and task environments for a fraction of the cost and time of real
systems. They differ significantly from traditional CAD tools in that
they allow study of geometries, kinematics, dynamics and motion
planning. This list is NOT a comparative analysis of the different
systems but rather a list of systems that are available.

	ADAMS is a general purpose dynamics simulator: it can be used
to simulate any mechanism. You input the model you want to simulate,
and ADAMS builds the system of equations, and solves it through
time. You can do kinematic, static, quasi-static and dynamic
simulations. And then, you can study the results (forces,
accelerations and so on).

	It has a good graphical interface, although it's non-standard
(it doesn't use OpenLook or Motif, but it's own windowing system). But
if you want to study something not very common, you will have to deal
with the text interface, and perhaps Fortran programming. It's not
very easy to learn.

Robot Simulations (RSL) develops and markets the world's first
microcomputer based industrial robot simulation software named
Workspace.  The package has been selling since 1989. The package uses
3d graphics to simulate robots and their associated machinery in a
workcell, and is capable of offline programming industrial and
educational robots in many different robot languages. It runs on a PC
and is $5K to educational institutions. $26K for industrial version.

[13.2] Sharware and Freeware Simulators
	Many university groups and individuals have developed
simulators for their own work and made them available via the net.

Ars Magna:
   The ARS MAGNA robot simulator provides an abstract world in which a
   planner controls a mobile robot. The simulator also includes a simple
   graphical user-interface which uses the CLX interface to the X window
   system. Version 1.0 of the ARS MAGNA simulator is documented in Yale
   Technical Report YALEU/DCS/RR #928, "ARS MAGNA: The Abstract Robot
   Simulator".  This report is available in the distribution as a
   Postscript(tm) file, as well as from:

EROS [Erann's RObot Simulator]:
	EROS is a mobile robot simulator.  Unlike other simulators,
EROS does not simulate any particular robot.  Instead, EROS is a sort
of robot simulation construction kit.  It is designed to allow users
to assemble their own robots from reusable software components, and to
run those robots in user-designed environments.  EROS draws
inspiration from Hanks and Firby's truckworld simulator, but EROS
operates at a lower level of abstraction than truckworld, and so it is
by some measure more realistic.  EROS has been used to simulate actual
physical robots, and the behavior produced by EROS has, in some cases,
made plausible predictions and accurate postdictions of the behaviors
of the real robots.

NOTE: This is a beta-test version of EROS.  It runs only under
Macintosh Common Lisp version 2.0.  Many of its features have not been
tested (although it has been used in a few applications, so parts of
it work quite well!) and the documentation is not very coherent.

EROS is available by anonymous ftp at:
	<A NAME=id4 HREF="ftp://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov:pub/gat/eros.sit.hqx">ftp://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov:pub/gat/eros.sit.hqx</A>

	This is an early version for beta testing only.  It runs only
under MCL 2.0.  It will not run under any other version of Common
Lisp, including MCL 1.3.  (EROS relies heavily on Macintosh graphics
and CLOS.)  It also includes only a single example robot, so out of
the box it doesn't do very much.  You have to be willing to do a
little hacking to use it as it currently stands.  A future release
will have more turnkey functionality, but it's pretty much an OEM
product at this point.

Flakey:
	A mobile robot simulator and controller. Contact: Kurt
Konolige of SRI &#60;konolige@ai.sri.com&#62; A Preliminary version of a
mobile robot simulator and controller.  All written in C, but you need
Motif to run the graphics.

This is essentially the same software run on Flakey, (robot at SRI
used for research in AI), behaviors using fuzzy control (there's lots
more on Flakey in terms of sensor interpretation and higher-level
control, but I haven't ported that from LISP to C yet).  There are
three example behaviors implemented, showing dumb obstacle avoidance
and goal achievement. There's not much documentation yet, but I will
get some out over the next few months.

The intent is to make the simulator/controller suitable for a course
in mobile robotics, and to have eventually a cheap physical platform
that will imitate the simulator (or vice versa).

Simderella 2.0

Version 2.0 of simderella is here.  Major adaptations:
	- now features Imakefiles;
	- compiles &#38; runs on Solaris and DEC Alpha;
	- some C bugs squashed;
	- bemmel can grab robot with mouse;
	- major improvements to documentation (i.e., an introductory
	  article describing the package).
	- includes a stand-alone version of bemmel for drawing
	  geometrical objects, with viewoint rotation.  Figures
	  can be dumped to xfig for later inclusion in your papers.

   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs:
	 connel: the controller
	 simmel: the simulator
	 bemmel: the X-windows oriented graphics back-end
   Simmel is the part which actually simulates the robot. It performs a
   few matrix multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method,
   calculates velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates
   with the other two programs.

   Bemmel only displays the robot. It is a fast general-purpose
   display method which places separate objects in space depending on
   the homogeneous matrices it receives from simmel.

   Connel is the controller, which must be designed by the user
   (in the distributed version, connel is a simple inverse kinematics
   routine. I didn't include my neural networks.)

   The three programs use Unix sockets for communication.  This means
   that
	 1. you need sockets
	 2. all the programs can run on different machines
   Since data communication is high-level (meaning, in this case, that
   I do not send doubles, integers, and so on, but encode them first),
   running the programs on different architectures is no problem.  In
   fact, it was thus designed that connel can, at the same time,
   control a real robot _and_ the simulated one.

   Simderella likes to sleep; that is, when nothing happens, no
   processor time will be used.

   The software is available as a compressed tar file from:
	 site:		galba.mbfys.kun.nl [IP 131.174.82.73]
	 directory: 	pub/neuro-software/pd
	 filename:	simderella.1.0.tar.Z

   Extract the simulator from the tar file by typing at the Unix
   command line:
	 zcat simderella.2.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
   or use your favourite extracting commands. In the simderella/
   directory, type
	xmkmf
	make Makefiles
	make depend
	make
   The sub-directories are recursively visited and executables are
   compiled and linked.

   Supported architectures: Sun (SunOS and Solaris), SGI, DEC Alpha,
   HP700, 386 et al running Linux)

   If you're impatient, execute the thing as follows:
	 cd bemmel; Zoscar &#38; cd ..
	 cd simmel; source env; simmel1 ns &#38; cd ..
	 cd connel; connel s
   all on one machine.  Then type commands like
	 fix-target 50 50 50
	 inverse 50 50 50
   or move the mouse pointer in the bemmel window and press an `l' or
   `r' or `u' or `d' or ....

   [CMU ised Simderella recently to facilitate software development
   and testing of the Shuttle servicing robot before the hardware and
   mechanics are available to test the various parts of the controller.
   it has also been linked to TCA calls and worked very well - nivek]

Public Domain SGI based simulator:
	 This is a Silicon Graphics based delux robot simulator with
   lots of graphics Stuff. It was written by Andrew Conway and
   Craig Dillon as undergraduates for an electrical engineering project
   at the University of Melbourne. Not much in installation
   instructions. There is a latex manual with usage instructions and
   the mathematics.  Warning: It is 4.3Mbytes compressed, and the
   US-Australia link is quite slow.
	 Disclaimer: I [Andrew] haven't used this software for
   years. If it malfunctions, don't sue me or Craig, we don't guarantee
   it.

   reducing the scale and passing to the two dimensional drawing window
   from the three dimensional one are available.
	 The Drawing Menu also offers many other possibilities like
   drawing three dimensional circles, ellipses, arcs, elliptical arcs,
   cylinders, cones, prisms, ellipsoids, toroids, etc.  In addition to
   these, it is also possible to obtain hidden line drawing and to
   change the point numbers of the circular drawing elements.  Whereas
   in Robots Menu, operations like selecting modules from the
   sub-menus, containing graphics, which concern body, wrist, hand
   systems and work spaces of robots, finding direct and inverse
   kinematics solution of these systems, point by point simulation of
   the robot motions, changing Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and joint
   freedom extremums from the menus can be performed.

Robotica is a trademark of The Board of Trustees of the University of
Illinois

Robotica is a collection of useful robotics problem solving functions
encapsulated in a Mathematica package.  Utilizing Mathematica's
computational features allows results to be generated in purely
symbolic form.

Robotica requires inputing the form of a table of Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters describing the robot to be analyzed.  Once the table has
been entered, Robotica can generate the forward kinematics for the
robot. The A and T matrices as well as the velocity Jacobian, J, are
generated. Of course, it is possible to display and save to an
external file all of the data generated.  If the dynamics equations of
the robot are also to be generated, the input must include the
dynamics description data.

Once the forward kinematics are produced, Euler-Lagrange dynamics
equations can be calculated.  The inertia matrix, Coriolis and
centrifugal terms, Christoffel symbols and gravity vectors are all
available to the user once the dynamics routines have run.

Utilizing the forward kinematics results, Robotica can calculate the
manipulability ellipsoids when supplied with a range of joint variable
values. It is possible to generate and save a list of manipulability
measures as well as display the ellipsoids with the robot on the
screen.

In addition, Robotica has the capbability of reading external
simulation (e.g., SIMNON) output files and displaying the motion of
the robot when sbjected to the sequence of joint variables described
in the file. This requires that the robot has been input as a table of
Denavit-Hartenburg parameters, and that the foward-kinematics routines
have been executed.

Robotics contains several functions that can be used to draw the robot
in a specific configuration, or show the robot moving through a range
of joint parameter values. Most of the graphics output can be animated
if the Animation.m package is loaded The animations can be saved and
later restored and viewed again.

To simplify interactation with Robotica, an X-Windows based interface
has been designed. This interface insulates the user from the
inconvenient textual interface Mathematica provides.

Requirements: Mathematica 2.0 or better. X-windows requires 2.1 or
better.

The University has requested that all users of Robotica sign and
return a license agreement.  This is mainly to keep a record of
Robotica users for future upgrades, etc.  The license agreement states
that you may freely use and modify Robotica as you wish but that you
may not sell it.

You can obtain a postscript copy of this license agreement via
anonymous <A NAME=id9 HREF="ftp://ftp.csl.uiuc.edu/pub/robotica">ftp://ftp.csl.uiuc.edu/pub/robotica</A>.  Please print out the
license agreement, sign and date it, and FAX it to me [Mark Spong]

It is important that you also include your email address on the
license agreement.  As soon as I receive your FAX I will send you the 
Robotica package and the X-windows GUI.   

Also in the directory /pub/robotica is a postscript file containing 
the Robotica users manual which you may freely copy and distribute.  
Any comments that you have after using Robotica would be greatly 
appreciated.  In addition, any questions you have or bugs you find 
can be reported to me and we will do our best to address them.

[13.2.1] What is NuTank?

NuTank stands for NeuralTank. It is a program to simulate complex
networks and interactions. In this program one is given the shell of a
2 dimensional robotic tank.  The tank has various I/O devices like
wheels, whiskers, optical sensors, smell, fuel level, sound and such.
These I/O sensors are connected to Neurons.  The player/designer uses
more Neurons to interconnect the I/O devices.  One can have any level
of complexity desired (640k memory limited) and do subsumptive
designs. More complex design take slightly more fuel, so life is not
free. All movement costs fuel too.  One can also tag neuron
connections as "adaptable" that adapt their weights in accordance with
the target neuron. This allows neurons to learn.

The Neuron editor can handle 3 dimensional arrays of neurons as single
entities with very flexible interconnect patterns.  One can also design
a Glyph or drawing to represent the robot and/or obstacle.  (or bug,
worm, whatever) One can then design a scenario with walls, rocks, fat
(fuel) sources (that can be smelled) and many other such things.

Robot tanks are then introduced into the Scenario and allowed to interact
or battle it out.  The last one alive wins, or maybe one just watches
the motion of the robots for fun.  While the scenario is running it
can be stopped, edited, zoom'd, and can track on any robot. One can
designate a neuron group as the probe group and get a display of the
neural activity of that group.  This helps debug designs.

The entire program is mouse and graphically based. It uses DOS and VGA
and is written in TurboC++

There will also be the ability to download designs to another computer
and source code will be available for the core neural simulator.  This
will allow one to design neural systems and download them to real
robots.  This feature may be in the Beta release, around August 94.
The design tools can handle three dimensional networks so will work
with video camera inputs and such.

Eventually I expect to do a port to UNIX and multi thread the program.
I also expect to do a Mac port and maybe NT or OS/2

The theory that I eventually want to test has to do with the self
oscillating nature of combined subsumptive and standard neural
nets. One can also work on flock and pack behavior.

I have a paper I've written called Artificial Cognition that discusses
a theory of the combination of regular neural nets and subsumptive
networks.  In the shareware file it is called Paper.ps and will need
to be printed on a PostScript printer.  You may get copies of it by
sending $5 to Keene Educational Software.

Getting NuTank:
	NuTank now has a shareware version.  It is about 300k bytes compressed.
	The file is nutank.exe and is a PKZip executable for dos machines.
	It must be put in a directory called C:\nutank

	To unpack nutank firts put nutank.exe in C:
	C:
	mkdir nutank
	cd nutank
	..\nutank.exe -d

	After it unpacks
	nutank.exe  is the program

	If anyone would like to put it on their server feel free to do
so. If you put the shareware on your sever please tell me so I can
send you updates.

	Nutank shareware is available vie the ftp sites
	<A NAME=id10 HREF="ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/incomming/NuTank">cher.media.mit.edu:/pub/incomming/NuTank</A>
	or
	<A NAME=id11 HREF="ftp://ftp.essex.ac.uk/robot/Simulators/NuTank">ftp.essex.ac.uk:/robot/Simulators/NuTank</A>

The shareware version has the ability to write to disk disabled.  Feel
free to pass the shareware version around.  The regular version costs
$50 (includes a printed copy of the paper) and can be had by sending
$50 US to

                [17.3] What is the Bot Board?

-----------------------------
[17.1] What is the Miniboard?

New version: Miniboard 2.1 extended -

 The Mini Board is an outgrowth of the MIT 6.270 robot course and
 design project. It is a small and inexpensive design for a controller
 board based on the ubiquitous (yet sometimes hard to find) 68HC11
 micro-controller.

The Mini Board 2.1 Extended is the latest version of the Mini Board.
It is based on the Mini Board 2.0 Extended (see file
pub/miniboard/docs/mbextend.txt), and includes the following new
features: 

    *   full six-wire SPI jacks include power, ground, and all four
SPI wires.

    *   optional diode protection prevents reverse-polarity voltage
input when using DC power jack.

    *   power and ground on Port A headers may be bridged to motor
power and ground, allowing RC servos to be plugged directly into the
Port A header (when using a 5.5 to 6v power supply).

    *   extra space between PLCC socket and female header connectors
to allow for newer, slightly larger PLCC sockets.

    *   mounting holes drilled for single RJ11 jack (for RS-232
serial), saving money on triple RJ11 jack if SPI ports are not to be
used.

Download the file pub/miniboard/docs/mb21ext.PS.Z to see the
silkscreen of the new board.  

The MINI BOARD 2.1 is a complete embedded computer board for robotic
applications.  It can directly power four DC motors and receive inputs
from numerous sensors.  Its miniature size (smaller than a business
card) makes it suited well for mobile applications as well as other
embedded control.

It can be programmed in 6811 assembler code or C for stand-alone
operation, or it can serve as a serial-line based controller operated
by a desktop computer.

  * overall dimensions: 3.3" by 1.86", smaller than a business card.
    If desired, an off-board serial connector can be used, allowing an
    additional .6" of board length can be chopped off. 

  * nearly all parts can be purchased from Digikey (including all
    connectors and switches).  Extensive use of resistor packs 
    minimizes component count.

  * uses Motorola 68hc811e2 microprocessor with 2048 bytes of
    internal, electrically erasable PROM and 256 bytes of RAM.

  * four motor drivers for bidirectional control of small DC motors
    (up to 600 mA current, 36 volts each motor).

  * eight analog inputs; eight digital inputs or outputs; several
    timer and counter I/O pins, all broken out to convenient header
    ports. 

  * on-board 5v regulator allows board to be powered by any DC power
    source from 5.6 to 36 volts.

  * RS-232 compatible RJ-11 port for communication/program download
    between host computer.

  * two modular high speed serial jacks, allowing networks of multiple
    MB 2.0's to be constructed using common 4-wire phone cable.
    Multiple-mastering bus protocols supported.

  * optional battery level monitoring using voltage divider from
    supply voltage before regulation.

  * XIRQ line broken out to a pad:  when this line is given 12.5v,
    an 'hc711e9 chip with 12K of EPROM can be programmed in place.

  * MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Unix software provided for downloading
    programs to board.  6811 monitor program provided for recording
    changes in sensor state, controlling motors and interacting with
    other board features over serial line.

  * C/assembler libraries provided for code development using
    Dunfield Development Systems' Micro-C compiler, and ImageCraft's
    freeware icc11 C compiler.

 A fifty-page manual describing how to build and operate the Mini Board
 is on-line on the FTP server:

[18] What is the XXX Microcontroller?

 Which microcontroller should I use and what are the differences
 between them? What about motor controllers and motor drivers?

There are a wide variety of microcontrollers that can be used in
robotics projects. Some of the most popular are 6811's (Miniboard and
many single board computers), 80186, and PIC's. This topic engenders
hot debates of the merit of one chip over the other. Therefore, the
best way for you to decide is to understand your problem requirements
and see which devices fit your needs. At that point, you can look at
issues of support platforms, cross-compilers, cost etc to make the
best decision.

-----
Basically there are three kinds of "boards" out there that are of interest
to design engineers and the definitions are necessarily broad:

 1) The evaluation board. This is a board designed by the manufacturer
    of a part to demonstrate its features. Using such a board a DE can
    decide whether the part will meet their needs for the design they
    are creating. Generally somewhat expensive (because they are
    produced in relatively small numbers) except when the part is
    being 'pushed' by the manufacturer and there is some sort of
    promotional deal going on. Often the evaluation board will have
    some sort of breadboard area on the board for custom circuitry.

 2) The Single Board Computer or SBC. These are generally produced
    by a third party using some manufacturers chip. The are generally
    pretty flexible but may not 'expose' all features. SBCs come in
    all sizes and price ranges, some are availabe in kit form. Many
    have development tools available for them.

 3) The Embedded processor. These are generally boards dedicated to
    some particular function (like driving a stepper motor, running
    a modem etc) and are usually available pretty cheaply on the
    surplus market. Unlike SBCs there are rarely any design tools
    available to use with them but they can be quite inexpensive.

      Maintainer:  Russ Hersch &#60;sibit@datasrv.co.il&#62;

------------------------------
[18.1] Motorola 68XX
	 A 68HC11 is an 8-bit data, 16-bit address microcontroller from
 Motorola, with an instruction set similar to the older 68xx (6801,
 6805, 6809) parts.  It has several on-chip resources including digital
 I/O, timers, PWM, A/D RAM, various types of ROM, and synchronous and
 asynchronous communications channels (RS-232 and SPI). It can easily
 be integrated into single-chip applications. Less than 20ma current
 draw. Good freeware assembly-language tools are available, as well as
 several good commercial C compilers. It is widely used because it is
 very inexpensive and the availability of developments tools makes it
 very attractive.

	 Moto nows offers an evaluation kit that includes DOS and Mac
 compatible software, low-power design tutorial and extensive technical
 literature. M68EBLPIIKIT has batteries included and has 68HC11E9
 microcontroller, LCD display, Moto LCD driver, RS232 line
 driver/receiver chips, wire-wrap area for custom work, simple
 development platform and development code. Includes assembler, several
 examples, and extra crystals. $199.11 through 4/22/94.

 The FAQ is also regularly posted to several newsgroups.

To subscribe to a listserv mailing list for 68HC11's send the following

	subscribe mc68hc11 &#60;your name here&#62;

There is also a FAQ on news:comp.sys.m68k.  This FAQ covers the
Motorola M680x0 and the MC68300 series of microprocessors.  There are
sections on the VME bus and PowerPC parts.  Sources for software for
all Motorola products including the HC11 series is included.  This
list also points to resources provided by Motorola to its customers.
Much of this FAQ is applicable to parts other than the M68K.

[18.2] Motorola 683xx

	The 683xx family from Moto are highly integrated CPU's.
Several have onboard RAM (eg, up to 2K), none have on-board ROM, but
they do have timers, software programmable chip selects, etc, making
it possible to build very small but complete systems.

68302: Designed for communications, especially ISDN. On-board
        nice serial controller. 68000 CPU, some memory.
68330: Has CPU32, which is in between a 68000 and a 68020.  Not much else.
68331: Add standard async serial controller.
68332: Add separate Time Processing Unit and some RAM.  The TPU can do
	things like off-line PWM processing. Nice general package.
68340: Delete TPU, add DMA controller.

[18.3] Intel 80C186

	 An 80C186 is a evolution from the 8086. It is an embedded
processor sold by Intel, and has the same instruction set as the 8086,
with the additional "real-mode" instructions of the 286. It has the
same 16-bit data and 20-bit address bus structure of the 8086.  The
80C188 is an 8-bit data bus version, just like the 8088 (of PC &#38; PC/XT
fame).  For embedded systems, it is much easier to use than the 8086.
	It has an on-chip timer system, interrupt controller, DMA
controller, and clock generator.  For DRAM operation, it also has an
integrated DRAM refresh generator.  However, it has no on-chip I/O,
nor does it have any memory on-chip.  There is, however, extra
circuitry for selecting external memory with a minimum of extra logic.
Can be programmed using most DOS compilers and assemblers, but
requires a linker that knows about locating code in absolute memory.
	The '186 is not as accessible; it is harder to set up, the
tools cost more, and robotics &#38; control resources have to be added
externally.  The timers can be configured for PWM or pulse timing, It
does, however, run at higher speeds, have more accessible memory, and
can be hooked up to a floating-point co-processor (C187).  It looks a
lot like a DOS machine. This may be important when software is run on
multiple platforms and also helps with the learning curve.

------------------------------
[18.4] Intel 8051

   A typical 8051 contains:
       - CPU with boolean processor
       - 5 or 6 interrupts: 2 external, 2 priority levels
       - 2 or 3 16-bit timer/counters
       - programmable full-duplex serial port
         (baud rate provided by one of the timers)
       - 32 I/O lines (four 8-bit ports)
       - RAM and ROM/EPROM in some models

The 8051 and varients are now sourced by more than a half-dozen
companies including Intel, AMD, Dallas, Signetics, Siemans and others.

It includes 8051 ftp sites, public domain langauges, commercially
available software and publications for the 8051.

[18.5] Intel 8096

It is 16 bit, many registers, internal RAM, the usual compliment of
on-board peripherals (serial, A/D, pwm, timer/counters, etc)

	MEL has designed a couple of PC boards for prototyping PIC
systems PICProto 18 - $9.95 US including shipping in the US.  This
board is 1.5" by 3", double sided, solder masked, and has plated
through holes. the top 7/8" x 1.5" of the board (oriented with the
narrow side "up") consists of an 18 pin socket print, holes to
conviently mount either a crystal or RC oscillator and a set of holes
to mount a 5v regulator, either the TO-220 type or the low power TO-92
type as used on the Miniboard.  All of the PIC I/O pins, RB0 - 7, RA0
- 3, RTC, Vdd and Gnd are brought out to a dual row of pads. they are
followed by 15 rows of pads, with the outer pad on one side being the
Vdd bus and the outer pad on the other side being the Vcc bus. After
this there are two rows of pads, offset, that can accomodate a DB9,
DB15, or DB25 connector. This board will accept either the 16C5x
series (in the 18 pin package) or a 16C71 PIC.

The PICProto Dual - $14.95 US
	Is similar except it has pads for 1 18 pin PIC and 1 24 pin
(or another 18 pin) PIC. It is 3" x 3" and shares all of the same
properties of the PICproto 18 with respect to setting up crystal or RC
timing for the PICs.  It has pads for 1 DB connector that is 25 pins
or less.  It adds about 50% more prototyping pads so you can put two
or three more chips on it. The nice thing about this one is that one
PIC can do asynchronous things like be a serial interface while the
other provides I/O pins and monitoring functions.

PIC Prototype-1 - $195.00 from Digikey

This gizmo is made by Depew Engineering (depew@maroon.tc.umn.edu) and
is sold by Digikey and Parallax and possibly others. It is a
breadboarding system for testing out PIC designs. If you have a
Digikey catalog you can look at the picture there, but it is basically
a circuit board with a 28/18pin ZIF socket in the upper left corner, a
9 pin DB-9 connector that is attached to a MAX232 chip to provide
RS-232 levels and a 25 pin DB-25 connector at the top center which is
wired as a "parallel" port like you might find on a PC. Continuing
across the top, now in the right hand corner there is a coaxial power
plug and switch. Along the right side are five 7 segment displays that
are permanently wired to display the value of PORTA, PORTB, and PORTC
(when available) in hex notation, along the lower right are a set of
dip switches for setting the clock rate (500Khz - 32 Mhz in 32Khz
increments). Along the bottom edge are green LEDs showing the state of
all the PORT pins (in binary :-)) and taking up roughly 45% of the
circuit board is a solderless breadboard section. The solderless
breadboard has two primary sections, an upper bus section containing
connectors attached to all of the PIC pins and some useful pins on the
board (like inputs to the MAX chip and outputs from it), and a lower
section which is a standard breadboard with two rows of 5 pin
connectors spaced .3" apart.

Additionally, the circuit has support for Parallax's PBASIC
interpreter PICs and a serial EEPROM for storing your BASIC
program. (Sort of a giant BASIC STAMP). Note you have to buy a PBASIC
PIC ($18 from digikey or Parallax) separately. Overall my impression
is of a product, that does a lot of neat stuff but fails to be the
killer product it could have been. Consequently I'll first discuss the
weaknesses of the board before going on to the stronger aspects.

The board claims to be a 16c5x prototyper, but the manual suggests it
supports 16C71, and 16C84 parts as well. What it didn't do was add the
parts to make it an optional 16C84 programmer. Given how easy this is
I'm guessing that they just didn't think of it or had the design
"done" before they had access to 16C84 parts.

The next weakness is that while they have the EEPROM socket for BASIC
users, they don't bring the pins out the protoboard so it is not
possible to take advantage of the EEPROM in your prototype designs.

On the prototype board, +5/Gnd are available in the bus section on two
connectors but there aren't two strip connectors that you find on all
other breadboards for carrying Vcc and ground. This means that you end
up either daisy chaining your power and ground connections, or
dedicating some of the connectors on the main bread board for Vcc and
gnd.

Another area that could, in my opinion, be improved is the
availability of non-dedicated I/O devices, at the least it would be
nice to have a 4 position dip switch and 4 available LEDs that could
be used in the circuit as needed. A neat feature that would be by no
means required would be using two color LEDs to display the state of
the output as true (green), false (red), or floating (yellow).

Finally there is the issue of cost, at $195.00 this is a fairly pricey
system for what it does. Now I realize that similar systems for other
microcontrollers are similarly priced although the nearest direct
equivalent would be the Heathkit ET trainer series that were much more
oriented to learning about microcontrollers. IF I could program and
emulate PICs with it (like the Parallax tools do) in addition to using
it as a breadboard that would be wayyy cool, but I don't know how much
that would effect the price. I'd probably pay another $50 for that
improvement.

Ok, so all that grousing aside what did I like about it? I liked the
fact that I can now prototype PIC designs (hardware wise) in minutes
as opposed to hours. Prior to this device I would get a
MicroEngineering Labs PicProto board, wire up the PIC section,
wirewrap my I/O hardware or a connector that connected to my hardware,
and then start programming. If I had to redo the hardware that would
be fairly long delay. With this thing I can put the hardware on the
prototype strip or, using the 26 pin IDC connector, connect it over to
my "big" breadboard. I don't have to worry whether or not the PIC is
working and I can do a 10mhz design on a breadboard.

In terms of value for the money my guess is that I'll need to do at
least four and possibly six different designs on it before I've made
back my investment.

If it were part of a PIC seminar, it would be a wonderful teaching tool.

[18.7] Parallax BASIC Stamp

	The Stamp is a 1x2" (2.5x5cm) computer that runs BASIC
programs written on a PC. 8 I/O lines which can be used for serial
communications, potentiometer inputs, pulse measurement, switches,
speaker drivers etc. Usually you'll have to add no more than a
resistor or capacitor at most. A BASIC editor on the PC converts
instructions into token that are downloaded to the Stamp via a
3-conductor cable and stored in EEPROM. Whenever the Stamp is powered
up, the on-board interpreter runs the program. Battery clips are built
in for a 9V battery (Stamp has 5V supply built in.) and the Stamp has
a small prototyping area as well. From Digikey the Development Kit
(including a Stamp) is $139, and a Stamp is $39.

There is a BASIC STAMP Mailing List (NOT a newsgroup) 
	stamp-list@cybernetics.net
Subscribe to it by sending mail to
	majordomo@cybernetics.net
 with a line of text saying
	subscribe stamp-list &#60;your-real-name&#62;

There is also an FTP site at "novell.nrc.ca" that has a STAMP
directory structure. It contains (so far) all the stuff from the
Parallax BBS, plus a few other goodies.

[18.10] Motor Drivers

The L293D, motor driver on a chip, is an SGS-Thomson part and is
second sourced by Unitrode. In spite of its utility it is not readily
available in small quantities. This part is a dual full H-bridge that
can drive motors up to 0.6A.

The significance of the 'D' in L293D is that it is diode protected.
There is a reverse biased diode that shunts the reverse EMF from a
motor to the V+ supply. The L293B doesn't have this diode so it must
be provided externally.

National has an LM18293 which they say is a cross for an L293B. The
price should $4.00 or less and they need the external diodes. A
replacement for the D part is the Texas Instruments 754410 which
actually has a bit better current capacity (1A vs .6A) this latter
part is available from Arrow electronics in the US.

An alternative part is the UDN2998. This is a 3A bridge in an inline
package, it is limited to motor supplies greater than 10V. You can
also build your own H-bridge out of either bipolar chips or MOSFETs.
