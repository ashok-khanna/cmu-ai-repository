<H1>[1-15] Dynamic CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)</H1>
<PRE>
Thomas Schiex &#60;schiex@saturne.cert.fr&#62; writes: A definition: A dynamic
constraint satisfaction problem P is a sequence P_0 ... P_alpha of
static CSPs each one resulting from a change in the preceding one [1].
This change may be a _restriction_ (a new constraint is imposed on a
subset of variables) or a _relaxation_ (a constraint is removed from
the CSP).

[2] and [3] contain many references to other papers in the field.
