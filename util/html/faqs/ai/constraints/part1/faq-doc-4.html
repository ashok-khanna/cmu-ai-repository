The Journal of Functional and Logic Programming (JFLP) is a new
electronic journal that covers a broad scope of topics from functional
and logic programming. It is specially concerned with the integration
of the functional and logic paradigm as well as their common
foundations. The Journal expects articles ranging from the theoretical
foundations of functional and logic programming up to the application
of such languages ``in the real world''. The Journal is published by
The MIT Press. See either of the following URL's for more details
<A NAME=id4 HREF="http://mitpress.mit.edu/jrnls-catalog/jflp.html">http://mitpress.mit.edu/jrnls-catalog/jflp.html</A>

Various AI and Logic Programming journals are likely to have articles on
constraints, including `AI Journal'.

There is now a new journal called CONSTRAINTS, pulished by Kluwer:

 Editor-in-Chief: Eugene C. Freuder, University of New Hampshire
 (ecf@cs.unh.edu) with web page &#60;<A NAME=id6 HREF="http://www.cs.unh.edu/constraints/>">http://www.cs.unh.edu/constraints/&#62;</A>

 CONSTRAINTS will be available both as a conventional paper journal and
 in electronic form. Publication will commence in the second half of 1996.

 Aims and Scope: The journal seeks to provide a common forum for the
 many disciplines interested in constraint satisfaction and
 optimization, and the many application domains interested in employing
 constraint technology. It will cover all aspects of computing with
 constraints: theory and practice, algorithms and systems, reasoning
 and programming, logics and languages. Relevant disciplines and
 application domains include, but are not limited to:

 Disciplines

 Artificial Intelligence        
 Programming Languages     
 Operations Research  
 Combinatorial Algorithms
 Discrete Mathematics     
 Databases           
 Computational Logic     
 Symbolic Computation  
 Parallel/Distributed Computing
 Neural Networks      

 Domains

 Scheduling, Planning, Resource Allocation
 Design and Configuration
 Graphics, Visualization, Interfaces  
 Hardware Verification and Software Engineering
 Robotics, Machine Vision  and Computational Linguistics   
 Temporal and Spatial Reasoning
 Qualitative and Diagnostic Reasoning
 Human-Computer Interaction and Decision Support
 Real-Time Systems
 Molecular Biology

 Papers that cut across disciplinary lines, or that combine theory and
 practice, are especially welcome. The journal will also consider
 tutorial and survey papers.

 The Instructions for Authors can be obtained from Miss Kelly Riddle
