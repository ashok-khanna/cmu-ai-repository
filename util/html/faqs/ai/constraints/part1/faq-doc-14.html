<H1>[1-14] Interval Constraints and Newton's Approximation</H1>
<PRE>
Michael Jampel asked: Would anyone like to comment on the integration
of Newton's approximation method with interval constraint solvers?

Pascal Van Hentenryck &#60;pvh@cs.brown.edu&#62; replied: You may want to look
at our recent technical report CS-94-18:
 CLP(Intervals) Revisited
 F. Benhamou, D. McAllester, and P. Van Hentenryck
which describes precisely a smooth integration of Newton method into a
CLP(Intervals) language. The language, called Newton, was applied to
some traditional benchmarks in this area and compared with specific
tools. You may get a copy of the report by anonymous ftp from
