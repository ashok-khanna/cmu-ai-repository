Version: 1.83

[Version 1.82 was dated February 1995 when of course it should have been
Feb 1996. MBJ]

Important Changes (since last posting): &#60;minor change Rueher reference&#62;,
Constraints journal now has a web page.

Contributions and corrections should be sent to Michael Jampel
&#60;jampel@cs.city.ac.uk&#62;.

This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions (and answers) for the area
of constraints, including books, journal articles, ftp archives, and
systems &#38; products. It is posted once a month to the newsgroups
comp.constraints, comp.answers, and news.answers.

NOTE: the WWW page associated with this FAQ now contains far more
information than the FAQ does, including meta-information, i.e. pointers
to other WWW pages and ftp sites. I strongly suggest you have a look at it:
