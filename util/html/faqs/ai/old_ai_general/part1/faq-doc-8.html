Stiquito is a small (3cm H x 7cm W x 6cm L), simple (32 parts) and
inexpensive (&#60; $30) nitinol-propelled hexapod robot developed at the
Indiana University (Bloomington) Robotics Laboratory.  Its legs are
propelled by nitnol actuator wires. Each leg has one degree of freedom.
The robot walks up to 10 centimeters per minute and can carry a 9-volt
cell, a MOSIS "tiny chip" and power transistors to drive the nitinol
actuator wires. Nitinol wire (aka BioMetal, Flexinol), is a nickel-titanium
alloy which exerts useful force as it is heated by passing a current
through it. IUCS Technical Report 363a describes Stiquito's construction
and is available by anonymous ftp from 
   <A NAME=id26 HREF="ftp://cs.indiana.edu/pub/stiquito/">cs.indiana.edu:/pub/stiquito/</A> [129.79.254.191]
as are many other related files.  The tech report is also
available by US mail for $5 (checks or money orders should be made payable
to "Indiana University") from Computer Science Department, Attn: TR 363a
215, Lindley Hall, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405. A kit
containing all the materials needed to construct a simple version of
Stiquito and its controller is available for an extra $10 from the above
address (use attn line "Stiquito Kit"). To receive a video showing the
assembly of Stiquito, include an additional $10 and add "Video" to the
"Attn:" line.  Anyone may build and use Stiquitos in any quantity for
educational or research purposes, but Indiana University reserves all
rights to commercial applications. Questions about Stiquito should be sent
to Prof. Jonathan W. Mills &#60;stiquito@cs.indiana.edu&#62;. To join the Stiquito
mailing list run by Jon Blow of UC/Berkeley, send mail to
stiquito-request@xcf.berkeley.edu.

The following is from Risks Digest 13.83 -- I have no idea what the software
does, but Colby did head up the PARRY project:

  computer based cognitive therapy for depression with therapeutic
  dialogue in everyday language.  Created by Kenneth Mark Colby, M.D.,
