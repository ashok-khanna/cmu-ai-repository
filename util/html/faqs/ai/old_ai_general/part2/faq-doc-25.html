Both the NAFIPS-L and Fuzzy-Mail mailing lists are now gatewayed to
comp.ai.fuzzy. 

NAFIPS Fuzzy Logic Mailing List at Georgia State University:
   NAFIPS-L@gsuvm1.gsu.edu

   To subscribe send the following command to LISTSERV@GSUVM1.BITNET:
      SUB NAFIPS-L your_full_name
   where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id.
   Non-BitNet users can join by sending the above command as the only
   line in the text/body of a message to LISTSERV@GSUVM1.GSU.EDU. 
   (NAFIPS = "North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society")

   Postings to this mailing list are automatically archived.

Technical University of Vienna Fuzzy Logic Mailing List:
   fuzzy-mail@vexpert.dbai.tuwien.ac.at

   To subscribe send the following command to
   listproc@vexpert.dbai.tuwien.ac.at: 
      SUB FUZZY-MAIL your_full_name
   where "your_full_name" is your real name, not your login Id.

   This mailing list is two-way gatewayed to the NAFIPS-L list and to
   the comp.ai.fuzzy newsgroup.

   The listserver also gives access to some files, including the 
   "Who is Who in Fuzzy Logic" database that is currently under
   construction by Robert Fuller &#60;rfuller@finabo.abo.fi&#62;.
