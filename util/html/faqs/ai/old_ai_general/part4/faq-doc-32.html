<PRE>
Videotapes:

   The 4th episode of the PBS series "The Machine That Changed the World" is
   a good introduction to AI. It is available for $90 from Films for the
   Humanities, 1-800-257-5126.

   Morgan Kaufmann also has a good set of tapes of AI-related lectures, but
   it runs on the expensive side.

   University Video Communications sells a few AI-related videotapes,
   including Allen Newell's "Desires &#38; Diversions". For more
   information, write to UVC, PO Box 5129, Stanford, CA 94309, call
   415-813-0506, fax 415-813-0315, or email uvc.lemon@forsythe.stanford.edu.
