This part of the AI FAQ provides a bibliography of good introductory
texts and overviews of AI and specific subfields of AI. If you feel
that there is a reference or set of references which should be added
to this FAQ, or references which should be removed, please send email
to mkant+ai-faq@cs.cmu.edu.  When suggesting references to be
included in a particular subfield, only suggest the best two or three
references (or a particularly well-written overview). It is NOT the
intention of this listing to be a comprehensive AI bibliography.

Books suggested by their authors must present a strongly argued case.
Also, I generally will include books in this list only after I have
had a chance to look at them.  If you are the author or publisher of a
new AI-related text, and you want me to consider your book for this
list, send a complimentary copy to Mark Kantrowitz, School of Computer
Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh,
PA 15213-3891 USA. Please don't waste my time with books that are
clearly not appropriate for this list. When I am done with the book I
will donate it to the CMU Engineering &#38; Science Library.
