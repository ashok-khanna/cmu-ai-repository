<PRE>
Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .gz, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .gz suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from
   <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/</A>
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

If you do not have ftp access, you can FTP files by E-mail. Send a
message with the word "help" in the body to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. As
the DECWRL ftpmail server is overloaded, you are encouraged to use an
alternate ftpmail server, such as ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au (Australia),
ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (Germany), ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk (Great
Britain), ftpmail@ieunet.ie (Ireland), ftpmail@lth.se (Sweden),
ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu (USA), ftpmail@ftp.uu.net (USA, message
relayed to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, so don't use it),
ftpmail@gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu (USA), or
ftpmail@seds.lpl.arizona.edu (USA). If you're on BITNET, send a
message with the word "help" in the body to BITFTP@PUCC, BITFTP@PLEARN
or BITFTP@DEARN (Internet equivalents bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu,
bitftp@plearn.edu.pl and bitftp@vm.gmd.de, respectively).

In general, see the Lisp FAQ for Lisp-related software and the Prolog
Resource Guide and the Prolog FAQ for Prolog-related software. If a
Lisp-based or Prolog-based system is listed here, only the ftp site
and directory will be listed; for a more detailed description, see the
Lisp FAQ and the Prolog Resource Guide. For information on obtaining
the Lisp FAQ or the Prolog Resource Guide see [1-0].

When referring to software, "alpha" indicates an internal early
release, "beta" indicates an external early release, and "omega"
indicates an external "finished" release. Generally an "alpha" release
means the creator hasn't yet tested for bugs.
