<PRE>

In addition to programs available free by anonymous ftp, we've
included some programs which are available by contacting the authors,
and some programs which charge a nominal fee.

Agent Modelling:

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell,
   &#60;toby@castle.ed.ac.uk&#62;, for his PhD thesis.  The thesis examines the
   problem of action selection when dealing with realistic, animal-like
   situations: how to choose, at each moment in time, the most
   appropriate out of a repertoire of possible actions.  It includes a
   description is given of a simulated environment which is an extensive
   and detailed simulation of the problem of action selection for
   animals.  This simulated environment is used to investigate the
   adequacy of several theories of action selection (from both ethology
   and artificial intelligence) such as the drive model, Lorenz's
   psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading activation network, and
   outlines deficiencies in each mechanism. Finally, it proposes a new
   approach to action selection is developed which determines the most
   appropriate action in a principled way, and which does not suffer from
   the inherent shortcomings found in other methods. The thesis includes
   a review and bibliography of existing work on action selection. The
   thesis is available by anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id47 HREF="ftp://ftp.ed.ac.uk/pub/lrtt/">ftp.ed.ac.uk:/pub/lrtt/</A> [129.215.146.5]
   as the files as.1.ps.Z, as.2.ps.Z, ..., and as.7.ps.Z.
   The simulation software is also available from the same site, as the
   file se.tar.Z. The simulation software was written in Suntools rather
   than Xtools.  It can be run only from SunView or OpenWindows.  The
   action selection problem modelled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing, not
   getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc), many internal and
   external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see the
   bibliography section on User Modelling).  This can be seen as a form of
   agent modelling tool, which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep
   nested belief spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs 
   that are typically held by groups of agents.  ViewGen is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id48 HREF="ftp://crl.nmsu.edu/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder">crl.nmsu.edu:/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder</A> [128.123.1.18] (user anonymous)
      <A NAME=id49 HREF="ftp://ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/ballim">ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/ballim</A>    [141.58.127.8] (user ftp)
   as the file ViewGen.tar.Z. The theory of belief ascription upon which
   it is based is described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation which is
   archived with the Viewgen program (in the files 
      ViewFinder-{A4/A5/US}.tar.Z, 
   the variable part indicating the format of the PostScript file).
   The inheritance reasoner is in the file vf-hetis.tar.Z.
   Implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence easily convertible to
   any Edinburgh-style prolog. Contact Afzal Ballim &#60;afzal@divsun.unige.ch&#62;
   for more information.

               Forbus, and Gentner's 1987 AIJ article.  

Artificial Life:

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.
   Tierra runs in Unix and MS-DOS. Source code and documentation is
   available by anonymous ftp at 
      <A NAME=id51 HREF="ftp://tierra.slhs.udel.edu/almond/">tierra.slhs.udel.edu:/almond/</A> [128.175.41.34]

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 
      <A NAME=id67 HREF="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/screamer.tar.Z">ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z</A>
   Contact Jeffrey Mark Siskind &#60;qobi@ai.mit.edu&#62; for further information.

   The Screamer Tool Repository, a collection of user-contributed
   Screamer code, is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id68 HREF="ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/screamer-tools/">ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/screamer-tools/</A>

Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases:

   Explora is a data mining package written in Lisp for the Macintosh. It
   includes a natural language hypertext-type interface for presentation
   of dicoveries. It is available by anonymous FTP from 
      <A NAME=id70 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/GMD/explora/">ftp.gmd.de:/GMD/explora/</A>
   as the files Explora.sit.hqx and README. For more information, see
      <A NAME=id71 HREF="http://orgwis.gmd.de/explora/">http://orgwis.gmd.de:80/explora/</A>

   INSPECT is a PC-based data mining tool with visualization and neural
   networks. It is available by anonymous FTP from
      <A NAME=id72 HREF="ftp://ftp.tuwien.ac.at/Sources/NeuralNet/Inst-of-Chem/">ftp.tuwien.ac.at:/Sources/NeuralNet/Inst-of-Chem/</A>

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id73 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/</A>
   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt &#60;ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk&#62; and Jens
   Doerpmund &#60;dorpmunj@cs.man.ac.uk&#62; and runs in Common Lisp.

   GPQUICK is a simple GP system implemented in C++.  It features an
   elegant object architecture with function (Function), program
   (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  The Problem class
   is proposed as a portable representation for problems that would be
   source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.  GPQUICK uses a
   steady state GA, tournament selection, one type of mutation, and
   subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear representation for
   S-expressions. It includes documentation from the associated magazine
   article (Byte, "Some Assembly Required", February 1994). GPQUICK is
   available by anonymous ftp from

   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600
   and higher, VAX Common Lisp, and MCL. The XGinseng interface is built
   on top of Garnet.  SNePS 2.1 is free according to the GNU General
   Public License version 2. The SNePS distribution is available by

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
   free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id103 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/gmd/mlt/Mobal/">ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/</A>
   The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a

   OC1 (Oblique Classifier 1) is a multivariate decision tree induction
   system designed for applications where the instances have numeric
   feature values.  OC1 builds decision trees that contain linear
   combinations of one or more attributes at each internal node; these
   trees then partition the space of examples with both oblique and
   axis-parallel hyperplanes.  OC1 has been used for classification of
   data from several real world domains, such as astronomy and cancer
   diagnosis.  A technical decription of the algorithm can be found in
   the AAAI-93 paper by Sreerama K. Murthy, Simon Kasif, Steven Salzberg
   and Richard Beigel.  A postscript version of this paper is included in
   the distribution. OC1 is a written entirely in ANSI C. OC1 is

   Set-Enumeration (SE) Trees for Induction/Classification. Significant
   research in Machine Learning, and in Statistics, has been devoted to
   the induction and use of decision trees as classifiers.  An induction
   framework which generalizes decision trees using a Set-Enumeration
   (SE) tree is outlined in  
      Rymon, R. (1993), An SE-tree-based Characterization of the Induction
      Problem. In Proc. of the Tenth International Conference on Machine
      Learning, Amherst MA, pp. 268-275.
   In this framework, called SE-Learn, rather than splitting according to
   a single attribute, one recursively branches on all (or most) relevant
   attributes. An induced SE-tree can be shown to economically embed many
   decision trees, thereby supporting a more expressive hypothesis
   representation. Also, by branching on many attributes, SE-Learn
   removes much of the algorithm-dependent search bias. Implementations
   of SE-Learn can benefit from many techniques developed for decision
   trees (e.g., attribute-selection and pruning measures). In particular,
   SE-Learn can be tailored to start off with one's favorite decision
   tree, and then improve upon it by further exploring the SE-tree. This
   hill-climbing algorithm allows trading time/space for added accuracy.
   Current studies (yet unpublished) show that SE-trees are particularly
   advantageous in domains where (relatively) few examples are available
   for training, and in noisy domains. Finally, SE-trees can provide a
   unified framework for combining induced knowledge with knowledge
   available from other sources (Rymon, 1994).

   MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
   environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
   oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
   with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
   oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
   and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
   architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
   continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
   supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
   weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
   can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
   support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
   and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
   non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. _
   MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
   University Electrical Engineering. The software is written in 'C' and
   is being used on Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to

   ToolDiag
   ToolDiag is a feature selection program that increases the accuracy of
   classifiers and reduces their complexity by providing them with a
   subset containing only the most relevant features. It has interfaces
   to LVQ_PAK and SNNS, and uses a data file format that is compatible
   with that of LVQ_PAK. The 2-d graphics can be displayed using the
   GNUPLOT plotting package. ToolDiag implements many concepts from
   Devijver and Kittler's book "Pattern Recognition -- A Statistical
   Approach" (Prentice Hall, 1982), including the optimal branch and
   bound search strategy, together with several different selection
   criteria. ToolDiag can also perform an error estimation using the
   leave-one-out method and a K-nearest-neighbor classifier. It also
   includes a learning module (Q*) that has the same functionality as
   LVQ. ToolDiag cannot handle missing values and requires continuous or
   ordered discrete numerical features. ToolDiag is implemented in C and
   documentation and source code are available by anonymous ftp from

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The Animator, developed by Lori Pratt and Steve Nicodemus
   of the Colorado School of Mines, uses the Motif toolkit on an IBM
   RS6000 with X-Windows.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.  The animator is available by

   MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is an efficient implementation of the
   back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.  The
   algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
   descent.  All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
   and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
   peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
   caches.  On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x speed-up
   can be measured respect to conventional implementations.  
   The software is available by anonymous ftp from

   THE BRAIN is a neural network (backpropagation) simulator for MSDOS
   systems. It is simple enough to be used by non-technical people,
   yet sophisticated enough for serious research work. It is available
   by anonymous ftp from

Neural Systems (Biological Simulation):

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  It is in the public domain and runs on Unix workstations
   (a less-powerful PC version is also available). BIOSIM includes a
   graphical user interface and was designed for research and teaching.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id149 HREF="ftp://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/bio/neurobio">ftp.uni-kl.de:/pub/bio/neurobio</A> [131.246.9.95]

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  GENESIS and its graphical front-end
   XODUS are written in C and run on SUN and DEC graphics work stations
   under UNIX (Sun version 4.0 and up, Ultrix 3.1, 4.0 and up), and
   X-windows (versions X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5).  The current version of
   GENESIS has also been used with Silicon Graphics (Irix 4.0.1 and up)
   and the HP 700 series (HPUX).  The distribution includes full source
   code and documentation for both GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen
   demonstration and tutorial simulations.  Documentation for these
   simulations is included, along with three papers that describe the
   general organization of the simulator.  GENESIS is available by
   anonymous ftp from genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.137.64). Before
   using ftp, you must telnet to genesis.cns.caltech.edu and login as the
   user "genesis" (no password required) to register.  If you answer all
   the questions asked of you an 'ftp' account will automatically be
   created for you.  You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download
   the software.  Further inquiries concerning GENESIS may be addressed
   to genesis@cns.caltech.edu.

Probabilistic Reasoning:

   BELIEF is a Common Lisp implementation of the Dempster and Kong fusion
   and propagation algorithm for Graphical Belief Function Models and the
   Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter algorithm for Graphical Probabilistic
   Models. It includes code for manipulating graphical belief models such
   as Bayes Nets and Relevance Diagrams (a subset of Influence Diagrams)
   using both belief functions and probabilities as basic representations
   of uncertainty. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.stat.washington.edu [128.95.17.34]
   and by email from the author, Russell Almond &#60;almond@stat.washington.edu&#62;.
   Contact the author at almond@statsci.com for information about a
   commercial version GRAPHICAL-BELIEF currently in the prototype stages.

   IDEAL is a LISP system developed for building and evaluating influence
   diagrams and Bayesian networks.  It is accompanied with a graphical
   user interface (CLIM-based) for constructing, editing, and solving
   belief networks and influence diagrams. For more information, write
   to srinivas@rpal.rockwell.com.

   AbTweak is a complete hierarchical, non-linear planner that extends
   David Chapman's (MIT 1986) "Tweak" planner as described by
   Yang (Waterloo) and Tenenberg (Rochester) in 1989.  This implementation
   by Steven Woods (1991 Masters Thesis) includes a complete search 
   strategy suited to abstraction hierarchies known as LEFT-WEDGE (Woods 1991).
   This planner and related work predates that of SNLP. AbTweak has a 
   WWW homepage containing source &#38; related papers accessible on
