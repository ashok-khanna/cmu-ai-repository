CMU AI Repository:

   The CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by
   Carnegie Mellon University to contain public domain and freely
   distributable software, publications, and other materials of
   interest to AI researchers, educators, students, and practitioners. 
   The AI Repository currently contains more than a gigabyte of
   material and is growing steadily. 

   The AI Repository is accessible for free by anonymous FTP, AFS, and
   WWW. A selection of materials from the AI Repository is also being
   published on CD-ROM by Prime Time Freeware and is available for
   purchase by mail or fax (see [6-5] for more information).

   The AI Repository is accessible by anonymous FTP from
      <A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/</A>            [128.2.206.173]
   by AFS (Andrew File System) from
      <A NAME=id3 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/">/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/</A>
   and by WWW from the URL   
      <A NAME=id4 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html</A>
   Be sure to read the files 0.doc and readme.txt in this directory.

   The AI Repository is still under construction, but to date, the
   AI Programming Languages and the AI Software Packages sections
   are "complete". These can be accessed in the lang/ and areas/
   subdirectories of the AI Repository. Compression and archiving
   utilities may be found in the util/ subdirectory.  Other directories,
   which are in varying states of completion, are events/ (Calendar of
   Events, Conference Calls) and pubs/ (Publications, including technical
   reports, books, mail/news archives).

   The AI Programming Languages section of the repository includes
   directories for Common Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, Smalltalk, and
   other AI-related programming languages. 

   The AI Software Packages section of the repository includes
   subdirectories for:

      agents/      Intelligent Agent Architectures

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.  
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else in 
   the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is accessible
   through the URL
      <A NAME=id5 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/keys/keysform.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/keys/keysform.html</A>

   We plan on making the source code (including indexes) to
   this keyword searching program available, as soon as it is stable.

   We hope to eventually have a fully automated calendar of events,
   an expanded AI Publications directory, mailing list and newsgroup
   archives, and much much more. 

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:
      <A NAME=id6 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/new/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/</A>
   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to
      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu
   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   For more information on the CMU AI Repository, please send mail to
   Mark Kantrowitz &#60;AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu&#62;.

Ada Repository:

   The Ada Repository on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (mailing list
   ada-sw@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil) contains a directory of AI programs in
   PD2:&#60;ADA.AI&#62;*.*. A somewhat easier to access copy of the archives is
   available as <A NAME=id8 HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors/ada/ai/">wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/ada/ai/</A>.

UCLA Artificial Life Depository:

   <A NAME=id9 HREF="ftp://ftp.cognet.ucla.edu/pub/alife/">ftp.cognet.ucla.edu:/pub/alife/</A> [128.97.8.19]

   Repository of papers, articles, tech reports, software and other items of
   interest to Artificial Life researchers. It includes an archive of
   past postings to the alife mailing list, alife@cognet.ucla.edu (send
   mail to alife-request@cognet.ucla.edu to be added to the list).

Artificial Life Online and the Artificial Life BBS:

   Sponsored by MIT Press and the Santa Fe Institute, Artificial Life
   Online and the Artificial Life BBS is intended to be a central
   information collection and distribution site on the Internet for any
   and all aspects of the Artificial Life endeavor.

   A special feature of the BBS is a collection of 40 or so local
   newsgroups dedicated to a wide variety of topics in Artificial Life.

   Artificial Life Online is accessible by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id10 HREF="ftp://alife.santafe.edu/pub/">alife.santafe.edu:/pub/</A> [192.12.12.99]
   by World-Wide Web from
      <A NAME=id11 HREF="http://alife.santafe.edu/">http://alife.santafe.edu/</A>
   and by Gopher from
      <A NAME=id12 HREF="gopher://alife.santafe.edu:70/">gopher://alife.santafe.edu:70/</A>

   To access the Alife Online BBS (ALBBS) by telnet, telnet to
   alife.santafe.edu and login as "bbs". You will find yourself in a
   specially constructed UNIX shell within which either BBS menu commands
   or UNIX commands can be used to browse around in the system. Run the
   "account" program to set up a local account. These accounts will
   initially be provided free of charge, but they will eventually have to
   charge a nominal fee in order to cover operating expenses (on the
   order of $15-$25 per year). Subscribers to the Artificial Life Journal
   from MIT Press will have this fee waived. Once you have an account on
   alife.santafe.edu, you can telnet to alife.santafe.edu and login as
   yourself. You do not have to create an account to use the ALBBS via
   telnet -- you can simply login as "bbs" and browse through the system
   using the BBS commands.

   Please send suggestions and questions about the Alife Online/BBS
   system to feedback@alife.santafe.edu.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. 
   All algorithms are written in Edinburgh Prolog syntax. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 
   The programs are currently available via anonymous ftp-server from
   the GMD: 

        <A NAME=id29 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/gmd/mlt/ML-Program-Library/">ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/ML-Program-Library/</A> [129.26.8.84]

   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe, 
   Projektgruppe KIT, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Franklinstr. 28/29,
   10629 Berlin, Germany. Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated
   3.5 inch floppy (double, high and extra-high density),  which should
   be included with your request. You can also get them by sending an email
   message to Thomas Hoppe (see below).

   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems
   to Thomas Hoppe, &#60;hoppet@cs.tu-berlin.de&#62;. Send suggestions and
   complaints about the ftp library to Werner Emde, Gesellschaft
   fuer Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung, Bonn, &#60;emde@gmd.de&#62;. 

   The directory <A NAME=id30 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/MachineLearning/">ftp.gmd.de:/MachineLearning/</A> contains additional
   machine learning publications, data, and software, primarily related
   to the European ESPRIT projects Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT) and
   Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the European Network of Excellence
   in Machine Learning (MLnet) and the Inductive Logic Programming
   Pan-European Scientific Network (ILPnet). It includes the source code
   of Stephen Muggleton's and Cao Feng's GOLEM learning system (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/software/golem) and a BibTex file with
   around 325 entries of articles related to ILP (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/bib). For more information, send mail to
   Marcus Luebbe &#60;ml-archive@gmd.de&#62;.
