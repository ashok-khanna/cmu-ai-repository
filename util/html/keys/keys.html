<H2>The Keys Program</H2>

<tt>keys</tt> version 1.0 (19-JUL-94)<BR>
Copyright (c) 1994 by Mark Kantrowitz. All rights reserved.<BR>
Please see <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/keys/copying.txt"><tt>copying.txt</tt></A> for details.
<p>
This program searches the keyword index and package list files for
the CMU AI Repository and/or the PTF for AI CD-ROM for all packages
that match the keywords given on the command line. If any packages
match, they are printed.
<p>
A package must match all the keywords to be printed. To perform several
searches at once, separate the keywords with 'or' or '-o'.
<p>
Keywords are compared with the keyword index in a case-insensitive
fashion. Keywords may be regular expressions in the format used by ed
or grep. You do not need to quote the regular expressions, as 
characters that are special to the shell have been protected.

<H2>Regular Expression Syntax Synopsis</H2>

A synopsis of regular expression syntax is as follows:
<pre>
   char     Matches itself
   .        Matches any single character except newline
   ?        Preceding item is optional
   *        Preceding item may be included 0 or more times
   +        Preceding item may be included 1 or more times
   |        OR
   ^        Beginning of line
   $        End of line
   <        Beginning of word
   >        End of word
   [chars]  Range of characters, e.g., [a-z], [abde], [0-9]
   \        Use before one of above characters to escape it
   ()       Overrides operator precedence, and provides 'memory'
   \n       Matches repeat of text matched earlier in nth ()
</pre>

<H2>Keyword Searching By Mail</H2>

To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to
<tt>ai+query@cs.cmu.edu</tt> with lines like
<pre>
   keys lisp faq
</pre>
in the message body. You'll get a response by return mail. For help on
the query mail server, include a line like
<pre>
   help
</pre>
instead. File retrieval is <b>not</b> yet implemented.
<p>
Please be courteous, and phrase your keyword searches so as to not
overwhelm our mailer and yours.
