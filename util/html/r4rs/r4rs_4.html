<TITLE>Scheme - Lexical conventions</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
Go to the <A HREF="r4rs_1.html">first</A>, <A HREF="r4rs_3.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="r4rs_5.html">next</A>, <A HREF="r4rs_14.html">last</A> section, <A HREF="r4rs_toc.html">table of contents</A>.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC15">Lexical conventions</A></H1>
<P>
This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
Scheme, see section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC67">Formal syntax</A>.
<P>
Upper and lower case forms of a letter are never distinguished
except within character and string constants.  For example, <CODE>Foo</CODE>
is
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
the same identifier as <CODE>FOO</CODE>, and <CODE>#x1AB</CODE> is the same number
as
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<CODE>#X1ab</CODE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC16">Identifiers</A></H2>
<P>
Most identifiers
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
allowed by other programming
languages are also acceptable to Scheme.  The precise rules for forming
identifiers vary among implementations of Scheme, but in all
implementations a sequence of letters, digits, and "extended alphabetic
characters" that begins with a character that cannot begin a number is
an identifier.  In addition, <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, and <CODE>...</CODE> are identifiers.
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
Here are some examples of identifiers:
<P>
<PRE>
lambda                   q
list-&#62;vector             soup
+                        V17a
&#60;=?                      a34kTMNs
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings
</PRE>
<P>
Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The following are extended alphabetic characters:
<P>
<PRE>
+ - . * / &#60; = &#62; ! ? : $ % _ &#38; ~ ^
</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC68">Lexical structure</A> for a formal syntax of identifiers.
<P>
Identifiers have several uses within Scheme programs:
<UL>
<LI>Certain identifiers are reserved for use as syntactic keywords
(see below).
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>

<LI>Any identifier that is not a syntactic keyword may be used as a
variable (see section <A HREF="r4rs_5.html#SEC20">Variables and regions</A>).
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>

<LI>When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
(see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC28">Literal expressions</A>), it is being used to denote a
<EM>symbol</EM> (see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC49">Symbols</A>).

</UL>
<P>
The following identifiers are syntactic keywords, and should not be used
as variables:
<P>
<PRE>
=&#62;           do            or
and          else          quasiquote
begin        if            quote
case         lambda        set!
cond         let           unquote
define       let*          unquote-splicing
delay        letrec
</PRE>
<P>
Some implementations allow all identifiers, including syntactic
keywords, to be used as variables.  This is a compatible extension to
the language, but ambiguities in the language result when the
restriction is relaxed, and the ways in which these ambiguities are
resolved vary between implementations.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC17">Whitespace and comments</A></H2>
<P>
<DFN>Whitespace</DFN> characters are spaces and newlines.
(Implementations typically provide additional whitespace characters such
as tab or page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace may occur between any two tokens,
but not within a token.  Whitespace may also occur inside a string,
where it is significant.
<P>
A semicolon (<CODE>;</CODE>) indicates the start of a comment.
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
The comment continues to the end of the line on which the semicolon
appears.  Comments are invisible to Scheme, but the end of the line is
visible as whitespace.  This prevents a comment from appearing in the
middle of an identifier or number.
<P>
<PRE>
;;; The FACT procedure computes the factorial
;;; of a non-negative integer.
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1        ;Base case: return 1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC18">Other notations</A></H2>
<P>
For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC50">Numbers</A>.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>. + -</TT>
<DD>These are used in numbers, and may also occur anywhere in an identifier
except as the first character.  A delimited plus or minus sign by itself
is also an identifier.
A delimited period (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used
in the notation for pairs (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC48">Pairs and lists</A>), and to indicate a
rest-parameter in a  formal parameter list (section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC30">Lambda expressions</A>).
A delimited sequence of three successive periods is also an identifier.

<DT><TT>( )</TT>
<DD>Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
(section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC48">Pairs and lists</A>).

<DT><TT>'</TT>
<DD>The single quote character is used to indicate literal data (section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC28">Literal expressions</A>).

<DT><TT>`</TT>
<DD>The backquote character is used to indicate almost-constant
data (section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC39">Quasiquotation</A>).

<DT><TT>, ,@</TT>
<DD>The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in conjunction
with backquote (section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC39">Quasiquotation</A>).

<DT><TT>"</TT>
<DD>The double quote character is used to delimit strings (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC58">Strings</A>).

<DT><TT>\</TT>
<DD>Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
(section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC57">Characters</A>) and as an escape character within string
constants (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC58">Strings</A>).

<DT><TT>[ ] { }</TT>
<DD>Left and right square brackets and curly braces
are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.

<DT><TT>#</TT>
<DD>Sharp sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on
the character that immediately follows it:

<DT><TT>#t #f</TT>
<DD>These are the boolean constants (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC46">Booleans</A>).

<DT><TT>#\</TT>
<DD>This introduces a character constant (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC57">Characters</A>).

<DT><TT>#(</TT>
<DD>This introduces a vector constant (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC59">Vectors</A>).  Vector
constants are terminated by <SAMP>`)'</SAMP> .

<DT><TT>#e #i #b #o #d #x</TT>
<DD>These are used in the notation for numbers (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC54">Syntax of numerical constants</A>).
