You may be interested in KQML -- Knowledge Query and Manipulation
Language -- a new language and protocol for exchanging information and
knowledge.  This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge
Sharing Initiative which is aimed at developing techniques and
methodology for building large-scale knowledge bases which are
sharable and reusable.  KQML is both a message format and a
message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among
agents.  KQML can be used as a language for an application program to
interact with an intelligent system or for two or more intelligent
systems to share knowledge in support of cooperative problem solving.

KQML focuses on an extensible set of performatives, which defines the
permissible operations that agents may attempt on each other's
knowledge and goal stores.  The performatives comprise a substrate on
which to develop higher-level models of interagent interaction such as
contract nets and negotiation.  In addition, KQML provides a basic
architecture for knowledge sharing through a special class of agent
called communication facilitators which coordinate the interactions of
other agents.  The ideas which underlie the evolving design of KQML are
currently being explored through experimental prototype systems which
are being used to support several testbeds in such areas as concurrent
engineering, intelligent design and intelligent planning and
scheduling.


Here is some information on a mailing list for KQML...

In order to better manage the KQML mailing list, we've moved to a new
mailing list management package -- majordomo.  Hopefully, this
software will allow us to better manage the list, which, due to
various technical difficulties, has been dormant for too long.  I've
reconstructed this list membership as best as I could and you are
thought to be (still) interested in being on the KQML mailing list.
If you aren't, you can get off the list by sending an email message to
MAJORDOMO@CS.UMBC.EDU with this string in the *body*:

  unsubscribe KQML

You can always send mail to me, of course, if you don't like dealing
with these sorts of automatic systems.  (Note that if you "reply" to
this message, you mailer will by default send the message back to the
list.)  


I've appended the current membership list to the end of this message.
If you know someone who might be interested in KQML who isn't on the
list, please forward this message to them.


The KQML mailing list is intended for general discussions about the
conceptual design and use of KQML. All message traffic will be
automatically archived and these archives, as well as other files, can
be retrieved by ftp and by email. here is a quick list of useful
commands you can send to MAJORDOMO@CS.UMBC.EDU.  Note, these should
appear in the message body, not the Subject line:

  help			; I'm clueless.
  info kqml		; What's the point of this list?
  who kqml		; Who's subscribed to it?
  index kqml		; What files are available for retrieval? 
  get kqml <file>	; Email me the file <file> associated with KQML.
  unsubscribe kqml	; Get me off the mailing list.
  subscribe kqml	; put me on the mailing list.

If you send the HELP request, you will get a more complete list of
commands.


There is a related mailing list, KQML_DEVELOPERS, intended for
discussions about the more detailed, low-level "nuts and bolts" design
of KQML and about implementations of KQML interfaces and APIs.  To
keep this list focused on appropriate issues, membership will be
restricted to people who are actively involved in the design and
development of KQML component implmentations.  You can subscribe to it
by sending MAJORDOMO@CS.UMBC.EDU a message containing "subscribe
KMQL_DEVELOPERS" but this require the approval of the mailing list
manager.

You might want to ftp the following papers from host hpp.stanford.edu using anonymous
ftp from directory pub/knowledge-sharing:

kr92-status-report.ps
kqml-spec.ps
kif.ps

Hope this helps.

There is a World-Wide-Web page on KQML

	http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/

which contains pointers to all of the basic information on KQML plus
links other informations sources at Unisys, EIT, Lockheed and
Stanford.  It provides access to information on mailing lists,
available software, papers, etc.  We hope that this will provide a
one-stop-shopping source for information on KQML and closely related
topics. 

You can also access this information via gopher as
gopher://gopher.cs.umbc.edu/11/kqml and via ftp from ftp.cs.umbc.edu
in pub/kqml.  You can retrieve many of the files via email -- send
majordomo@cs.umbc.edu a message containing the string "index kqml" in
the body to see what is available.

KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) is language and
protocol for exchanging information and knowledge.  It is being

Look at http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/ for material on KQML which is a
language and protocol that has been used to support inter-agent
communication for heterogeneous agent communities.  Look at
http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kse/ for an overview of the "Knowledge Sharing
Effort" which has addressed some of the issues of building and
communicating common ontologies and knowledge bases.

Some of this material can also be accessed via FTP from
ftp.cs.umbc.edu in pub/ARPA/
