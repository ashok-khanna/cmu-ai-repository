Summary:      Telos temporal/sorted logic system

Version:      KNOWBEL (26-JUN-91); MANUAL (6-FEB-92)

Description: 

   KNOWBEL is a Common Lisp implementation of the Telos Knowledge
   Representation Language. This includes a frame-based object language
   with inheritance, a resolution theorem prover, and a temporal
   reasoner.

   KNOWBEL is no longer actively being worked on so support will be
   minimal.

Requires:     Common Lisp
