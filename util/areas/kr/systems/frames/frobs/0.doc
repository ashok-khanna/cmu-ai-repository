Name:         FROBS

Summary:      Object-oriented frame language for Common Lisp

Version:      1.2 (2-AUG-88)

Description: 

   FROBS is a merger between frames and objects.  It is implemented in
   Common Lisp and provides an object-oriented language as well as frame
   type operations and a forward chaining rule system.  The rule system
   translates rule definitions into functions which can then be compiled
   by the native Common Lisp compiler.

   The frobs-doc.l file is something that someone else did to add
   documentation strings to FROBS.  It is not something that we load
   automatically, so is separate.  Having it be a separate file is fine.
   It is not a document describing FROBS or FROLIC, which are in the tar
   files as frobs.ps and prolog.ps.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Lucid CL, KCL, Allegro CL
