Summary:      Sequent Based High Level Proof System

Version:      11.5

Description: 

   This directory contains ONTIC, a sequent based high level proof system.
   Ontic is an integrated system for the development and manipulation of
   technical information, such as abstract mathematical concepts and
   theorems, formal system specifications, system implementations, and
   system verifications. The Ontic language is a simple generalization of
   strongly typed functional programming languages like ML and the typed
   lambda-calculus.
