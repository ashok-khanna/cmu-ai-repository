Name:         SNePS

Summary:      Semantic Network Processing System

Version:      2.1 rel 1-400

Description: 

   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  

   Note: The bib.tgz and manual.pgz files are already included in the
   release; they're there in case you don't want to unpack the entire
   release just to get the bibliography and manual.

Requires:     Common Lisp, Garnet (for XGinseng)

Ports:        SNePS has been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0,
              TI Common Lisp, CLISP May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should
              also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600 and higher, VAX
              Common Lisp, and MCL.
