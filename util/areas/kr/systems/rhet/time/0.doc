Package:      areas/kr/systems/rhet/time/

Name:         TimeLogic and Tempos

Summary:      Time reasoning system.

Version:      Tempos 3.12, TimeLogic 5.1 

Description: 

   TIMELOGIC and TEMPOS add James Allen's interval logic to Rhet.

   The TimeLogic system is an interval-based forward chaining inference
   engine and database manager of temporal constraints.  Relational
   constraints, indicating relative order between intervals, are based on
   Allen's interval logic.  The TimeLogic system also supports durational
   constraints, indicating relative magnitude between intervals, and
   reference links, used for the explicit or automatic construction of
   interval hierarchies.  Constraints are posed and propagated in
   user-defined contexts with inheritance. Supports relative metric
   constraints but no absolute dates or times.

Requires:     Common Lisp, CL-LIB

Ports:        Runs on Symbolics Genera 8.1.1, Allegro CL 4.1
