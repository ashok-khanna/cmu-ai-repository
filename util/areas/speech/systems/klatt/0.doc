Name:         Klatt

Summary:      A Klatt-style speech synthesizer implemented in C.

Version:      3.0.4 (9-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains a C implementation of a Klatt-style cascade
   parallel formant speech synthesizer.  The software is an attempt to
   implement, and remain faithful to, Dennis Klatt's original design of
   software synthesizer, as described in the original JASA article.

   The aim of the software is to convert frames of audio parameters into
   chunks of speech waveform. Forty parameters are specified per frame,
   including formant frequencies, amplitudes and bandwidths, voicing,
   frication and so on. Each frame of parameters usually represents 10ms
   of output speech. Two (simple!) example parameter files are
   supplied with the package.
