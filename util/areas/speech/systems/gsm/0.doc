Summary:      Implementation of the 13 kbps GSM speech coding standard.

Version:      1.0.4 (10-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains an implementation of the European GSM 06.10
   provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036,
   which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction)
   coding at 13 kbit/sec. 

   GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
   rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
   with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of 160
   16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
   The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
   recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
   form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

   The interfaces offered are a front end modeled after compress(1), and
   a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
   on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against
   the ETSI standard test patterns.
