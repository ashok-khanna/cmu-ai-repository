Description: 

   This directory contains RPLAY, a sound package that supports both
   local and remote sound control.  RPLAY is based on client/server
   communication using two protocols.  The first protocol that can be
   used is RPLAY, which is UDP based and allows sounds to be played,
   paused, continued, and stopped.  The second protocol is RPTP (the
   Remote Play Transfer Protocol) which is TCP based and allows sounds to
   be played, paused, continued, stopped, and transferred.
