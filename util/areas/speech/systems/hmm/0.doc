Package:      areas/speech/systems/hmm/

Name:         HMM

Summary:      Hidden Markov Model software for automatic speech recognition.

Version:      1.0 (31-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains HMM, an example of the Hidden Markov Model
   algorithms used by L. Rabiner, K-F Lee, and others for speech
   recognition. The code implements in C++ a basic left-right Hidden
   Markov Model and corresponding Baum-Welch (ML) training algorithm.

Requires:     C++

Ports:        Tested under Linux and SunOS.
