Summary:      Speech data manipulation tools

Version:      1.0 (20-OCT-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains the OGI Speech Tools, a set of speech data
   manipulation tools developed at the Center for Spoken Language
   Understanding (CSLU) at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and
   Technology (Portland Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and
   display signal representations, label speech at different levels
   (e.g., phonetic, phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers,
   and display the output of classification or recognition algorithms
   time-aligned with the speech.

   The distribution includes, among other things,

      +  LYRI, an X Windows tool for displaying data in a time
         synchronous fashion (speech signal, spectrograms, phoneme
         labels).  

      +  NOPT, a neural network training package, which uses Conjugate
         Gradient descent optimization.

      +  LIBNSPEECH, an extensive set of C library signal processing
         routines for the manipulation of speech data, including PLP
         Analysis, Rasta PLP Analysis, Linear Predictive Coding, Mel
         Cepstrum Coding, and Fast Fourier Transform.

      +  Utilities for converting file formats, such as ADC to NIST,
         to/from mu-law, filtering the speech waveform, and
         ascii/binary data streams. 

      +  A Vector-Quantizer based on the Linde Buzo and Gray (LBG) algorithm.
