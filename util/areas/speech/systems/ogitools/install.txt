OVERVIEW OF INSTALLATION STEPS 

	1) Unload the tar file
	2) edit configuration file(s)
	3) compile tools


UNLOADING TAR FILE

	You will needed 7Meg of disk space for the source
	code and about 6Meg for the every architecture you
	wish to compile.  This mean you will need about 14Meg
	to compile one architecture.

	Create a directory in which you will unload the tar file.
	This directory will be referred to as <tools/src> in the
	follow instructions.

	To unload the tar file do:

		% cd <tools>
                % cd src
		% tar xvf ogitools.v1.0.tar


CONFIGURATION

	Before you can compile the tools software you must
	edit the configuration file for each machine architecture
	you plane on compiling.  The configuration files
	are found in <tools>/src/conf .  The configuration file
	names are of the form <arch>.conf, where <arch>
	is the architecture of the host.  For a SPARC
	station <arch> would be 'sun4'.  The supported architecture
	are:
		
		sun4 	- Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.1
		decmips	- DECStation Ultrix 4.2
		aix 	- RS6000 AIX v3.2 with X11R4
		hpux	- PA-RISC HP-UX 8.0


	You must set the following parameters in the 
	configuration files:

		TOP
		INSTALL_LIB_DIR
		INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR
		INSTALL_BIN_DIR
		INSTALL_SHARE_DIR


	TOP should be set to <tools>/src

	INSTALL_LIB_DIR should be set to the absolute path to
	where the speech library will be installed. 

	INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR should be set to the absolute path
	to where the speech include files will be installed.

	INSTALL_BIN_DIR should be set to the absolute path to
	where the speech utilities will be installed.

	INSTALL_SHARE_DIR should be set to the absolute path to
	where the speech scripts will be installed.

	NOTE: These directories must be created before installing
              the speech tools.


COMPILING THE TOOLS

	Once you have edit the configuration file you are ready to
	compile the tools.  The first step is to do a
	a 'make depend' in <tools>/src .

	Do:

		% cd <tools>/src
		% make ARCH=<arch> depend


	After that has finished the tools can be compiled 
	with the following command:

		% make ARCH=<arch>


	To install the libraries and utilities do:

		% make ARCH=<arch> install

	The speech tools and libraries should now be installed.
