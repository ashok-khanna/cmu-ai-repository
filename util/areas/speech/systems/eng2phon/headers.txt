Since I posted to comp.sys.sun that I have this program, I have been
inundated with requests for it.  So I'm making it available for anonymous
ftp from wilma.cs.brown.edu (128.148.31.66).  The author placed it in
the public domain, so feel free to do with it as you like!

One request: if you do anything interesting with it, please let me know.

As Paul and Jef said yes, and at least two of the other messages bounced, I'm
sending this out to all (with alternate addresses :-).  I've changed the
Makefile for UNIX, otherwise it is as distributed in April 1985 (I believe).
I tried to send mail to John A. Wasser, but it bounced from his machine so I
assume he has moved on.

I really do intend to write the second half of this, the phoneme-to-waveform
stage.  However, I'm travelling round the world for the last two months of
this year, so progress will be slow.

Please keep in touch.

Tony.
