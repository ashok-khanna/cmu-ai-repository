Dear Audio Developers and Users:

A number of people have expressed interest in NetAudio, the
network-transparent audio system that NCD originally designed for its
MCX line of X terminals.  As requested, we now have a sample server
that runs on Sun's using the /dev/audio interface (and should be easy
to port).

The sources for NetAudio are now available for anonymous ftp:

	Machine:	ftp.x.org
	IP Address:	198.112.44.100
	Username:	anonymous
	Password:	yourlogin@your.machine.domain
	Directory:	contrib/netaudio/
	Mode:		binary
	Files:		README				the stuff below
			netaudio-930907.tar.Z		NetAudio sources
			sounds.tar.Z			sample sound files
			overview.ps.Z			short overview paper
			slides.ps.Z			slides for overview

Here is an ftp "dir" listing of the contrib/netaudio/ directory:

-rw-r--r--  1 ftp      ftp          9275 Sep  8 02:10 README
-rw-r--r--  1 ftp      ftp        776841 Sep  8 02:04 netaudio-930907.tar.Z
-rw-r--r--  1 ftp      ftp         32797 Sep  8 02:07 overview.ps.Z
-rw-r--r--  1 ftp      ftp         33487 Sep  8 02:08 slides.ps.Z
-rw-r--r--  1 ftp      ftp       1864379 Sep  3 00:41 sounds.tar.Z

This code has been compiled and run under SunOS 4.1.3.  The client side should
recompile on other platforms fairly easily (it uses the R5 imake configuration
files installed on your machine).  The server side should be straightforward to
port to other audio interfaces.

You are welcome and encouraged to look at and use this code.  We use the
standard X Consortium-style (i.e. non-restrictive) copyright.  We have also
set up a mailing list called netaudio@ncd.com for discussion of netaudio issues
(protocol, porting, futures, etc.).  To get on this list, send email to:

			netaudio-request@ncd.com

We hope that you enjoy working with NetAudio and find it to be as useful as 
we and a growing number of ISVs have.

				       or

    			open ("/dev/audio")?  Just Say No!



This directory tree contains sources for the NetAudio network-transparent,
client/server audio system, including:

    o	a sample server implementation for /dev/audio on Suns,
    o	an application programming interface library, and
    o	a variety of sample applications.

The client software can also be used with NCD MCX X terminals running 
NCDware 3.1 or later.  It corresponds to the sources supplied with the
NCDware 3.2 beta release.

Key features of NetAudio include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

Look at the file doc/slides.ps for a brief presentation on NetAudio.  For
more details, read doc/overview.ps.

I.  Roadmap

Here is a quick guide to where things are in this distribution (relative to
the directory netaudio/):

	doc/			not enough documentation; overview, slides, lib
	config/			a little bit of imake stuff
	lib/audio/		API used by sample programs
	clients/audio/		sample programs
	server/			server code
	    dia/		device-independent bits
	    dda/sun/		device-dependent audio driver for sun /dev/audio
	util/			various build utilities

When built, the Sun server will be in server/ausun, the library in 
lib/audio/libaudio.a, and the sample applications in clients/audio/aufoo/aufoo.

In addition, the separate distribution sounds.tar.Z contains a directory of
example sounds:

	examples/sounds/	various sounds that can be played

If you don't have your own sound bites to nibble, grab these.

II.  Building the Release

This software uses "imake" and should be usable with the X11R5 configuration
files.  It has been compiled on a Solbourne running SunOS 4.1.3.  Although the
client side should build on other platforms (perhaps with a minimal amount of
hackery), server device drivers are only provided for the Sun.

We hope to put together some notes about how to go write new device-drivers
soon.  Until then, Use The Source, Luke.  It's actually very straightforward;
the /dev/audio port took several days (including debugging the rearchitected
device-independent parts).

To build the software:

    1.	Make sure you have imake from the X11R5 sources.

    2.	Look at config/NetAudio.tmpl and the BINDIR definition if you want;
	by default, the programs are put into /usr/local/bin/.  Some people
	may find it more convenient just to dump them into /usr/bin/X11/.

    3.	Do "xmkmf" create the initial Makefile.

    4.	Do "make World" (note the uppercase World) to build the distribution.

    5.	If everything built successfully, you can install it using
	"make install"; to temporarily stage it under some directory, use
	"make install DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/netaudio" or some such.

    6.	To install the manual pages, use "make install.man" or 
	"make install.man DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/netaudio" as above.


A complete installation should include the following files:

	/usr/include/audio/Afuncproto.h		Header files
	/usr/include/audio/Afuncs.h
	/usr/include/audio/Amd.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aos.h

	/usr/lib/libaudio.a			API library

	/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Audemo	App-defaults files

	/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Aupanel

	/usr/local/bin/auconvert		Sample programs

	/usr/local/bin/aupanel
	/usr/local/bin/auplay
	/usr/local/bin/aurecord
	/usr/local/bin/auscope
	/usr/local/bin/autool
	/usr/local/bin/ausun			Sample server for /dev/audio
	/usr/local/bin/au			symlink to ausun

	/usr/man/mann/auconvert.n		Manual pages
	/usr/man/mann/auctl.n
	/usr/man/mann/audemo.n
	/usr/man/mann/audial.n
	/usr/man/mann/auedit.n

	/usr/man/mann/auscope.n
	/usr/man/mann/autool.n
	/usr/man/mann/auserver.n
	/usr/man/mann/ncdaudio.n		Should be called netaudio.n...

The file BUGS in the top directory contains a description of known landmines.

III.  Using NetAudio

Now that you have things built, you can use NetAudio as follows:

	%  # Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your path
	%  ausun -aa &		# -aa allows any host access
	%  setenv AUDIOSERVER `hostname`:0
	%  auinfo
	%  audemo examples/sounds
	%  ...

If you are using it over the network, the shorthand syntax for specifying an
audio server is hostname:0.  Access control is still a bit primitive....



				 *  *  *  *  *

IV.  Using NetAudio with Sun Deskset

The "autool" program can be used as a replacement for audiotool.  This allows
Sun Deskset applications (e.g. mailtool, etc.) to be used with NetAudio.  See
the autool man page (clients/audio/autool/autool.man) for details on how to
configure Deskset.



				 *  *  *  *  *

V.  Games

Well, now that you have networked audio, it's time to actually use it for
something.  XBoing and xpilots are both distributed with NetAudio support.
Internally, we have versions of missileX and a derivative of the old
Apple II game spy-vs-spy.  There aren't included in this distribution due
to copyright concerns.



				 *  *  *  *  *

VI.  Finding Sounds to Play With

Users with some versions of SunOS can find a number of audio files to
listen to in /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds/.  Once NetAudio is running, they can
be examined using:

	%  audemo /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds

A separate tar archive called sounds.tar.Z is available from ftp.x.org
containing a variety of 22 kHz.  When played on a Sun, the audio data will
automatically be downsampled, which will result in some loss of quality.  For
the best results on a Sun, find some 8 kHz samples.

For the true audio packrat, there are a number of anonymous ftp sites that
contain archives of thousands of sound bites.  The "Sound Site Newsletter"
published periodically on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard, comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc, and
rec.games.misc contains a detailed list of machines, bulletin boards, etc.

VII.  For More Information

We've set up several mailing lists for folks who are working with NetAudio:

    netaudio@ncd.com		General discussion of NetAudio; anyone who
				who will actively participate is welcome to
				join

    netaudio-request@ncd.com	Where to send requests to get on or off the
				mailing list.


We hope you enjoy NetAudio.  There's still a few pieces to be added, but already
a significant number of hardware and software vendors are finding that it
solves their problems.  Besides, you can't beat the price!  :-)
