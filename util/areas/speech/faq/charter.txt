This article is a CALL FOR VOTES on the creation of comp.speech.

comp.speech (unmoderated)
   This group will be for the discussion of issues related to speech 
   technology - relevant research, application issues and other related 
   matters.  Please read the full charter below before voting.

   The request for discussion (RFD) was posted 3 weeks ago and the discussion
   on forming of the group was generally positive.  The charter remains
   largely unchanged.


HOW TO VOTE
===========

All votes should be mailed to the address "speech_v@ee.su.oz.au".  Each
vote will be sent an ACK (acknowledge) which will include the text that
contains the actual vote and how it was received.  Sample votes are:

	I vote YES on the creation of comp.speech as proposed
	I vote NO on the creation of comp.speech as proposed

Only one vote from each user account will be accepted.  Duplications will
be removed.

Voting will take place from Tuesday 1st September to Tuesday 22nd September.

A second Call for Votes will be posted during the voting period possibly
including a mass acknowledgement.

The guidelines require that there be 100 more YES votes than NO votes, and 
that there also be at least 2/3 YES votes for the proposal to pass.  Full 
RESULTS will be posted at the end of the voting period with 5 days for people 
to verify the results.  At the end of this waiting period the group can be 
created (this would be around the end of September).


CHARTER
=======

comp.speech will be a newsgroup for discussion of application and
research issues associated with speech technology and speech science.
By nature speech technology is an inter-disciplinary field and the 
newsgroup should reflect this.  Computer application should be the basic
theme of the group.

The following is a list of possible topics but does not cover 
all matters related to the field - no order of importance is implied.

[1] Speech Recognition - discussion of methodologies, training, 
techniques, results and applications.  This should cover the application
of techniques including HMMs, neural-nets and so on to the field.

[2] Speech Synthesis - discussion concerning theoretical and practical
issues associated with the design on speech synthesis systems.

[3] Speech Coding and Compression - both research and application matters.

[4] Phonetic/Linguistic Issues - coverage of linguistic and phonetic issues 
which are relevant to speech technology applications.  Could cover parsing, 
natural language processing, and prosodic work.

[5] Speech System Design - issues relating to the application of
speech technology to real-world problems.  Includes the design of
user interfaces, the building of real-time systems and so on.

[6] Other matters - relevant conferences, books, public domain software, 
hardware, and related products and so on.

There are already volunteers who will put together a FAQ list, 
maintain group archives and collect relevant papers.

Thanks,
