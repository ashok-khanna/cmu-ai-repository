FAQ SECTION 2 - Signal Processing for Speech

  Q2.1: WHAT SAMPLING DO I NEED FOR SPEECH?
  
   For recorded speech to be understood by humans you need an 8kHz
   sampling rate or more and at least 8 bit sampling. This produces poor
   quality speech - but in can be understood.
   
   Improvements can be achieved by increasing the number of bits in
   sampling to 12bits or 16bits, or by using a non-linear encoding
   technique such as mu-law or A-law (see Q2.7). This improves the
   "signal-to-noise" ratio.
   
   Increasing the sampling rate above 8kHz, say to 10kHz, 16kHz or 20Khz,
   improves the frequency response: the higher the sampling frequency the
   better the high frequency content will be. A 16kHz sampling rate is a
   reasonable target for high quality speech recording and playback.
   
   When doing speech recognition you need to remember that the your
   computer is not as good as your ear so it will have trouble with poor
   quality sounds. The choice of an appropriate sampling setup depends
   very much on the speech recognition task and the amount of computer
   power available.

  Q2.2: HOW DO I FIND THE PITCH OF A SPEECH SIGNAL?
  
   This topic comes up regularly in the comp.dsp newsgroup. Question 2.5
   of the FAQ posting for comp.dsp gives a comprehensive list of
   references on the definition, perception and processing of pitch.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q2.3: HOW DO I FIND THE START AND END POINTS OF A SPEECH SIGNAL?
  
   A large number of papers have been presented on this task. Try the
   following papers:
     * Rabiner LR, Sambur MR, "An Algorithm for Determining the Endpoints
       of Isolated Utterances", Bell System Technical Journal, Vol 54,
       No. 2, pp 297-315, 1975.
     * Drago, P.G. et al. "Digital Dynamic Speech Detectors." IEEE Trans
       on Communications, Vol 26, No 1, Jan 78, pp. 140-145.

  Q2.5: WHAT SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES ARE USED IN SPEECH TECHNOLOGY?
  
   This question is far to big to be answered in a FAQ posting.
   Fortunately there are many good books which answer the question. Some
   good introductory books include
     * Digital processing of speech signals; L. R. Rabiner, R. W.
       Schafer. Englewood Cliffs; London: Prentice-Hall, 1978
     * Voice and Speech Processing; T. W. Parsons. New York; McGraw Hill
       1986
     * Computer Speech Processing; ed Frank Fallside, William A. Woods
       Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, c1985
     * Digital speech processing : speech coding, synthesis, and
       recognition edited by A. Nejat Ince; Kluwer Academic Publishers,
       Boston, c1992
     * Speech science and technology; edited by Shuzo Saito pub. Ohmsha,
       Tokyo, c1992
     * Speech analysis; edited by Ronald W. Schafer, John D. Markel New
       York, IEEE Press, c1979
     * Douglas O'Shaughnessy -- Speech Communication: Human and Machine
       Addison Wesley series in Electrical Engineering: Digital Signal
       Processing, 1987.

  Q2.6: WHAT SPEECH SAMPLING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING HARDWARE CAN I USE?
  
   In addition to the following information, have a look at the Audio
   File format document prepared by Guido van Rossum (see details in
   Section 1.8).
   
   Can anyone provide information on Mac, SGI, NeXT and other hardware?
   
    Sun standard audio port: SPARC I & II
     * Input and Output: 1 channel, 8 bit mu-law encoded, 8kHz sample
       rate. This provides telephone quality sampling.
       
    Sun standard audio port (SPARC 10 & 20)
     * Input and Output: Stereo (2 channels). 16-bit linear sampling.
       Multiple sample rates (48000, 44100, 37800, 32000, 22050, 18900,
       16000, 11025, 9600, 8000 Hz)
       
    Macintosh Audio Hardware - an overview
     * Description: ALL Macintosh computers come with the ability to
       play back sounds at any sample rate (sample rate conversion is
       done in software.) Older machines have 8 bit stereo output
       (hardware runs at 22254 samples/second). The newer machines have
       16 bit stereo hardare running at 44100 samples/second.
       
       Most of the recent Macintosh computers come with sound input
       hardware. There are probably exceptions to this, but the older and
       some of the current low-end machines have 8 bit (linear) mono
       hardware running at 22254.54 samples/second. All of the PowerPC,
       AV, and the 500 series notebook computers come with 16 bit 44kHz
       stereo sampling hardware. They can also record at 22050
       samples/second. The sound manager implements an AGC (Automatic
       Gain Control) function for the 8 bit hardware. The drivers have a
       switch to turn off the AGC.
       
       There are a number of DSP vendors that support high quality audio.
       Generally this means quieter analog sections, and more IO formats
       (AES/IBU, for example). Try DigiDesign and Spectral Innovations.
       
       The software drivers for sound are described in "Inside Macintosh:
       Sound". If you want to see some sample code check out the sources
       for the Matlab "Sound and Image Toolbox". They can be found at
          + ftp://ftp.apple.com/pub/malcolm/SoundAndImageToolbox.cpt.hqx
   
       Routines that play and record sounds using the toolbox are
       included (and interfaced to Matlab).

    IBM RS/6000 ACPA (Audio Capture and Playback Adapter)
     * Description: The card supports PCM, Mu-Law, A-Law and ADPCM at
       44.1kHz (& 22.05, 11.025, 8kHz) with 16-bits of resolution in
       stereo. The card has a built-in DSP (don't know which one). The
       device also supports various formats for the output data, like
       big-endian, twos complement, etc. Good noise immunity.
       
       The card is used for IBM's VoiceServer (they use the DSP for
       speech recognition). Apparently, the IBM voiceserver has a
       speaker-independent vocabulary of over 20,000 words and each ACPA
       can support two independent sessions at once.

  Q2.7: HOW DO I CONVERT TO/FROM MU-LAW FORMAT?
  
   Mu-law coding is a form of compression for audio signals including
   speech. It is widely used in the telecommunications field because it
   improves the signal-to-noise ratio without increasing the amount of
   data. Typically, mu-law compressed speech is carried in 8-bit samples.
   It is a companding technqiue. That means that carries more information
   about the smaller signals than about larger signals.
   
   On SUN Sparc systems have a look in the directory /usr/demo/SOUND.
   Included are table lookup macros for ulaw conversions. [Note however
   that not all systems will have /usr/demo/SOUND installed as it is
   optional - see your system admin if it is missing.]
   
   OR, here is some sample conversion code in C.

int ulaw2linear(/* unsigned char */);

  Q3.3: WHAT SPEECH COMPRESSION/CODING SOFTWARE IS AVAILABLE?
  
   Note: there are two types of speech compression technique referred to
   below. Lossless technqiues preserve the speech through a
   compression-decompression phase. Lossy techniques do not preserve the
   speech prefectly. As a general rule, the more you compress speech, the
   more the quality degardes.

FAQ SECTION 4 - Natural Language Processing

   There is now a newsgroup specifically for Natural Language Processing.
   It is called comp.ai.nat-lang.
   
   There is also a lot of useful information on Natural Language
   Processing in the FAQ for comp.ai. That FAQ lists available software
   and useful references. It includes a substantial list of software,
   documentation and other info available by ftp.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q4.1: WHAT ARE SOME GOOD REFERENCES/BOOKS ON NLP?
  
   Take a look at the FAQ for the "comp.ai" newsgroup as it also includes
   some useful references.
     * James Allen: Natural Language Understanding, (Benjamin/Cummings
       Series in Computer Science) Menlo Park: Benjamin/Cummings
       Publishing Company, 1987.
          + This book consists of four parts: syntactic processing,
            semantic interpretation, context and world knowledge, and
            response generation.
     * G. Gazdar and C. Mellish, Natural Language Processing in Prolog,
       Addison Wesley, 1989
     * G. Gazdar and C. Mellish, Natural Language Processing in Lisp,
       Addison Wesley, 1989
     * G. Gazdar and C. Mellish, Natural Language Processing in Pop11,
       Addison Wesley, 1989
          + Emphasis on parsing, especially unification-based parsing,
            lots of details on the lexicon, feature propagation, etc.
            Fair coverage of semantic interpretation, inference in
            natural language processing, and pragmatics; much less
            extensive than in Allen's book, but more formal. There are
            three versions, one for each programming language listed
            above, with complete code.
     * Shapiro, Stuart C.: Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence Vol.1
       and 2. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1990.
          + There are articles on the different areas of natural language
            processing which also give additional references.
     * Paris, Ce'cile L.; Swartout, William R.; Mann, William C.:
       Natural Language Generation in Artificial Intelligence and
       Computational Linguistics. Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers,
       1991.
          + The book describes the most current research developments in
            natural language generation and all aspects of the generation
            process are discussed. The book is comprised of three
            sections: one on text planning, one on lexical choice, and
            one on grammar.
     * Readings in Natural Language Processing, ed by B. Grosz, K.
       Sparck Jones and B. Webber, Morgan Kaufmann, 1986
          + A collection of classic papers on Natural Language
            Processing. Fairly complete at the time the book came out
            (1986) but now seriously out of date. Still useful for ATN's,
            etc.
     * Klaus K. Obermeier, Natural Language Processing Technologies in
       Artificial Intelligence: The Science and Industry Perspective,
       Ellis Horwood Ltd, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, England, 1989.
       
    Journals
    
   The major journals of the field are
     * Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science for the
       artificial intelligence aspects,
     * Cognition for the psychological aspects,
     * Language and Linguistics and Philosophy and Linguistic
       Inquiry for the linguistic aspects.
     * Artificial Intelligence occasionally has papers on natural
       language processing.
       
    Conferences
    
   The major conferences of the field are
     * ACL (held every year)
     * and COLING (held every two years). Most AI conferences have a NLP
       track; AAAI, ECAI, IJCAI and the Cognitive Science Society
       conferences usually are the most interesting for NLP. CUNY is an
       important psycholinguistic conference. There are lots of
       linguistic conferences: the most important seem to be NELS, the
       conference of the Chicago Linguistic Society (CLS), WCCFL, LSA,
       the Amsterdam Colloquium, and SALT.
