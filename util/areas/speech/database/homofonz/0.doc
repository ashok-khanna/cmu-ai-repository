Summary:      List of homophones in General American English

Version:      1.01 (17-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains a list of homophones in "General American
   English". Homophones are words that "sound the same" but are spelled
   differently. For example, "bear" and "bare" are homophones, but "bear"
   (noun) and "bear" (verb) are not.

   This list is based on the book "Handbook of Homophones" by William
   Cameron Townsend, 1975.
