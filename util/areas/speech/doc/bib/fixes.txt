Hello,

and thanks a *lot* for putting together the ai repository. It will no
doubt make life a lot easier for numerous researchers world-wide.

I just wanted to point out a small detail: I ftp:ed the
"software/nlp/speech/speech.bib" database of bibtex style references,
but I had some minor problems with typos etc. I thought that you, or
whoever it was that put together that collection, might be intrested
in knowing about this. Below, I've included a 'diff' between the
original file and the one containing my hand-made corrections. There
was also quite a few warnings from bibtex concerning some of the
strings not being defined, or some of the entries being doubly
defined. I've included a transcript of that as well. Hope this is of
some use.

Regards, 

Anders L.
