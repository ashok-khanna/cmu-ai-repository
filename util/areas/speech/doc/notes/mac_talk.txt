Listing of Speech Manager/MacInTalk Pro/PlainTalk aware applications, 4e
 
Here are some of the Speech Manager aware text-to-speech (TTS)
applications that I know of (there are more on the Apple Developer
CD-ROMs). If I've missed some, please feel free to add to the list
and also let me know if you disagree with my "Comments." You'll
probably need to increase the memory allocations of Speech Manager
aware applications if you want to use the high quality voices (I
generally add a Meg or two because the high quality voices need a lot
of RAM).As for some applications, the ones I've been playing with
follow.
 
Apple's Speech Manager, with the high quality voices, has a
synthesized voice quality and pronunciation that are among the best
I've heard (Bellcore's Orator might do better with proper nouns). Do
you agree? Has anyone done formal testing of the Speech Manager vs
other TTS systems?
 
If anyone has a Speech Manager aware application that allows
graphical specification of pitch and rate trajectories (akin to
SoundEdit's Bender), I'd love to hear about it.
 
The Speech Manager is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in
/dts/mac/sys.soft/speech. There are 3 files in this directory:
