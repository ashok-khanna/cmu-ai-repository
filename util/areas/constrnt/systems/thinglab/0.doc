Name:         ThingLabII

Summary:      Constraint-based user interfaces

Version:      v2 (20-MAY-90)

Description: 

   ThingLab II supports the exploration of constraint-based user
   interfaces. It consists of a set of classes that define constraints
   and constrainable objects called things. It also includes an
   incremental constraint satisfier, a module compiler, a
   construction-set style user interface, various tools, and an
   extensible set of primitive user interface building blocks.
