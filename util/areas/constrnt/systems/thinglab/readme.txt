The second release of ThingLab II consists of the following files:

	README			-- this file
	ThingLabII.v2.st	-- Smalltalk code for the basic system
	Things.v2.st		-- Smalltalk code for the Primitive Things
	Demos.v2.st		-- Smalltalk code for a set of Demos (optional)
	ThingLabII.form		-- startup picture (optional)
	ThingManual.text	-- the manual, in plain text form
	ThingManual.word3.02	-- the manual, in Word 3.02 form

Please see the manual for installation directions. You'll need ParcPlace
Smalltalk-80 version 2.3 for the system to run correctly.  (There are no
plans to port it to a more recent version of Smalltalk.)

When FTP-ing these files, use ASCII mode for all files except ThingLabII.form
and ThingManual.word3.02, which should be transfered in BINARY mode.

========================================

In addition to the files listed above, the file SIGGRAPH_Demo.tar.Z is a
compressed tar file containing a ThingLab II demo prepared for a SIGGRAPH
tutorial by Bjorn Freeman-Benson.  It runs on the Macintosh under System 6.x.
SIGGRAPH-Demo.st.Z is the corresponding source file (which runs only under
ParcPlace release 2.3).
