There is a list of Frequently Asked Questions for the area of
constraints. It is automatically posted in two parts on the 17th of
each month. It is also available by ftp or on WWW at all times.

This announcement is NOT the FAQ; it is a meta-FAQ. It will be posted
around the beginning of each month, just as a reminder of the location
of the main FAQ.

NOTE: the WWW page associated with the FAQ now contains far more
information than the FAQ does, including meta-information, i.e. pointers
to other WWW pages and ftp sites. I strongly suggest you have a look at it:
	http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/archive/constraints/constraints.html

Obtain the FAQ by anonymous ftp from City University:
	ftp.cs.city.ac.uk [138.40.91.9],
 using username "anonymous" and password "name@host".
 The files part1 and part2 are located in the directory
	pub/constraints/constraints-faq/

The FAQ postings are also archived in the periodic posting archive on
rtfm.mit.edu. Look in the anonymous ftp directory
/pub/usenet/news.answers/constraints-faq in the files part1 and part2.
If you do not have anonymous ftp access, you can access the archive by
mail server as well. Send an E-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with "help" and "index" in the body on separate lines for more
information.

FAQs and Resource Guides for other newsgroups will usually be available
on rtfm.mit.edu too.
