Welcome to The MathWorks FTP server!

The purpose of this site is to provide a place where MATLAB
users can access archives of:

	1. User contributed M-files
	2. Product announcements and information
	3. Digests and other Documentation
	4. Patches and bug fixes

 It is also a place where users can submit M-files or MEX
files to be placed in the archive.

Below is a overall map of what-is-where in this archive.

=================================================================
                     Directory structure
=================================================================

/incoming: Submit your M-files here for inclusion in the archive
          (be sure to read README.incoming before placing files here)

/pub/doc : Archive of documentation, tutorials, help info, etc.

/pub/contrib : User contributed M/MEX files and tools *

/pub/product-info: The MathWorks product literature

/pub/patch: Post-release bug fixes and enhancement of MATLAB

/pub/tech-support: Directory used by MathWorks technical support


Files with a ".sh" extension are shar archives. To unbundle them
(on a Unix machine),

	sh filename.sh

a directory called "filename" will be created containing the 
resulting files.
