Summary:      A Simulation Environment for Fuzzy Logic Control Systems

Version:      1.1 (23-MAR-94)

Description: 

   xfuzzy is an X-Windows based simulation tool for fuzzy controllers
   that runs on Sun workstations.

   The kernel of xfuzzy consists of the software implementation of a
   fuzzy inference engine. The modules defining the behavior of the
   controller (Fuzzifier, Rules Set, and Defuzzifier) and the system
   being controlled (model) interact with this inference engine. The
   environment is completed with a user interface which, through a group
   of menus, eases the tasks of editing the membership functions, rules,
   and the system model, as well as the graphic presentation of the
   simulation results.

   The closing of the feedback loop of the complete system (controller +
   system under control) is accomplished by means of a program in C,
   provided by the user according to the directions contained in a
   template file supplied by the environment. This module is dynamically
   linked to the inference engine, allowing the user to perform the whole
   tuning of the controller without exiting the environment.
