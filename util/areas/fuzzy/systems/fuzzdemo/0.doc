Name:         FuzzDemo

Summary:      MATLAB demo of parameterizing membership functions and
              learning in fuzzy inference systems.

Version:      1-SEP-93

Description: 

   This directory contains MATLAB *.m files (V4.0) for demonstrating
   several ways of parameterizing membership functions (MF) and
   learning in fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Specifically, it includes

        (a) manual tuning of MF's
        (b) animation of MF's to show the effects of different parameters
        (c) animation of MF's and the overall input/output behavior of FIS.
        (d) learning (parameter identification) in FIS using
                1. Simplex method
                2. Simplex method + least-squares method

   This is a prototype suitable for educational purposes.
