Summary:      Simulation of a Fuzzy Inverted Pendulum Controller

Version:      15-OCT-92

Description: 

   This directory contains DOS executable and source code for a
   simulation of an inverted pendulum with a variable weight and variable
   motor strength. The pendulum is controlled by a fuzzy logic knowledge
   base.  This is *not* the classical inverted pendulum which uses the
   sliding "cart"; instead, this system just has a motor connected to the
   pendulum.  It's only intended as a simple example of a fuzzy control
   system.  It's not trying to prove anything.

   The fuzzy logic knowledge base was developed with the Togai InfraLogic
   Fuzzy-C Development System. All source code is supplied.
