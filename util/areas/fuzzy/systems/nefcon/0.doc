Name:         NEFCON

Summary:      InterViews-based graphical simulation environment for
              Neural Fuzzy Controllers 

Version:      1.0 (16-JUN-94)

Description: 

   NEFCON-I (NEural Fuzzy CONtroller) is an X11 simulation environment
   based on Interviews designed to build and test neural fuzzy
   controllers.  NEFCON-I is able to learn fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules by
   using a kind of reinforcement learning that is driven by a fuzzy error
   measure.  To do this NEFCON-I communicates with another process, that
   implements a simulation of a dynamical process.  NEFCON-I can optimize
   the fuzzy sets of the antecedents and the conclusions of a given rule
   base, and it can also create a rulebase from scratch.
