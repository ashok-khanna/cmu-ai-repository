This note is for all of you in universities who sent me mail on how 
to get the Motorola Fuzzy Logic Education Kits.  Hopefully this 
will help you find the kits without dealing with salesman and/or 
distributors. 
 
                   Here are the specifics:

FLEDKT05(Education Kit with M68HC05EVM) $600.00
FLEDKT11(Education Kit with M68HC11EVM) $600.00
FLEDKT00(Education Kit without EVM)     $195.00
        FuzzBasic - just the CBT course $ 68.80
 
The Motorola Education Kit includes:
        *Computer Based Training disks on Fuzzy logic
        *Aptronix Fide Demonstration system (can save your work)
                Windows based tool with visual debugging tools
                for developing fuzzy logic applications.
        *Motorola's KBG V2.22 DOS tools for fuzzy logic 
 
     The CBT course runs in MS Windows 3.0 or 3.1. and provides 
     nearly 500 screens of colorful and interactive material 
     that covers the following subjects:
     
             * Fundamentals of fuzzy logic
             * Methodology of design for embedded control
             * Aptronix fuzzy inference development environment
             * A fuzzy logic project
             * Advanced topics
             * Introduction to neural networks
             * Glossary of terms
             * Further reading
             * Review questions at the end of each section
 
     The methodology of design section includes:
     
             * How to analyze and partition the control system
             * Defining input and output surfaces
             * Writing rules
             * Observing model behavior, verifying and tuning as needed 
             * Optimizing systems for target platforms
     
     The advanced topics area includes:
     
             * Alpha Cuts
             * Assertions
             * Compatibility Index
             * Contribution weights
             * Stability weights
             * Adaptability
             * Fuzzy calculus
             * Noise, randomness, ambiguity
             * Higher order fuzzy sets
             * Geometric Representations
   
     I hope you find this helpful.
