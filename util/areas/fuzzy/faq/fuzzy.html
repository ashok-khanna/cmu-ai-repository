Subject: [1] What is the purpose of this newsgroup?
Date: 15-APR-93

The comp.ai.fuzzy newsgroup was created in January 1993, for the purpose
of providing a forum for the discussion of fuzzy logic, fuzzy expert
systems, and related topics.

================================================================
Subject: [2] What is fuzzy logic?
Date: 15-APR-93

Fuzzy logic is a superset of conventional (Boolean) logic that has been
extended to handle the concept of partial truth -- truth values between
"completely true" and "completely false".  It was introduced by Dr. Lotfi
Zadeh of UC/Berkeley in the 1960's as a means to model the uncertainty
of natural language. (Note: Lotfi, not Lofti, is the correct spelling
of his name.)

Zadeh says that rather than regarding fuzzy theory as a single theory, we
should regard the process of ``fuzzification'' as a methodology to
generalize ANY specific theory from a crisp (discrete) to a continuous
(fuzzy) form (see "extension principle" in [2]). Thus recently researchers
have also introduced "fuzzy calculus", "fuzzy differential equations",
and so on (see [7]).

Fuzzy Subsets:

Just as there is a strong relationship between Boolean logic and the
concept of a subset, there is a similar strong relationship between fuzzy
logic and fuzzy subset theory.

In classical set theory, a subset U of a set S can be defined as a
mapping from the elements of S to the elements of the set {0, 1},

   U: S --> {0, 1}

This mapping may be represented as a set of ordered pairs, with exactly
one ordered pair present for each element of S. The first element of the
ordered pair is an element of the set S, and the second element is an
element of the set {0, 1}.  The value zero is used to represent
non-membership, and the value one is used to represent membership.  The
truth or falsity of the statement

    x is in U

is determined by finding the ordered pair whose first element is x.  The
statement is true if the second element of the ordered pair is 1, and the
statement is false if it is 0.

Similarly, a fuzzy subset F of a set S can be defined as a set of ordered
pairs, each with the first element from S, and the second element from
the interval [0,1], with exactly one ordered pair present for each
element of S. This defines a mapping between elements of the set S and
values in the interval [0,1].  The value zero is used to represent
complete non-membership, the value one is used to represent complete
membership, and values in between are used to represent intermediate
DEGREES OF MEMBERSHIP.  The set S is referred to as the UNIVERSE OF
DISCOURSE for the fuzzy subset F.  Frequently, the mapping is described
as a function, the MEMBERSHIP FUNCTION of F. The degree to which the
statement

    x is in F

is true is determined by finding the ordered pair whose first element is
x.  The DEGREE OF TRUTH of the statement is the second element of the
ordered pair.

In practice, the terms "membership function" and fuzzy subset get used
interchangeably.

That's a lot of mathematical baggage, so here's an example.  Let's
talk about people and "tallness".  In this case the set S (the
universe of discourse) is the set of people.  Let's define a fuzzy
subset TALL, which will answer the question "to what degree is person
x tall?" Zadeh describes TALL as a LINGUISTIC VARIABLE, which
represents our cognitive category of "tallness". To each person in the
universe of discourse, we have to assign a degree of membership in the
fuzzy subset TALL.  The easiest way to do this is with a membership
function based on the person's height.

    tall(x) = { 0,                     if height(x) < 5 ft.,
                (height(x)-5ft.)/2ft., if 5 ft. <= height (x) <= 7 ft.,
                1,                     if height(x) > 7 ft. }

A graph of this looks like:

1.0 +                   +-------------------
    |                  /
    |                 /
0.5 +                /
    |               /
    |              /
0.0 +-------------+-----+-------------------
                  |     |
                 5.0   7.0

                height, ft. ->

Given this definition, here are some example values:

Person    Height    degree of tallness
--------------------------------------
Billy     3' 2"     0.00 [I think]
Yoke      5' 5"     0.21
Drew      5' 9"     0.38
Erik      5' 10"    0.42
Mark      6' 1"     0.54
Kareem    7' 2"     1.00 [depends on who you ask]

Expressions like "A is X" can be interpreted as degrees of truth,
e.g., "Drew is TALL" = 0.38.

Note: Membership functions used in most applications almost never have as
simple a shape as tall(x). At minimum, they tend to be triangles pointing
up, and they can be much more complex than that.  Also, the discussion
characterizes membership functions as if they always are based on a
single criterion, but this isn't always the case, although it is quite
common.  One could, for example, want to have the membership function for
TALL depend on both a person's height and their age (he's tall for his
age).  This is perfectly legitimate, and occasionally used in practice.
It's referred to as a two-dimensional membership function, or a "fuzzy
relation".  It's also possible to have even more criteria, or to have the
membership function depend on elements from two completely different
universes of discourse.

Logic Operations:

Now that we know what a statement like "X is LOW" means in fuzzy logic,
how do we interpret a statement like

    X is LOW and Y is HIGH or (not Z is MEDIUM)

The standard definitions in fuzzy logic are:

    truth (not x)   = 1.0 - truth (x)
    truth (x and y) = minimum (truth(x), truth(y))
    truth (x or y)  = maximum (truth(x), truth(y))

Some researchers in fuzzy logic have explored the use of other
interpretations of the AND and OR operations, but the definition for the
NOT operation seems to be safe.

Note that if you plug just the values zero and one into these
definitions, you get the same truth tables as you would expect from
conventional Boolean logic. This is known as the EXTENSION PRINCIPLE,
which states that the classical results of Boolean logic are recovered
from fuzzy logic operations when all fuzzy membership grades are
restricted to the traditional set {0, 1}. This effectively establishes
fuzzy subsets and logic as a true generalization of classical set theory
and logic. In fact, by this reasoning all crisp (traditional) subsets ARE
fuzzy subsets of this very special type; and there is no conflict between
fuzzy and crisp methods.

Some examples -- assume the same definition of TALL as above, and in addition,
assume that we have a fuzzy subset OLD defined by the membership function:

    old (x) = { 0,                      if age(x) < 18 yr.
                (age(x)-18 yr.)/42 yr., if 18 yr. <= age(x) <= 60 yr.
                1,                      if age(x) > 60 yr. }

And for compactness, let

    a = X is TALL and X is OLD
    b = X is TALL or X is OLD
    c = not (X is TALL)

Then we can compute the following values.

height  age     X is TALL       X is OLD        a       b       c

Subject: [3] Where is fuzzy logic used?
Date: 15-APR-93

Fuzzy logic is used directly in very few applications. The Sony PalmTop
apparently uses a fuzzy logic decision tree algorithm to perform
handwritten (well, computer lightpen) Kanji character recognition.

Most applications of fuzzy logic use it as the underlying logic system
for fuzzy expert systems (see [4]).

================================================================
Subject: [4] What is a fuzzy expert system?
Date: 21-APR-93

A fuzzy expert system is an expert system that uses a collection of
fuzzy membership functions and rules, instead of Boolean logic, to
reason about data. The rules in a fuzzy expert system are usually of a
form similar to the following:

    if x is low and y is high then z = medium

where x and y are input variables (names for know data values), z is an
output variable (a name for a data value to be computed), low is a
membership function (fuzzy subset) defined on x, high is a membership
function defined on y, and medium is a membership function defined on z.
The antecedent (the rule's premise) describes to what degree the rule
applies, while the conclusion (the rule's consequent) assigns a
membership function to each of one or more output variables.  Most tools
for working with fuzzy expert systems allow more than one conclusion per
rule. The set of rules in a fuzzy expert system is known as the rulebase
or knowledge base.

The general inference process proceeds in three (or four) steps. 

1. Under FUZZIFICATION, the membership functions defined on the
   input variables are applied to their actual values, to determine the
   degree of truth for each rule premise.

2. Under INFERENCE, the truth value for the premise of each rule is
   computed, and applied to the conclusion part of each rule.  This results
   in one fuzzy subset to be assigned to each output variable for each
   rule.  Usually only MIN or PRODUCT are used as inference rules. In MIN
   inferencing, the output membership function is clipped off at a height
   corresponding to the rule premise's computed degree of truth (fuzzy
   logic AND). In PRODUCT inferencing, the output membership function is
   scaled by the rule premise's computed degree of truth.

3. Under COMPOSITION, all of the fuzzy subsets assigned to each output
   variable are combined together to form a single fuzzy subset 
   for each output variable.  Again, usually MAX or SUM are used. In MAX
   composition, the combined output fuzzy subset is constructed by taking
   the pointwise maximum over all of the fuzzy subsets assigned tovariable
   by the inference rule (fuzzy logic OR).  In SUM composition, the
   combined output fuzzy subset is constructed by taking the pointwise sum
   over all of the fuzzy subsets assigned to the output variable by the
   inference rule.

4. Finally is the (optional) DEFUZZIFICATION, which is used when it is
   useful to convert the fuzzy output set to a crisp number.  There are
   more defuzzification methods than you can shake a stick at (at least
   30). Two of the more common techniques are the CENTROID and MAXIMUM
   methods.  In the CENTROID method, the crisp value of the output variable
   is computed by finding the variable value of the center of gravity of
   the membership function for the fuzzy value.  In the MAXIMUM method, one
   of the variable values at which the fuzzy subset has its maximum truth
   value is chosen as the crisp value for the output variable.

Extended Example:

Assume that the variables x, y, and z all take on values in the interval
[0,10], and that the following membership functions and rules are defined:

  low(t)  = 1 - ( t / 10 )
  high(t) = t / 10

  rule 1: if x is low and y is low then z is high
  rule 2: if x is low and y is high then z is low
  rule 3: if x is high and y is low then z is low
  rule 4: if x is high and y is high then z is high

Notice that instead of assigning a single value to the output variable z, each
rule assigns an entire fuzzy subset (low or high).

Notes:

1. In this example, low(t)+high(t)=1.0 for all t.  This is not required, but 
   it is fairly common.

2. The value of t at which low(t) is maximum is the same as the value of t at
   which high(t) is minimum, and vice-versa.  This is also not required, but
   fairly common.

3. The same membership functions are used for all variables.  This isn't
   required, and is also *not* common.


In the fuzzification subprocess, the membership functions defined on the
input variables are applied to their actual values, to determine the
degree of truth for each rule premise.  The degree of truth for a rule's
premise is sometimes referred to as its ALPHA.  If a rule's premise has a
nonzero degree of truth (if the rule applies at all...) then the rule is
said to FIRE. For example,

x       y       low(x)  high(x) low(y)  high(y) alpha1  alpha2  alpha3  alpha4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     0.0     0.0
0.0     3.2     1.0     0.0     0.68    0.32    0.68    0.32    0.0     0.0
0.0     6.1     1.0     0.0     0.39    0.61    0.39    0.61    0.0     0.0
0.0     10.0    1.0     0.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     0.0
3.2     0.0     0.68    0.32    1.0     0.0     0.68    0.0     0.32    0.0
6.1     0.0     0.39    0.61    1.0     0.0     0.39    0.0     0.61    0.0
10.0    0.0     0.0     1.0     1.0     0.0     0.0     0.0     1.0     0.0
3.2     3.1     0.68    0.32    0.69    0.31    0.68    0.31    0.32    0.31
3.2     3.3     0.68    0.32    0.67    0.33    0.67    0.33    0.32    0.32
10.0    10.0    0.0     1.0     0.0     1.0     0.0     0.0     0.0     1.0


In the inference subprocess, the truth value for the premise of each rule is
computed, and applied to the conclusion part of each rule.  This results in
one fuzzy subset to be assigned to each output variable for each rule.

MIN and PRODUCT are two INFERENCE METHODS or INFERENCE RULES.  In MIN
inferencing, the output membership function is clipped off at a height
corresponding to the rule premise's computed degree of truth.  This
corresponds to the traditional interpretation of the fuzzy logic AND
operation.  In PRODUCT inferencing, the output membership function is
scaled by the rule premise's computed degree of truth.

For example, let's look at rule 1 for x = 0.0 and y = 3.2.  As shown in the
table above, the premise degree of truth works out to 0.68.  For this rule, 
MIN inferencing will assign z the fuzzy subset defined by the membership
function:

    rule1(z) = { z / 10, if z <= 6.8
                 0.68,   if z >= 6.8 }

For the same conditions, PRODUCT inferencing will assign z the fuzzy subset
defined by the membership function:

    rule1(z) = 0.68 * high(z)
             = 0.068 * z

Note: The terminology used here is slightly nonstandard.  In most texts,
the term "inference method" is used to mean the combination of the things
referred to separately here as "inference" and "composition."  Thus
you'll see such terms as "MAX-MIN inference" and "SUM-PRODUCT inference"
in the literature.  They are the combination of MAX composition and MIN
inference, or SUM composition and PRODUCT inference, respectively.
You'll also see the reverse terms "MIN-MAX" and "PRODUCT-SUM" -- these
mean the same things as the reverse order.  It seems clearer to describe
the two processes separately.


In the composition subprocess, all of the fuzzy subsets assigned to each
output variable are combined together to form a single fuzzy subset for each
output variable.

MAX composition and SUM composition are two COMPOSITION RULES.  In MAX
composition, the combined output fuzzy subset is constructed by taking
the pointwise maximum over all of the fuzzy subsets assigned to the
output variable by the inference rule.  In SUM composition, the combined
output fuzzy subset is constructed by taking the pointwise sum over all
of the fuzzy subsets assigned to the output variable by the inference
rule.  Note that this can result in truth values greater than one!  For
this reason, SUM composition is only used when it will be followed by a
defuzzification method, such as the CENTROID method, that doesn't have a
problem with this odd case. Otherwise SUM composition can be combined
with normalization and is therefore a general purpose method again.

For example, assume x = 0.0 and y = 3.2.  MIN inferencing would assign the
following four fuzzy subsets to z:

      rule1(z) = { z / 10,     if z <= 6.8
                   0.68,       if z >= 6.8 }

      rule2(z) = { 0.32,       if z <= 6.8
                   1 - z / 10, if z >= 6.8 }

      rule3(z) = 0.0

      rule4(z) = 0.0

MAX composition would result in the fuzzy subset:

      fuzzy(z) = { 0.32,       if z <= 3.2
                   z / 10,     if 3.2 <= z <= 6.8
                   0.68,       if z >= 6.8 }


PRODUCT inferencing would assign the following four fuzzy subsets to z:

      rule1(z) = 0.068 * z
      rule2(z) = 0.32 - 0.032 * z
      rule3(z) = 0.0
      rule4(z) = 0.0

SUM composition would result in the fuzzy subset:

      fuzzy(z) = 0.32 + 0.036 * z


Sometimes it is useful to just examine the fuzzy subsets that are the
result of the composition process, but more often, this FUZZY VALUE needs
to be converted to a single number -- a CRISP VALUE.  This is what the
defuzzification subprocess does.

There are more defuzzification methods than you can shake a stick at.  A
couple of years ago, Mizumoto did a short paper that compared about ten
defuzzification methods.  Two of the more common techniques are the
CENTROID and MAXIMUM methods.  In the CENTROID method, the crisp value of
the output variable is computed by finding the variable value of the
center of gravity of the membership function for the fuzzy value.  In the
MAXIMUM method, one of the variable values at which the fuzzy subset has
its maximum truth value is chosen as the crisp value for the output
variable.  There are several variations of the MAXIMUM method that differ
only in what they do when there is more than one variable value at which
this maximum truth value occurs.  One of these, the AVERAGE-OF-MAXIMA
method, returns the average of the variable values at which the maximum
truth value occurs.

For example, go back to our previous examples.  Using MAX-MIN inferencing
and AVERAGE-OF-MAXIMA defuzzification results in a crisp value of 8.4 for
z.  Using PRODUCT-SUM inferencing and CENTROID defuzzification results in
a crisp value of 5.6 for z, as follows.

Earlier on in the FAQ, we state that all variables (including z) take on
values in the range [0, 10].  To compute the centroid of the function f(x),
you divide the moment of the function by the area of the function.  To compute 
the moment of f(x), you compute the integral of x*f(x) dx, and to compute the
area of f(x), you compute the integral of f(x) dx.  In this case, we would
compute the area as integral from 0 to 10 of (0.32+0.036*z) dz, which is

    (0.32 * 10 + 0.018*100) =
    (3.2 + 1.8) =
    5.0

and the moment as the integral from 0 to 10 of (0.32*z+0.036*z*z) dz, which is

    (0.16 * 10 * 10 + 0.012 * 10 * 10 * 10) =
    (16 + 12) =
    28

Finally, the centroid is 28/5 or 5.6.

Note: Sometimes the composition and defuzzification processes are
combined, taking advantage of mathematical relationships that simplify
the process of computing the final output variable values.

Controls", in Proceedings of the 3rd IFSA Congress, pages 60-62, 1989.

Subject: [5] Where are fuzzy expert systems used?
Date: 15-APR-93

To date, fuzzy expert systems are the most common use of fuzzy logic.  They
are used in several wide-ranging fields, including:
   o  Linear and Nonlinear Control
   o  Pattern Recognition
   o  Financial Systems
   o  Operation Research
   o  Data Analysis

================================================================
Subject: [6] What is fuzzy control?
Date: 17-MAR-95

The purpose of control is to influence the behavior of a system by
changing an input or inputs to that system according to a rule or
set of rules that model how the system operates. The system being
controlled may be mechanical, electrical, chemical or any combination
of these.

Classic control theory uses a mathematical model to define a relationship
that transforms the desired state (requested) and observed state (measured)
of the system into an input or inputs that will alter the future state of
that system.

  reference----->0------->( SYSTEM ) -------+----------> output
                 ^                          |
                 |                          |
                 +--------( MODEL )<--------+feedback

The most common example of a control model is the PID (proportional-integral-
derivative) controller. This takes the output of the system and compares
it with the desired state of the system. It adjusts the input value based
on the difference between the two values according to the following
equation.
                       
      output =  A.e + B.INT(e)dt + C.de/dt

Where, A, B and C are constants, e is the error term, INT(e)dt is the
integral of the error over time and de/dt is the change in the error term.

The major drawback of this system is that it usually assumes that the system
being modelled in linear or at least behaves in some fashion that is a
monotonic function. As the complexity of the system increases it becomes
more difficult to formulate that mathematical model.

Fuzzy control replaces, in the picture above, the role of the mathematical
model and replaces it with another that is build from a number of smaller
rules that in general only describe a small section of the whole system. The
process of inference binding them together to produce the desired outputs.

That is, a fuzzy model has replaced the mathematical one. The inputs and
outputs of the system have remained unchanged.

The Sendai subway is the prototypical example application of fuzzy control.

Subject: [7] What are fuzzy numbers and fuzzy arithmetic?
Date: 15-APR-93

Fuzzy numbers are fuzzy subsets of the real line. They have a peak or
plateau with membership grade 1, over which the members of the
universe are completely in the set.  The membership function is
increasing towards the peak and decreasing away from it.

Fuzzy numbers are used very widely in fuzzy control applications. A typical
case is the triangular fuzzy number 

1.0 +                   +
    |                  / \
    |                 /   \
0.5 +                /     \
    |               /       \
    |              /         \

                  |     |     |
                 5.0   7.0   9.0

which is one form of the fuzzy number 7. Slope and trapezoidal functions
are also used, as are exponential curves similar to Gaussian probability
densities.

Subject: [8] Isn't "fuzzy logic" an inherent contradiction? 
              Why would anyone want to fuzzify logic?
Date: 15-APR-93

Fuzzy sets and logic must be viewed as a formal mathematical theory for
the representation of uncertainty. Uncertainty is crucial for the
management of real systems: if you had to park your car PRECISELY in one
place, it would not be possible. Instead, you work within, say, 10 cm
tolerances. The presence of uncertainty is the price you pay for handling
a complex system.

Nevertheless, fuzzy logic is a mathematical formalism, and a membership
grade is a precise number. What's crucial to realize is that fuzzy logic
is a logic OF fuzziness, not a logic which is ITSELF fuzzy. But that's
OK: just as the laws of probability are not random, so the laws of
fuzziness are not vague.

================================================================
Subject: [9] How are membership values determined?
Date: 15-APR-93

Determination methods break down broadly into the following categories:

1. Subjective evaluation and elicitation

   As fuzzy sets are usually intended to model people's cognitive states,
   they can be determined from either simple or sophisticated elicitation
   procedures. At they very least, subjects simply draw or otherwise specify
   different membership curves appropriate to a given problem. These
   subjects are typcially experts in the problem area. Or they are given a
   more constrained set of possible curves from which they choose. Under
   more complex methods, users can be tested using psychological methods.

2. Ad-hoc forms

   While there is a vast (hugely infinite) array of possible membership
   function forms, most actual fuzzy control operations draw from a very
   small set of different curves, for example simple forms of fuzzy numbers
   (see [7]). This simplifies the problem, for example to choosing just the
   central value and the slope on either side.

3. Converted frequencies or probabilities

   Sometimes information taken in the form of frequency histograms or other
   probability curves are used as the basis to construct a membership
   function. There are a variety of possible conversion methods, each with
   its own mathematical and methodological strengths and weaknesses.
   However, it should always be remembered that membership functions are NOT
   (necessarily) probabilities. See [10] for more information.

4. Physical measurement

   Many applications of fuzzy logic use physical measurement, but almost
   none measure the membership grade directly. Instead, a membership
   function is provided by another method, and then the individual
   membership grades of data are calculated from it (see FUZZIFICATION in [4]).

5. Learning and adaptation

================================================================
Subject: [10] What is the relationship between fuzzy truth values and
             probabilities?
Date: 21-NOV-94

This question has to be answered in two ways: first, how does fuzzy 
theory differ from probability theory mathematically, and second, how 
does it differ in interpretation and application.

At the mathematical level, fuzzy values are commonly misunderstood to be 
probabilities, or fuzzy logic is interpreted as some new way of handling 
probabilities.  But this is not the case.  A minimum requirement of 
probabilities is ADDITIVITY, that is that they must add together to one, or 
the integral of their density curves must be one.

But this does not hold in general with membership grades.  And while 
membership grades can be determined with probability densities in mind (see 
[11]), there are other methods as well which have nothing to do with 
frequencies or probabilities.

Because of this, fuzzy researchers have gone to great pains to distance
themselves from probability. But in so doing, many of them have lost track
of another point, which is that the converse DOES hold: all probability
distributions are fuzzy sets! As fuzzy sets and logic generalize Boolean
sets and logic, they also generalize probability.

In fact, from a mathematical perspective, fuzzy sets and probability exist 
as parts of a greater Generalized Information Theory which includes many 
formalisms for representing uncertainty (including random sets, 
Demster-Shafer evidence theory, probability intervals, possibility theory, 
general fuzzy measures, interval analysis, etc.).  Furthermore, one can 
also talk about random fuzzy events and fuzzy random events.  This whole 
issue is beyond the scope of this FAQ, so please refer to the following 
articles, or the textbook by Klir and Folger (see [16]).

Semantically, the distinction between fuzzy logic and probability theory 
has to do with the difference between the notions of probability and a 
degree of membership.  Probability statements are about the likelihoods of 
outcomes: an event either occurs or does not, and you can bet on it.  But 
with fuzziness, one cannot say unequivocally whether an event occured or 
not, and instead you are trying to model the EXTENT to which an event 
occured. This issue is treated well in the swamp water example used by 
James Bezdek of the University of West Florida (Bezdek, James C, "Fuzzy 
Models --- What Are They, and Why?", IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 
1:1, pp.  1-6).

Subject: [11] Are there fuzzy state machines?
Date: 15-APR-93

Yes. FSMs are obtained by assigning membership grades as weights to the
states of a machine, weights on transitions between states, and then a
composition rule such as MAX/MIN or PLUS/TIMES (see [4]) to calculate new
grades of future states. Refer to the following article, or to Section
III of the Dubois and Prade's 1980 textbook (see [16]).

================================================================
Subject: [12] What is possibility theory?
Date: 15-APR-93

Possibility theory is a new form of information theory which is related
to but independent of both fuzzy sets and probability theory.
Technically, a possibility distribution is a normal fuzzy set (at least
one membership grade equals 1). For example, all fuzzy numbers are
possibility distributions. However, possibility theory can also be
derived without reference to fuzzy sets.

The rules of possibility theory are similar to probability theory, but
use either MAX/MIN or MAX/TIMES calculus, rather than the PLUS/TIMES
calculus of probability theory. Also, possibilistic NONSPECIFICITY is
available as a measure of information similar to the stochastic
ENTROPY.

Possibility theory has a methodological advantage over probability theory
as a representation of nondeterminism in systems, because the PLUS/TIMES
calculus does not validly generalize nondeterministic processes, while
MAX/MIN and MAX/TIMES do.

    The mailing list server itself is like most of those in use on the
    Internet.  If you're already familiar with Internet mailing lists, the
    only thing you'll need to know is that the name of the server is

       listproc@listproc.gsu.edu 

    and the name of the mailing list itself is

       nafips-l@listproc.gsu.edu 

    If you're not familiar with this type of mailing list server, the
    easiest way to get started is to send the following message to
    listproc@listproc.gsu.edu:
       help 
    You will receive a brief set of instructions by email within
    a short time.

    Once you have subscribed, you will begin receiving a copy of each message
    that is sent by anyone to nafips-l@listproc.gsu.edu, and any message that 
    you send to that address will be sent to all of the other subscribers.

Technical University of Vienna Fuzzy Logic Mailing List:

    This is a mailing list for the discussion of fuzzy logic and related
    topics, located at the Technical University of Vienna in Austria.  The
    last time this FAQ was updated, there were about 980 subscribers.
    The list is slightly moderated (only irrelevant mails are rejected)
    and is two-way gatewayed to the aforementioned NAFIPS-L list and to
    the comp.ai.fuzzy internet newsgroup. Messages should therefore be
    sent only to one of the three media, although some mechanism for
    mail-loop avoidance and duplicate-message avoidance is activated.
    In addition to the mailing list itself, the list server gives
    access to some files, including archives and the "Who is Who in Fuzzy
    Logic" database that is currently under construction by Robert Fuller
    <rfuller@finabo.abo.fi>. There is also a WWW interface to the list
    at http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/marchives/fuzzy-mail/index.html as well
    as a ftp://mira.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/pub/mlowner site to access such
    files as the whoiswhoinfuzzy file mentioned above.

    Like many mailing lists, this one uses Anastasios Kotsikonas's LISTPROC
    system.  If you've used this kind of server before, the only thing you'll
    need to know is that the name of the server is
      listproc@dbai.tuwien.ac.at
    and the name of the mailing list is
      fuzzy-mail@dbai.tuwien.ac.at

    If you're not familiar with this type of mailing list server, the easiest
    way to get started is to send the following message to
    listproc@dbai.tuwien.ac.at:
      get fuzzy-mail info

    You will receive a brief set of instructions by email within a short time.

    Once you have subscribed, you will begin receiving a copy of each message
    that is sent by anyone to fuzzy-mail@dbai.tuwien.ac.at, and any
    message that you send to that address will be sent to all of the other
    subscribers.

Fuzzy Logic in Japan:

    There are two mailing lists for fuzzy logic in Japan. Both forward
    many articles from the international mailing lists, but the other
    direction is not automatic. 

    Asian Fuzzy Mailing System (AFMS):
       afuzzy@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp

       To subscribe, send a message to aserver@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp
       with your name and email address. Membership is restricted to
       within Asia as a general rule.

       The list is executed manually, and is maintained by Prof. Mikio
       Nakatsuyama, Department of Electronic Engineering, Yamagata
       University, 4-3-16 Jonan, Yonezawa 992 Japan, phone +81-238-22-5181, 
       fax +81-238-24-2752, email nakatsu@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp. 

       All messages to the list have the Subject line replaced with "AFMS".
       The language of the list is English.

    Fuzzy Mailing List - Japan:
       fuzzy-jp@sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp

       This is an unmoderated list, with mostly original contributions
       in Japanese (JIS-code).

       To subscribe, send subscriptions to the listserv
          fuzzy-jp-request@sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp

       If you need to speak to a human being, send mail to the list
       owners, 
          fuzzy-admin@tamlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp
       Itsuo Hatono and Motohide Umano of Osaka University.

Fril Systems Ltd:

   FRIL (Fuzzy Relational Inference Language) is a logic-programming
   language that incorporates a consistent method for handling
   uncertainty, based on Baldwin's theories of support logic, mass
   assignments, and evidential reasoning. Mass assignments give a
   consistent way of manipulating fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainties,
   enabling different forms of uncertainty to be integrated within a
   single framework. Fril has a list-based syntax, similar to the early
   micro-Prolog from LPA. Prolog is a special case of Fril, in which
   programs involve no uncertainty. Fril runs on Unix, Macintosh,
   MS-DOS, and Windows 3.1 platforms.

  NeuFuz is aimed at low end controls applications in automotive, 
  industrial, and appliance areas.  NeuFuz is a neural-fuzzy technology 
  which uses backpropagation techniques to initially select fuzzy rules 
  and membership functions.  Initial stages of design using NeuFuz 
  technology are performed using training data and backpropagation.  
  The result is a fuzzy associative memory (FAM) which implements an 
  approximation of the training data.  By implementing a FAM, rather 
  than a multi-layer perceptron, the designer has a solution which can 
  be understood and tuned to a particular application using Fuzzy Logic 
  design techniques.

Subject: [21] Elkan's "The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic" paper

The presentation of Elkan's AAAI-93 paper 
   Charles Elkan, "The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic", in
   Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial
   Intelligence, 698-703, 1993.
has generated much controversy. The fuzzy logic community claims that
the paper is based on some common misunderstandings about fuzzy logic, but
Elkan still maintains the correctness of his proof. (See, for
instance, AI Magazine 15(1):6-8, Spring 1994.) 

Elkan proves that for a particular set of axiomatizations of fuzzy
logic, fuzzy logic collapses to two-valued logic. The proof is correct
in the sense that the conclusion follows from the premises. The
disagreement concerns the relevance of the premises to fuzzy logic.
At issue are the logical equivalence axioms. Elkan has shown that if
you include any of several plausible equivalences, such as
   not(A and not B) == (not A and not B) or B
with the min, max, and 1- axioms of fuzzy logic, then fuzzy logic
reduces to binary logic. The fuzzy logic community states that these
logical equivalence axioms are not required in fuzzy logic, and that
Elkan's proof requires the excluded middle law, a law that is commonly
rejected in fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic researchers must simply take care
to avoid using any of these equivalences in their work.

It is difficult to do justice to the issues in so short a summary.
Readers of this FAQ should not assume that this summary is the last
word on this topic, but should read Elkan's paper and some of the
other correspondence on this topic (some of which has appeared in the
comp.ai.fuzzy newsgroup). 

Two responses to Elkan's paper, one by Enrique Ruspini and the other
by Didier Dubois and Henri Prade, may be found as
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/fuzzy/doc/elkan/response.txt

A final version of Elkan's paper, together with responses from members
of the fuzzy logic community, will appear in an issue of IEEE Expert
sometime in 1994. A paper by Dubois and Prade will be presented at AAAI-94.

Subject: [22] Glossary

Hedge		

   A hedge is a one-input truth value manipulation operation. It modifies
   the shape of the truth function, in a manner analogous to the function
   of adjectives and adverbs in English. Some examples that are commonly seen
   in the literature are intensifiers like "very", detensifiers like
   "somewhat", and complementizers like "not".  One might define "very x"
   as the square of the truth value of x, and define "somewhat x" as the
   square root of the truth value of x.  Then you can make fuzzy logic
   statements like:
       y is very low
   which would evaluate to (y is low) * (y is low).  One can think of
   "not x" as being a hedge in the same sense, defining "not x" as one
   minus the truth value of x.

================================================================
Subject: [24] Where to send calls for papers (cfp) and calls for participation
Date: 15-MAY-95

Fuzzy related calls for papers and calls for participation should be
sent by email to conferences@iao.fhg.de, or posted to the moderated
newsgroup news.announce.conferences. Both actions will have the same
effect. Please keep Subject lines informative; if space permits,
mention the topic and location there, and avoid acronyms unless very
widely known. Submissions will simultaneously appear in the newsgroup
news.announce.conferences and on the WorldWideWeb server of
Fraunhofer-IAO at <URL:http://www.iao.fhg.de/Library/conferences> as
soon as they have been processed.  The fuzzy-mail mailing list (see
[15]) scans this news-group for items related to fuzzy and uncertainty.
Matching messages will be moderated like any other message sent to the
mailing list, and if selected, will be forwarded to the Asian
fuzzy-mailing list (see [15]), NAFIPS-L (see [15]), as well as the
internet news-group comp.ai.fuzzy (see [1]).  Sending it only to
conferences@iao.fhg.de is normally enough to distribute the message
efficiently to all the other media.
