A B S T R A C T :

This book gives a survey of recent developments in fuzzy technology
in Germany. The main topics are:

- Fuzzy Control
- Fuzzy Neuro Systems
- Fuzzy Systems in Artificial Intelligence
- Theory of Fuzzy Systems
- Fuzzy Classification

All chapters start with an authoritative introduction to the main issues
of the respective field, involving the state of the art.
The subsequent papers in each chapter address recent deliverables and
describe new ideas regarding the improvement of fuzzy systems.
These deliverables are extended reviewed versions of contributions
that were presented at the first Workshop "Fuzzy-Systeme '93' in Braunschweig,
Germany, October 21-22, 1993. This workshop was organized by the
the German Society of Computer Science (GI), the German Academy of Computer
Science (DIA), and the University of Braunschweig, reflecting the
work of the new trade group "Fuzzy-Systeme" as a subsection of the
committee "1.2. Inferenzsysteme" of GI.
All important research groups that work in the field of fuzzy systems
in Germany attended the Braunschweig Workshop. 
Further workshops will take place every year at another location in Germany.
The second Workshop "Fuzzy-Systeme '94" will be organized in Munich on
October 21-22, 1994, invited speakers: L.A. Zadeh, L. Koczy).
