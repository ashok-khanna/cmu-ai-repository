Fuzzy technology for CA-Clipper

Mgr. Juraj Durov, Mgr. Jaroslav Kostelansky
Aria Ltd., Slovakia

The DB-fuzzy library for Clipper  is designed to develop informa-
tion systems in which the information retrieval is based on ambi-
guous  and/or incomplete  data.  In  addition, the  fuzzy library
allows the  transformation of the  user's requests formulated  in
common language  into a query statement  providing an output ade-
quately reflecting the original request. DB-fuzzy is based on the
modified set theory, so called theory of fuzzy sets.

The theory of fuzzy sets

The  theory of  fuzzy sets  (ThFS) originated  in 1965 when Prof.
Lotfi A.  Zadeh from California  University, Berkeley, introduced
an idea  of fuzzy set which  is a central concept  of the theory.
According to one language dictionary,  a fuzzy set is a generali-
zation of the  classical set allowing for various  degrees of set
membership  instead  of  all  or  none.  This  means that a value
between 0  and 1, the degree  of membership in the  fuzzy set, is
assigned to each element. The membership of an element in a given
fuzzy set increases  with increasing value of the  degree of mem-
bership. The ThFS starts from  this simple and natural idea allo-
wing  the theory  to adapt  in an  environment of uncertainty and
inaccuracy which  is inherent to  the real world.  The word fuzzy
also corresponds to  the theory base and it  may be understood as
not sharp, dim, vague or uncertain.

Although  the original  attitude of  "black-and-white" mathemati-
cians was rejected, the theory  of fuzzy sets was under theoreti-
cal investigations.  Today this theory  belongs to well-developed
and appreciated  mathematical theories. First  practical applica-
tions appeared in Japan around 1987.

Applying the theory

In recent years fuzzy  technologies are becoming increasingly em-
bedded in a wide range of applications. As an illustration we can
mention for  example the recognition  of hand-written characters,
video-camera with automatic search of the central point of pictu-
re to  focus on and compensating  the hand-shimmering and braking
system ABS in the cars. The fuzzy approach popularity has increa-
sed mainly  for enormous success of  fuzzy logic controllers that
successfully simulate  human operations. Even  though fuzzy logic
is used worldwide, the leading country is Japan with its many re-
search programs,  big financial support and  almost all top indu-
strial companies accepted this new trend.

Information retrieval from databases belongs to various fields of
theory applications.  In this context, the  main advantage of the
ThFS is  its ability to  perform mathematically also  the vaguely
specified information,  and thus to  process this information  by
the computer techniques. The need  to work with inaccurate and/or
incomplete  information is  due to  the fact  that in almost each
description of a reality is always present some measure of 
uncertainty.

The DB-fuzzy library

The use of  a fuzzy library is justified  in the situations when-
ever the  classical tools of  information retrieval are  insuffi-
cient. For example, such a situation  may occur if we cannot ret-
rieve information needed due to  the inaccurate or lack of suffi-
cient data identifying it. The  DB-fuzzy allows to represent such
data in a query the output of which are records more or less fit-
ting the input data in the query. That means that we get also the
records  not strictly  fitting the  input data.  In this way, the
inaccurateness or incompletness of data,  by which we are retrie-
ving, is accepted. This steps up the probability of obtaining the
information needed. Another advantage of the fuzzy library is its
ability to  transform requests formulated in  the common language
into the query statements in which it is possible to adapt vague-
ly specified information. The output  is the evaluated set of re-
cords where  their value reflects  how the records  fit the given
query. In such  way, we are able to select  the most suitable al-
ternative  adequate to  the original  requests formulated  in the
common language.

The main  difference between classical and  fuzzy approaches con-
sists in dealing with the output set of records fitting the query
as if it  was a fuzzy set. The degrees  of membership assigned to
the records reflect the measure  of relevancy to the query. Using
the DB-fuzzy we simply obtain for  each record a real number bet-
ween 0 and  1 expressing to what extent  a particular record fits
the query. The higher the  assigned value the more the correspon-
ding record fits  the given query. In other  words, a record res-
ponding to the query is neither selected nor unselected but it is
evaluated to what  extent it fits the given  query. The evaluated
output  obtained in  this way  can be  sorted in decreasing order
according to  assigned values of  the degree of  membership. That
means that the records that are the most appropriate to the query
are at  the top and the  degree of membership decreases  with the
rate of relevancy.  The ability of the DB-fuzzy  consists just in
the adequate calculation of the degree of membership, i.e. of the
real number from the interval < 0, 1>.

In a  classical approach, the output  consists of the set  of re-
cords that  unambiguously fit the conditions  given in the query.
That means that the logic of query evaluation is bivalent - a re-
cord from an  input set either belongs to the  output set or not.
There is, therefore, no distinction among the records in the sen-
se of relevancy  to a given query. All the  records in the output
set are considered to be equivalently  right or wrong. It is unp-
leasant that a user does not realize this mistake because the ba-
sic defect is not in providing the irrelevant information but, on
the contrary, not providing the relevant one.

A practical example

A concrete use of the fuzzy library is demonstrated in an example
from business activities. This example  is based on the selection
of the most  appropriate alternative. Let's say that  we are loo-
king for eligible candidates for a new joint company according to
the following requirements:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
| The main requirement is the high profit and turn-over of the  |
| company in last year, with emphasis on the profit.            |
|                                                               |
| Less important requirement is the sales representative of the |
| company in U.S.A., Canada, or Mexico, or if need be in all    |
| three contries, while the priority is put on the sales        |
| representative in U.S.A. and the representative in Mexico is  |
| the least important.                                          |
|                                                               |
| In addition, it would be useful if the company is medium-sized|
| as to the number of employees while the a wide net of         |
| distribution outlets, i.e. a certain number of shops is       |
| required at the same time. The wide net of distribution       |
| outlets is more important.                                    |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| The profit exceeding approximately 8 percent and the turn-over|
| exceeding 600 milions are  considered high. The medium-sized  |
| company means the company with about 100 employees and wide   |
| net of distribution outlets means the net  with number        |
| of shops approximately exceeding 15.                          |
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As it can be seen, the requirements formulated in common language
contain vague terms (e.g.  high, medium-sized, wide, approximate-
ly) and,  a different importance  (e.g. the main,  priority, more
important) is attributed  to the various parts of  the query. The
result  (see  table  below)  is  illustrated  on test input using
DB-fuzzy   functions,   and   will   be   investigated   how  the
above-mentioned requirements are accepted.  The output is ordered
by the value  of the degree of membership  (see score below) that
reflects the measure of the candidate's acceptability.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  |company profit  turn.  sales represent.  emp.  net  score |
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  |   E   | 10.40 | 1050 | US, Can.       | 115 | 14 | 0.716 |
  |   I   | 10.40 |  890 | US, Can.       | 115 | 14 | 0.715 |
  |   H   | 12.50 |  880 | US, Can.       | 115 | 11 | 0.671 |
  |   C   | 12.50 |  880 | US, Mex.       | 115 | 11 | 0.651 |
  |   A   |  9.05 | 1050 | US, Can.       | 115 | 14 | 0.650 |
  |   G   |  9.70 |  880 | US, Can., Mex. | 100 | 11 | 0.647 |
  |   D   | 12.50 |  880 | Can., Mex.     | 115 | 11 | 0.644 |
  |   F   | 13.62 |  925 | US, Can.       |  35 |  7 | 0.586 |
  |   B   | 13.62 |  925 | Slovakia       |  97 | 21 | 0.443 |
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  The evaluation of acceptable candidates for a joint company

Company B  that is medium-sized  with a wide  net of distribution
outlets but  without sales representative  in any required  coun-
tries, is on the output after  company F, however this one is not
both medium-size and with wide net of distribution outlets but it
has a  sales representative in the  U.S.A. as well as  in Canada.
The profit and turn-over are  the same for both. This classifica-
tion follows from  the fact that the second  query requirement is
more important than the third one.

The differences between  the companies H, C and  D consist in the
sales representatives.  Both companies H and  C have sales repre-
sentatives in the U.S.A. but the  H has the representative in Ca-
nada and C in  Mexico. That is why H has a  higher degree of mem-
bership than C.  It is due to the least  importance of the repre-
sentative in Mexico within this  query requirement. The degree of
comapny D without representative in  the U.S.A. is lower than the
degree of company C because of the priority given to U.S.A.

The difference between companies H and  G is among others in much
lower profit  of company G. This  is the reason why  company G is
ratec lower  than H despite  of sales representatives  in all re-
quired countries  and the absolute satisfaction  of the condition
on medium-sized  company. This evaluation  follows from the  fact
that the second and the third  requirements of the query are less
important than the first one as well as from the emphasis on high
profit in the first requirement. Mexico  and the size of the com-
pany in the  second and third requirements were  also less impor-
tant.

The company E with higher turn-over and wider net of distributors
than company H was assigned a  higher degree than H despite a li-
ttle lower  profit. Also the  company I is  better evaluated than
the H. Company  I differs from E by  the lower turn-over. Company
A with lower profit than E was assigned a lower degree than H. It
is therefore evident that the  calculated degree of membership is
based on all the characteristics of candidates.

As you can see from the above, the assigned degrees of membership
adequately  reflect  the  acceptability  or  non-acceptability of
a candidate.  It should  be pointed  out that  it would  be quite
difficult to evaluate the candidates in the means of conventional
tools  of information  retrieval systems  even though  using such
a relatively small input.

Concluding remarks
The advantages  of DB-fuzzy use  become more important  if larger
input sets are used when the  end-user is able to examine top re-
cords, i.e. the  ones with the highest value  or only the records
with the degree higher than a given threshold value. In this way,
it is possible  to solve partly also such a  problem as is an in-
formation overload when the user has no chance to process all the
relevant  information. By  processing according  to the relevancy
evaluation, the user can be quite sure that he processed the most
essential information he was able to.

The fuzzy library allows the  writing of software which simulates
the thinking process of humans. In real life, the majority of de-
cisions is  not based on  accurate or absolute  values. The human
decision is  determined mostly by incomplete  information that in
summary describes the problem being solved. Single information is
more or less precise or  true and one attributes different impor-
tance or  priority to them.  The dispositions of  the DB-fuzzy to
work with inaccurate data allow, in the field of data processing,
to create an attractive class of applications, so called decision
support systems. Recently, these  systems marked to be unsuitable
to be used for automation  on account of their inaccurate parame-
ters andd they could not cope  with the classical tools of infor-
mation processing.
