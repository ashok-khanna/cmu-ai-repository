Togai InfraLogic, Inc. was founded in August of 1987 by Dr. Masaki
Togai.  We specialize the fuzzy logic and fuzzy expert systems,
supplying software and hardware development systems, chip- and
board-level hardware products, and engineering services.  Some of our
standard products include the following:

Software Products
-----------------

  TILShell
  --------

    TILShell is a graphical CASE tool for fuzzy expert system
    development.  It interfaces directly with all of the TIL software
    and hardware development systems.  TILShell is available for IBM
    PC and NEC PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows, and for Sun
    Sparc workstations running SunOS and OpenWindows.

  Fuzzy-C Development System
  --------------------------

    The Fuzzy-C Development System (FCDS) is a set of tools that
    revolve around a compiler that converts a fuzzy expert system
    described in FPL, the Fuzzy Programming Language, into an
    implementation in ANSI or K&R C source code.  The generated source
    code is fully stand-alone, requiring no runtime module and no
    license fees.  The FCDS is available for IBM PC and NEC PC
    compatibles running PC-DOS or MS-DOS, and for Sun Sparc
    workstations running SunOS.

  FC110 Development System
  ------------------------

    The FC110 Development System (FC110DS) supplies a relocatable
    assembler, linker, and an FPL compiler that generates relocatable
    FC110 machine code.  It supports development targeted at the FC110
    Digital Fuzzy Processor described below.  The FC110DS is available
    for IBM PC and NEC PC compatibles running PC-DOS or MS-DOS, and
    for Sun Sparc workstations running SunOS.

  MicroFPL Development System
  ---------------------------

    The MicroFPL Development System (MFPLDS) contains an FPL compiler
    that generates a compact internal form for a fuzzy expert system
    coded in FPL, and a runtime module to interpret that form.  It is
    intended to support the use of fuzzy techniques on embedded
    microcontrollers.  Several versions of the MFPLDS, hosted on the
    IBM PC or NEC PC compatibles running PC-DOS or MS-DOS, are
    available for the following target microprocessor families:

        Hitachi HMCS400
        Hitachi H8/300
        Hitachi H8/500
        Intel 8051
        Mitsubishi 37450
        Motorola MC68HC11
        Oki 66201

  TILGen
  ------

    TILGen is a tool for automatically constructing fuzzy expert
    systems from data sampled from an existing system.  It uses a
    technique first described by Dr. Bart Kosko as Differential
    Competitive Learning (DCL).  TILGen is available for IBM- and NEC-
    compatible PCs, and Sun Sparcs.  All targets for TILGen include a
    command line version. In addition, a graphical version of TILGen,
    which requires Microsoft Windows 3.1, is supplied with the IBM- and
    NEC-compatible targets.

Hardware Products
-----------------

  FC110 Digital Fuzzy Processor
  -----------------------------

    The FC110 Digital Fuzzy Processor is an all-CMOS high speed fuzzy
    microprocessor that is capable of acting either as a stand-alone
    processor or a fuzzy accelerator for a host processor.  It is
    capable of fully processing up to 220,000 2-input, 1-output rules
    per second.

  FCA10AT FC110 Board for IBM PC/AT
  ---------------------------------

    The FCA10AT board contains a single FC110, along with a full 128
    KB (64K words) of knowledge base memory (RAM).  The FC110 and the
    knowledge base memory are fully accessible by the host IBM PC.

  FCD10SA FC110 Development Module
  --------------------------------

    The FCD10SA board contains an FC110 DFP, a socket for a 128KB
    EPROM, an oscillator, an extended address decoder, and a connector
    and ribbon cable to allow it to be connected to a host system.  It
    can be used as a development tool, or built into an existing
    system with a minimum of change to the existing system.

  FCD10SB FC110 Single Board Fuzzy Controller
  -------------------------------------------

    The FCD10SB Single Board Fuzzy Controller contains an FC110 DFP,
    an oscillator, a socket for a 128KB EPROM, an 8-channel A/D, a
    4-channel D/A, a serial port, a parallel port, timers, and an
    interface connector through which the FC110 and all of its
    peripherals can be accessed by a host processor.  It is intended
    to be used as a stand-alone fuzzy control module on a single
    board.

  FCD10SBus FC110 Board for Sbus
  ------------------------------

    The FCD10SBus board contains two complete FC110 subsystems, each
    including an FC110 and a full 128 KB of knowledge base RAM.  The
    FC110s operate completely independently of each other, and can be
    used to perform completely separate tasks.  The FC110s and the
    knowledge base memory are fully accessible from the host
    processor, which is usually a Sun Sparcstation of some kind.

  FCA10VME FC110 Board for VME
  ----------------------------

    The FCA10VME board contains four complete FC110 subsystems, each
    including an FC110 and a full 128 KB of knowledge base RAM.  The
    FC110s operate completely independently of each other, and can be
    used to perform completely separate tasks.  The FC110s and the
    knowledge base memory are fully accessible from the host
    processor.

  Fuzzy Computational Acceleration - FCA (tm)
  -------------------------------------------

    FCA is TIL's second-generation approach to hardware implementation of
    fuzzy logic processing.  Where the FC110 is a single chip, FCA is a
    core design for fuzzy ASICs that can easily be scaled from 8 bit to
    32 bit precision.  It requires only modest die area, and provides
    approximately five times the performance of the FC110.

    VLSI Technology has recently announced that it will make cores based
    on FCA available to its ASIC customers as part of its standard core
    line.
