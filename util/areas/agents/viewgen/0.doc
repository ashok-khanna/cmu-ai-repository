Summary:      Viewpoint Generator

Version:      

Description: 

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see
   References).  This can be seen as a form of agent modeling tool,
   which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep nested belief
   spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs that are
   typically held by groups of agents.

   The theory of belief ascription upon which ViewGen is based is
   described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general 
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation. See the
   readme.txt file for an abstract.

Requires:     

Ports:        ViewGen is implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence
              easily convertible to any Edinburgh-style prolog.
