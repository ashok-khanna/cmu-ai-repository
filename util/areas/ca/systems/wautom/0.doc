Name:         Wautom

Summary:      Cellular automata simulator for PCs.

Version:      1.0 (28-NOV-93)

Description: 
 
   WAUTOM is a simulator for 1-dimensional elementary binary cellular 
   automata (3-cell neighbors), with Wolfram's rules 0 to 255. WA2D is
   similar, but for 2d automata (4-cell neighbors). WAUTNN simulates the
   behavior of 1d binary CA with 5-cell neighbors.

   2DHODGE is a simulator for the 2D "hodge-podge machine" with generic k
   states and other parameters.

Requires:     IBM PC 286 or better with VGA/mouse.
