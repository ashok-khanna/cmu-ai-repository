Summary:      UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases and Domain Theories

Version:      2-JUN-94

Description: 

   The UC/Irvine (UCI) Repository of Machine Learning Databases and
   Domain Theories contains over 99 benchmark data sets for classifier
   systems (30mb). These data sets have been or can be used to
   evaluate learning algorithms.

   Note: Three of the databases (the Ljubljana breast-cancer,
   lymphography, and primary-tumor databases) have restricted access
   and hence are not available by anonymous ftp. They are available to
   individuals in academia upon request by contacting the UCI
   Repository maintainers directly.

                    Learning Repository can be gotten directly from
