Summary:      Refinement With Macros

Version:      17-NOV-92

Description: 

   RWM (Refinement With Macros) is an interactive system for learning
   problem solving strategies. RWM incorporates two techniques, namely
   Refinement and Macro Generation. The input to the RWM is the definition
   of a problem, the output is a strategy for solving the given problem.
   A strategy is a sequence of subproblems which are easier then the original
   problem, and when solved in the the given order it yields a solution
   for the original problem.

Requires:     Common Lisp 

Ports:        Tested under Lucid CL.
