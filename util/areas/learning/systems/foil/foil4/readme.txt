        This directory contains a version in C of the program FOIL - FOIL4.1

        (FOIL4.1 is a modification to FOIL4.0 to fix a recently discovered
bug which dates back to FOIL2).

        The file "MANUAL" contains an explanation of the form of the input and
the options. The file "OVERVIEW" contains a description of the method used
by FOIL.

        The executable version of the program may be made with the command
"make foilgt" (or "make foil4" for the slower version for debugging).

        A trivial example input file, "list.d", is provided to demonstrate
the program, and may be used with the command "foil4 < list.d". The output
from this is given in "list.out" - as it contains execution time information,
the results from your system may well differ in this respect! Further comments
on list.d and list.out are provided in list.explain.

        Several other example files (*.d) are also provided for your use. The
names of these should be sufficiently mnemonic to enable recognition from
the literature.

        This version of FOIL was produced by Mike Cameron-Jones deriving from
the original by Ross Quinlan. Hence, queries, bug reports, improvements,
etc should be sent to me, Mike Cameron-Jones (mcj@cs.su.oz.au), in the first
instance. In the event that I don't reply to you adequately quickly, get
in touch with Ross Quinlan (quinlan@cs.su.oz.au).

	I'd appreciate it if you could mail me to let me know you've taken
a copy of FOIL, so that we have some idea who has copies.

                Mike Cameron-Jones, 10th May 1993
