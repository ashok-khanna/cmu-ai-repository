----------------------------------------------------------
			ANNOUNCEMENT

	A new release of the PEBLS system, PEBLS 3.0,
        is now available via anonymous FTP.
----------------------------------------------------------

     PEBLS is a nearest-neighbor learning system designed for
applications where the instances have symbolic feature values.  PEBLS
has been applied to the prediction of protein secondary structure and
to the identification of DNA promoter sequences.  A technical
description appears in the article by Cost and Salzberg, Machine
Learning journal 10:1 (1993).

     PEBLS 3.0 is written entirely in ANSI C. It is thus capable of
running on a wide range of platforms.  Version 3.0 incorporates a
number of additions to version 2.1 (released in 1993) and to the
original PEBLS described in the paper:

     S. Cost and S. Salzberg.  A Weighted Nearest Neighbor 
     Algorithm for Learning with Symbolic Features,
     Machine Learning, 10:1, 57-78 (1993).

     PEBLS 3.0 now makes it possible to draw more comparisons between
nearest-neighbor and probabilistic approaches to machine learning, by
incorporating a capability for tracking statistics for Bayesian
inferences.  The system can thus serve to show specifically where
nearest-neighbor and Bayesian methods differ.  The system is also able
to perform tests using simple distance metrics (overlap, Euclidean,
Manhattan) for baseline comparisons.  Research along these lines was
described in the following paper:

     J. Rachlin, S. Kasif, S. Salzberg, and D. Aha.  Towards a Better
     Understanding of Memory-Based and Bayesian Classifiers.  {\it
     Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Machine
     Learning} (pp. 242--250).  New Brunswick, NJ, July 1994, Morgan
     Kaufmann Publishers.
