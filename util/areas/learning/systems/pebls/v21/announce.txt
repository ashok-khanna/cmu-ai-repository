			ANNOUNCEMENT

	PEBLS 2.0 is now available via Anonymous FTP.
----------------------------------------------------------

     PEBLS (Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System) is a
nearest-neighbor learning system designed for applications
where the instances have symbolic feature values.  PEBLS has
been applied to the prediction of protein secondary
structure based on the primary amino acid sequence of
protein sub-units, and to the identification of DNA promoter
sequences.  A technical description appears in the article
by Cost and Salzberg, Machine Learning journal 10:1 (1993).

     PEBLS 2.0 is a serial version written entirely in ANSI
C. PEBLS 2.0 incorporates a number of features intended 
to support flexible experimentation in symbolic domains.  We
have provided support for k-nearest neighbor learning, and
the ability to choose among different techniques for
weighting both exemplars and individual features.  A number
of post-processing techniques specific to the domain of
protein secondary structure have also been provided.
