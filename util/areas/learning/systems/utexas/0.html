This directory contains a copy of the machine learning programs and
publications made available by the machine learning group under
Raymond Mooney at UT-Austin.

There are four subdirectories:

   course/   information and homeworks from a graduate course
             in machine learning taught by Dr. Mooney. Homeworks
             include "miniatures" of various machine learning
             systems written in Common Lisp.

   code/     Common Lisp code corresponding to the assignments
             for the course in the course directory.

   progs/    More "research-level" versions of inductive
             classification algorithms and software for automated
             experiments that generation learning curves that
             compare several systems. 

   papers/   Publications produced by the machine learning
             research group.
