This directory contains papers from past conferences as well as current work
submitted for publication. The "abstracts" file contains a list of abstracts
associated with each of the papers. Included is a full citation for the paper.

Before you copy any papers, be sure to be in binary mode (not ascii). After you
have downloaded the files you will need to do something like the following to
print them out:

  unix> uncompress papername.ps.Z
  unix> lpr -P <laser-printer> papername.ps
