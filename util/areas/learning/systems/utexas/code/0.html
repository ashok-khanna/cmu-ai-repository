<H2>ML-Code: Lisp Code for Assignments in Mooney's Machine 
              Learning Course</H2>

This directory contains a copy of the Common Lisp code
corresponding to the assignments for the graduate course in machine
learning taught by Dr. Mooney.

The programs include:

  1. AQ algorithms for learning from examples. Uses either beam
     search with bounded stars or the version space algorithm to
     compute stars.

 2. BACKPROP.

 3. COBWEB.  Incremental conceptual clustering algorithm (with
    soybean data). 

 4. DEDUCE. Prolog-like theorem prover or deductive retrieval
    system. Uses generators to retrieve one answer at a time and
    also generates proofs. Supports only backward chaining, with
    optional depth bound on the number of rules.

 5. EGGS. Explanation-Based Generalizer. EGGS can generalize the
    proofs returned by DEDUCE and generate macro-rules from the
    general proofs. These macro-rules are stored and preferentially
    used in future deductions to increase performance.

6. EXPLORER. In the spirit of AM, but more limited. Explores a
   space of concepts, guided by "interestingness" measures and
   makes conjectures about the concepts it explores. 

7. ID3 algorithm for learning from examples. Produces decision trees
   discriminating positive and negative instances.

8. PERCEPTRON.  Simple system for learning from examples
   using the perceptron learning procedure to adjust a set of
   weights on a single linear threshold unit until all of the
   training examples are correctly classified. 

9. VERSION-SPACE algorithm for incremental learning from examples.
