Name:         FOCL

Summary:      Expert System Shell and Machine Learning Program

Version:      2.1 (21-APR-94)

Description: 

   FOCL is an expert system shell and machine learning program written in
   Common Lisp. The machine learning program extends Quinlan's FOIL
   program by containing a compatible explanation-based learning
   component.  FOCL learns Horn Clause programs from examples and
   (optionally) background knowledge. The expert system includes a
   backward-chaining rule interpreter and a graphical interface to the
   rule and fact base. 

   The Macintosh version includes a graphical interface that displays the
   search space explored by FOCL, so it is a useful pedagogical tool.
   This application also contains a graphical interface for building rule
   bases, so you can ignore the machine learning aspects, and use it as
   an expert system shell with the following capabilities:

      +  A backward-chaining rule interpreter.

      +  A graphical rule and fact editor.

      +  Graphical display of the rule base.

      +  (Simple) Natural language explanation of inferences

      +  Menu-based facilities for editing rules and adding natural language
         translations to rules.

      +  Optional typing of variables and checking the rule base for type
         conflicts 

      +  Tracing of rules

      +  Analysis of the accuracy of rules in a rule base.

   Sample rule bases are included.

   The Common Lisp source code is limited to portable source code for
   the machine learning program only, since the interface depends on
   the Macintosh.
