Hi, 
People keep asking me refences about DAI, BBA  and ATC. Following
is the some of the references that I used when I was doing my thesis.

Many of the research BB architectures listed in the references remain
available via FTP.  For example, the UMass GBB system can be FTP'ed
from dime.cs.umass.edu.  BB1 and GEST are also available via FTP from
Stanford and GaTech.

Note also that the term "blackboard system" has been applied to a
number of shared-memory and distributed systems that range far from
the original blackboard paradigm.  One should always look beyond
the "blackboard" label before assuming how such systems actually
function.
