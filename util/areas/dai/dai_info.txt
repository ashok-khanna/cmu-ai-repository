Good Morning Everybody

Here is the proposed summary of the responses to my question regarding
distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) on comp.ai and  comp.ai.shells.
It also has been included in the DAI-List Digest 106. (This seems to be
a periodic mailing in the DAI-mailing list, including also CFP for DAI
conferences, book reviews, and similiar stuff, see below)

I have received more than 20 responses with enough hints to keep me working
for some time. I fetched several kilograms of paper in our library last
week.  Thanks to everybody who contributed. Those who offered me further
information may get some specific questions later, when I read some of the
recomended stuff.

Please don't feel insulted, if you are not mentioned in this posting, or if
the provided information is not correct.

I'm sorry, this took so long. Unfortunately other things are begging to be
done.

To those of you who were interested in my own work in this area, I have to
tell you, there is none (not yet?). That's why I wanted to find out, what
has been done so far.

Louis

                           =========================
This reflects only answers I got by email, I haven't checked out the facts.
It is not meant to be complete.

Question:

>I'm looking for research work on distributed AI. Does anyone knows about
>work done in the following areas:
>
>1. Interoperating of multiple (possibly heterogeneous) expert systems.
>
>2. Dealing with inconsistencies among different expert systems, if theyare
>connected together to give one advice.
>
>Imagine 10surgeon-expert-systems discussing the best way to fix a broken leg.
>
>Anyhints are welcome (other newsgroup to post, papers, conferences, books,
>email addresses of authors, ...)
>
>Please answer via email. I will forward/repost a summary if requested.

PLEASE DON'T FLOOD THEIR MAILBOXES. They will probably never
talk to me again if you do that. I'm sure that they are willing to help
you, if you have specific questions.

-The University of Massachusetts seems to focus research in this topic. I
 got a couple of answers from people studying and working there. They
 research on DAI, Blackboard Systems, multiagent conflict negotiation.  You
 could contact
