Summary:      ICOT Free Software

Description:

   This directory contains free AI-related software from Japan's
   Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT). The
   collection includes a variety of prolog-based programs in symbol
   processing, knowledge representation, reasoning and problem solving,
   natural language processing.
   
   General information on the software can be obtained in the files
   archived in info.tgz. This includes documents on copyright and
   conditions for use, Japanese Kanji code, KLIC (KL1 language processor
   on UNIX), and Common-ESP (ESP language processor on UNIX). 
   
   Programs are written in KL1 (Parallel logic programming language on
   Parallel Inference Machine), C, Prolog, ESP (Sequential Logic
   programming language on PSI), Common-ESP (ESP on UNIX machine).
   Note that most of the programs are written for the PSI machines,
   and very few have been ported to Unix-based emulators.  
   
   See the index.txt file for an index to the contents of this directory.
