Summary:      Symbolic Calculator with Learning

Version:      3.1a

Description: 

   SymbMath (Symbolic Mathematics) is a computer algebra system that can
   perform exact numeric, symbolic and graphic computation. 

   SymbMath can provide analytical and numeric answers for:

      -  Differentiation: regular or higher order, partial or total,
         mixed and implicit differentiation, one-sided derivatives.

      -  Integration: indefinite or definite integration, multiple
         integration, infinity as a bound, parametric or iterated 
         integration, line or surface integrals, discontinuous or 
         implicit integration.

      -  Solution of equations: roots of a polynomial, systems of
         algebraic or differential equations.

      -  Manipulation of expressions: simplification, factoring or 
         expansion, substitution, evaluation.

      -  Calculation: exact and floating-point numeric computation
         of integer, rational, real and complex numbers in the range 
         from minus to plus infinity, even with different units.

      -  Limits: real, complex or one-sided limits, indeterminate forms.

      -  Complex: calculation, functions, derivatives, integration.

      -  Sum and product: partial, finite or infinite.

      -  Others: series, lists, arrays, vectors, matrices, tables, etc.

   Also included are:

      -  Plot: functions, polar, parametric, data, and list.

      -  Draw: lines, arcs, ellipse, circles, ovals.

      -  Auto-loaded library in the source code.

      -  Pull-down and pop-up menus, resizable and colorable windows.

      -  On-line help, and on-line manual.

      -  Procedural, conditional, iterational, recursive, functional,
         rule-based, logic, pattern-matching and graphic programming.

      -  Database searching.
