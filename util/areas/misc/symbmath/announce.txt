    SymbMath (an abbreviation for Symbolic Mathematics) is a symbolic 
calculator that can solve symbolic math problems. 
    SymbMath is a computer algebra system that can perform exact 
numeric, symbolic and graphic computation. It manipulates complicated
formulas and returns answers in terms of symbols, formulas, exact
numbers, table and graph. 
    SymbMath is an expert system that is able to learn from user's input. 
If the user only input one formula without writing any code, it will 
automatically learn many problems related to this formula (e.g. it learns 
many integrals involving an unknown function f(x) from one derivative 
f'(x) ).
    SymbMath is a symbolic, numeric and graphics computing environment 
where you can set up, run and document your calculation, draw your graph, 
and use external functions in the same way as standard functions since 
the external functions are auto-loaded.
    SymbMath is a programming language in which you can define conditional, 
case, piecewise, recursion, multi-value functions and procedures, 
derivatives, intergrals and rules.
    SymbMath is database where you can search your data.
    SymbMath is a multi-windowed editor in which you can copy-and-paste 
anywhere in a file and between files, even from the Help file.
    It runs on IBM PCs (8086) with 400 KB free memory under MS-DOS.
    It can provide analytical and numeric answers for:
	o Differentiation: regular or higher order, partial or total,
	  mixed and implicit differentiation, one-sided derivatives.
	o Integration: indefinite or definite integration, multiple
	  integration, infinity as a bound, parametric or iterated 
	  integration, line or surface integrals, discontinuous or 
	  implicit integration.
	o Solution of equations: roots of a polynomial, systems of
	  algebraic or differential equations.
	o Manipulation of expressions: simplification, factoring or 
	  expansion, substitution, evaluation.
	o Calculation: exact and floating-point numeric computation
	  of integer, rational, real and complex numbers in the range 
	  from minus to plus infinity, even with different units.
	o Limits: real, complex or one-sided limits, indeterminate forms.
	o Complex: calculation, functions, derivatives, integration.
	o Sum and product: partial, finite or infinite.
	o Others: series, lists, arrays, vectors, matrices, tables, etc.
    Also included are:
	o Plot: functions, polar, parametric, data, and list.
        o Draw: lines, arcs, ellipse, circles, ovals.
	o Auto-loaded library in the source code.
	o Pull-down and pop-up menus, resizable and colourable windows.
	o On-line help, and on-line manual.
	o Procedural, conditional, iterational, recursive, functional,
	  rule-based, logic, pattern-matching and graphic programming.
	o Searching database.
    Its three versions (Shareware, Student, and Advanced) are available 
from the author. The shareware version is available from anonymous FTP 
sites (e.g. oak.oakland.edu in /pub/msdos/calculat/sm31a.zip).

	<<IEEE Expert>> in August 1993, Vol. 8, No. 4, page 99, reviewed:
"SymbMath 2.2 is an expert system for solving symbolical math problems
and performing exact numeric computations. It can manipulate complicated
formulas and return answers in terms of symbols, formulas, and exact 
numbers. It also learns from users; for instance, it can learn the 
integrals of an unknown function from a derivatives of the function. The 
shareware version is available from Simtel20 archives on anonymous FTP
sites (rana.cc.deakin.oz.au as /huang/sm22a.zip) or by e-mail from 
listserv@vm1.nodak.edu or listserv@ndsum1.bitnet. Student and Advanced
versions are also available."
