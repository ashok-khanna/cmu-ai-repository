Description: 

   Common Lisp Music (CLM) is a software synthesis and signal
   processing package (CL-MUSIC) and a package that makes it relatively
   easy to take advantage of the Motorola DSP 56000 (CL-MUSIC-56).  

Requires:     CLM runs on NeXT under Allegro CL or KCL and on SGI Indigo
              under Allegro CL. Also requires C.

Ports:        The non-56000 version should run on any machine with C
              and Common Lisp.
