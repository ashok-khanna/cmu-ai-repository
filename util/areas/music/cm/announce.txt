Subject: new release of common music

I've placed a new release of Common Music (a music composition language in Common Lisp and CLOS) on  
ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu and ftp.zkm.de in the files pub/cm.tar.Z. The major additions are:

1) New CMN output syntax in Stella for postscript output via CMN. Chapter 12 "Manuscripting data using CMN"  
in stella-tutorial.rtf has documentation and examples.

2) New LAYOUT macro for organizing musical material. See chapter 13 "Describing musical layout" for  
documentation and examples.

3) Mutes and algorithm sprouting implemented. See section 7.10 "About Algorithms"  and new section 7.11  
"Creating structure dynamically" for documentation and examples.

4) Much work finishing/debugging Macintosh port of Stella, which should now function as well as the NeXT  
port, or better.

See the file changes.text for more information.
