Description: 

   The search class library is meant to be used as a tool for developing
   problem solving software.  The library offers the programmer a set of
   search algorithms that may be used to solve all kind of different
   problems. 

   The following search algorithms have been implemented:

      - depth-first tree and graph search.
      - breadth-first tree and graph search.
      - uniform-cost tree and graph search.
      - best-first search.
      - bidirectional depth-first tree and graph search.
      - bidirectional breadth-first tree and graph search.
      - AND/OR depth tree search.
      - AND/OR breadth tree search.
