<b>January 12, 2004 - <font color="red"> I am now actively updating the CVHP after a long time of being too busy to do the updates.  I am still busy and would dearly love assistance.  If you are interested in helping with the site, please let me know (vision+@cs.cmu.edu).</font></b> A big thanks goes out to Owen Carmichael who has been processing new additions to the site, and to Javed Rabbaini, who has been helping me clean up the broken links on the software sub-page.

<h2> Mission </h2>

The Computer Vision Homepage was established at Carnegie Mellon University in 1994 
to provide a central location for World Wide Web links relating to computer vision 
research.  Due to the success of the concept, we have broken the original monolithic
site into a number of specific subpages.  The emphasis of the Computer Vision Homepage
is on computer vision <i>research</i> rather than on commercial products.  
The growth and continued usefulness of the this site depends on submissions and 
suggestions from everyone in the computer vision community.  If you have 
suggestions for improvement, we would love to hear from 
you (vision+@cs.cmu.edu). <p>


<h2> The Maintainer </h2>

I have been maintaining the Computer Vision Homepage (on a volunteer basis)
since Mark Maimone handed over the responsibility to me almost two years
ago.  During my tenure, I have worked to improve the site in various ways -
from converting the data to a database to automating the submission
procedure to improving the graphics and organization.  Now I keep a <a
href="v-maintainer.html">log of my activities</a> so that you can see what
has changed.
- <i>Daniel Huber</i><p>

<h2> Search </h2>

You can either search just the <a href="vision-search.html">local CV
pages</a>, the local CV pages plus references (includes all pages within two
links of the local pages), or the entire <a
href="vision-search.html#Internet">Internet</a>.  The index is automatically
regenerated each week.
<p>

<h2> Other Vision Sites</h2>

If you don't find what you need here, try these vision-related sites:
<ul>
<li>ECVNet - 
The European Computer Vision Network has shut down as of February 1, 1999.
<li><a href="http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/">PEIPA</a> - The Pilot European
Image Processing Archive
<li><a href="http://www.vislist.com/">Vision List Digest</a>
</ul>
<p>


<h2> Text only version </h2>

We realize that not everyone is running the latest version of Netscape or Internet
Explorer.  However, we like to include some of the more recent capabilities of these
browsers in our web pages.  Since some of you may be using old browsers which cannot
handle these advanced features, we maintain a <a href="txtvision.html">
text only version</a> of the Computer
Vision Homepage which contains all of the information found on the regular pages.
These text only pages are also useful for access over low-bandwidth connections. <p>


<h2> Submissions and updates</h2>

If you are responsible for a site or know of a site that would be appropriate for 
the Computer Vision Homepage, please take a moment to <a href="submit.html">submit</a>
an entry using our forms interface.  If your browser doesn't support forms, or if you 
just want to update an entry, you can send your request via e-mail 
(vision+@cs.cmu.edu).  We still have to 
verify each entry that we receive, so it may be a few weeks before your submission
is processed.  We to notify the sender once we actually add the link. <p>

<h2> Very recent submissions </h2>

Entries that are submitted via the <a href="submit.html">forms interface</a>
can be accessed immediately
on the <a href="http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cgi-vision/unsorted.cgi">
Unfiled Submissions</a> page.  This page provides you with the most
up-to-date information possible, and avoids the delay that occurs between the
time that you submit a new entry and the time that the maintainer adds it to the 
correct sub-page.  Users of this page should be forewarned that these are
unmoderated entries.

<h2> New additions </h2>

We keep a separate log of the <a href="vnew.html">new additions</a>
to the Computer Vision Homepage sorted in chronological order.  The complete archives
of new additions can be accessed by season:<p>

<h2> Broken link policy </h2>

Occasionally, some links are unreachable for short periods of time.  Since the Computer 
Vision Homepage includes numerous links all over the world, you are bound to 
encounter broken links from time to time.  We periodically check for links that have
been unreachable for an extended period.  Rather than simply deleting these
links, we place them in a special page dedicated to 
<a href="v-broken.html">broken links</a>.  If you cannot find
a link in the regular sections, check the broken link page as a last resort.  If you
see a link on this page for which you are responsible, please e-mail the updated URL
to us (vision+@cs.cmu.edu).  Also, if you
find a link that has been moved, please notify us (our broken link detector does not
always identify pages that have moved). <p>
