You might try Boynton's Human Color Vision.  Of course the fact that I am
working on the second edition of this book has nothing to do with my
recommendation.

I understand via the rumor mill that Brian Wandell is working or may have
even finished what could be considered a replacement for Cornsweet's Visual
Perception.

I have used Levine and Sheffner's Fundamentals of Sensation and Perception
and really like it. It is about 3/4th's vision and the rest audition and the
minor senses.  It is primarily a sensory physiology book.

                           Sincerely,
                           Pete

Levine & Schefner's ""Fundamentals of Sensation & Perception" does a good
job (IMHO) covering psychophysics and general neurophysiology, -it does not,
however, address the computational slant. "Vision, Brain, Cooperative
Computation (Arbib & Hanson, Eds., I think it is 1987) is not a text, but a
collection of articles on computational vision, it might be worth looking
at.

Cornsweet's 'Visual Perception' is old (1970) but a classic and easy reading
too.  I recommend it at least for your students' reading list.  While a
student at Berkeley I used Horn's 'Robot Vision' for a computer vision
course.  It has since proved useful as reference for vector and matrix
operations.  I'm looking forward to the results of your project.

I recommend Bruce & Green's "Visual Perception: Physiology, Psychology,

psychology, and Gibsonian views, at an advanced undergraduate level that
would be appropriate for novice Psych grad students.

You might consider the book (I'm doing this from memory), The Neurobiology
of Visual Perception, edited by Werner & Spillman, and published I believe
in 1990. I may not be giving you the correct title, but the editors are
correct. The book covers a wide range of basic visual mechanisms, deals with
higher level problems such as illusory contours, motion, etc. The nice part
is it describes the phenomena psychophysically and also from a
neurophysiological standpoint. I use quite often for initial overviews. If
you want the full reference, let me know. Good luck.

I've taught undergraduate perception for years using Levine & Shefner, which
is probably the most difficult of the undergraduate texts, but is too easy
for graduate students.  Barlow & Mollon's The Senses is reasonable at a
graduate level but is getting to be a bit out of date.  There is a new book
by Roger Watt, but it doesn't seem aimed right either.  Brian Wandell is
writing a book that could be excellent, but isn't done yet.  I'm teaching
doctoral level perception in the fall for the first time and haven't decided
what I'm going to do either.  I assume I'll use various reading such as:

	Gulick:  Hearing
	Cornsweet
	LeGrand (for photometry stuff)
	Green&Swets, Bracewell, etc. (SDT, LST)

and greatest hits readings (Quick, Adelson/Bergen, Graham/Robson/etc., and
on and on).

As a student who came to vision from another field (engineering)...

I think David Marr's book is the best introduction to vision as a whole; it
presents both computational and psychological approaches to the problem.
You could have everyone read this book and then present the technical
details and recent developments for one area such as stereo or motion
perception.

I understand that their 3rd edition is just about available. The 2nd edition
is a very readable, scholarly, and up-to-date, and I have no reason to
suppose the 3rd edition will differ. The only problems for your course is
that is has chapters on non-vision senses, and not much on computational
approaches. Maybe you could find another text that covers that approach.
What I can tell you, however, is that your psychology students will hate the
computational part!

I guess I should say I have no financial stake in sales of the book!

At the risk of starting an academic flame war, Marr's Vision (1982) is very
good: he is well versed in the biology of the visual CNS, being a
physiologist by training, but is also adept at explaining thhe computational
way of thhinking thhat he helped pioneer.

Depending on how much time you allocated for that text, you could have
everyone read certain core chapters and perhaps have some students prepare
other chapters.

I don't know if your requirements for an undergraduate text are the same as
ours but I can give you some suggestions:

1. Goldstein Sensation and Perception 3rd Edition Wadsworth (1989).  A solid
introductory text that the students like. Has an unusual (and successful)
chapter on movement perception describing "5 ways to make a light move".

2. Levine & Shefner Sensation and Perception 2nd Edition Brooks/Cole (1991).
Strong on neurophysiological approaches, sinewave gratings and the like. A
shame it doesn't include anything on the computational side.

3. Sekuler & Blake Perception 2nd Edition McGraw-Hill (1990).  I ought to
like this book more than I do. The 2nd edition is printed on very thin paper
that makes it ghastly to read and the illustrations are dull. Also rather
too much on auditory, taste, smell, touch stuff. I am always suspicious of
vision people writing about other senses; they nearly always get it wrong.

4. Bruce & Green Visual Perception 2nd Edition Erlbaum (1990).  A bizarre
book that covers much of what you will want and then a great deal on ecology
that you probably won't. A bit shakey on the physiology, but much better on
Marr etc than most.

5. Zeki A vision of the brain Blackwell (1993).  Brand new though not a text
book.  A possibility for final year or graduate students.

Hope this helps

One book that would be ideal is "Theories of Visual Perception" by Ian
Gordon, published by John Wiley & Sons. The edition I've been reading is
1989, but there may be an updated version. It includes psycophysics
(Gestalt, Gibson) chpaters on neurobilogy (eg Hubel and Wiesel etc) and
computational theories (ie Marr etc).

Also, although it's probably not quite what your after, I've just finished
Zeki's new book ("A Vision of the Brain"). It really is a fascinating read,
and there are valuable lessons for the young contained in some of the
historical stuff about cortical localisation of different visual capacities.

Hope this helps.

Probably the best book would be David Marr's "Vision".

At a more basic level, I found Goldstein's "Sensation and Perception" very
useful when I first started in Vision.

Bruce and Green's "Visual Perception: Physiology, Psychology and Ecology"
has a lot of good stuff in it, although a bit too much Gibsonian material
for some people's taste.

For a very idiosyncratic treatment of the computational approach Roger
Watt's "Understanding Vision" would probably be worth looking at in parts.

There doesn't seem to be a good book on psychophysics per se. I wish someone
would write one!

The nicest book on neurobiology of vision I have come across is: "Visual
Perception: The Neurophysiological Foundations" edited by Spillmann and
Werner. Lots of good articles by many of the top people in the field. What I
found excellent about it was the way they link the psychophysical results to
the neurophysiology.

You seem to be teaching students from a wide variety of backgrounds -
perhaps you should use a wide variety of book?

Good luck!

I'd be interested to hear what replies you get.  I took a number of
perception courses as a Psychology undergraduate 1983-1986, I'd rather hope
that any reccommendations I might have would be out-of-date.

I guess David Marr's "Vision" is still very relevant. 

I'm currently working in the interpretation of medical images by computer.
"Computer and Robot Vision" by Haralick and Shapiro is a text in the field.
"Digital Picture Processing" by Rosenfeld and Kak is a little older. Both
are probably a bit daunting for those with no interest in maths.

I saw your post regarding vision books on comp.sci.image_processing.  A book
that I have used for such a course was: Martin D. Levine, "Vision in Man and
Machine", McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985.  It seems pretty good at both the
biological and computational topics.

A classic is Visual Perception by Tom Cornsweet, although it's somewhat
dated.  Brian Wandell at Stanford <brian@psych.stanford.edu> is writing one
that I think will be superb, but I don't know if it will be ready for this
fall.  I'd give you more suggestions, but I don't have access to my books
for the next couple of months (they're on a slow boat to Hong Kong).

I'm sure you will get LOTS of recommendations for intro books on vision.

I'd like to mention some lesser known and lesser used books, that you should
mention for extra reading.

1) A Taxonomy of Visual Processes, by Uttal.  Heavy on philosophical
   organization of the material, in a manner that I find useful.  Not to
   everyone's taste.

2) A Vision of the Brain, by S. Zeki.  Very recently published book on recent
   advances in understanding localization of brain functions, with a heavy
   emphasis on the history.  Again, not an introductory text at all, but an
   excellent addendum.

3) The Handbook of Perception and Human Performance, Volume I, ed. by Boff,
   Kaufman and Thomas.  This is an excellent high-level engineering-oriented
   presentation of (among other things) the visual system.  Important chapters
   include "The Eye as Optical Instrument", "Sensitivity to Light", "Color
   Appearance", "Colorimetry and Color Discrimination".

4) Eye, Brain, and Vision.  A 1987 Scientific American BOOK by David Hubel.
   This book is likely to be the most accessible to an introductory group.

Note: Books 2 & 4 are heavily oriented around neurophysiology, rather than
      psychology.  I don't really have a favorite text...I keep meaning to get
      around to writing it...but don't expect it for your course.

Good Luck.

There is a book edited by MS Landy and JA Movshon called "Computational

something better than this, would you let me know?

I am a graduate student in the experimental psychology program at the
Universityof Texas at Arlington whos major interest is visual perception.  I
suggest not using a book at all but rather using a collection of up to date
articles per each subject area.  We just had a class in visual perception
and the reading list was a scaled down version of my qualification exam
reading list.  Subtopicsinclude - spatial vision, fourier analysis,
psychophysics, physiology, visual search, visual attention, texture, pattern
perception, grouping etc.  I do not feel any one book is adequate (esp. at
the graduate level) but there are a few books with good chapters to be used
without having to read the whole book..

DeValois R.L. and DeValois, K.K. (1990). Spatial Vision. Oxford University
Press

Barlow, H.B. and Mollon, J.D. (1989). The Senses. Cabridge University Press.

IMHO books are good for introduction but a good selection of recent articles
makes the reading (and class) much more dynamic and tangible.....it seems to
make people understand that there *are* people like us out there doing this
stuff.....anyway if you would like i could send you articles by topic that
we have used if you are interested

oh wait how could I have been so blasphemous......they *must* read at least
the first two chapters of Marr's book Vision to me Marr's three levels
should be the foundation of any serious visual research (computation,
representation and algorithm, and implementation)

hope this helps...

Given that this is a graduate level course with interdisciplinary
participation, I'd recommend Marr's (1982) Vision book.  I think that it is
one of the few monographs around that presents a theoretical framework rich
enough for your psych, computing science, and neuroscience students to see
how they can be contributing to the same research problem.

You might try the following two books.  They both seem to cover visual
perception in a fairly broad manner:

Visual Perception - Physiology, Psychology and Ecology, by Vicki Bruce and
Patrick Green, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, London, 1985, ISBN 0-86377-013-4

Sensation and Perception, 2nd Ed., by E. Bruce Goldstein, Wadsworth
Publishing, 1984, ISBN 0-534-03035-1

I have no idea whether these are currently in print, but found them fairly
useful to cover issues of perception during my graduate studies in
Computational Vision.

Vicki Bruce & Patrick R. Green. (1990) Visual perception: Physiology,
psychology and ecology, 2nd ed. Hillsdale, Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.

This is a GREAT book that presents the basics of both the computational and
ecological approaches to visual perception and supports the logic behind
both with ample examples from comparative vision. I really love it and hope
to use it to push undergraduates a bit beyond what they think they're
capable of. I believe it bills itself as being for advanced undergraduates.
However, I've used it twice with students in a general experimental master's
program.  Only about 10% of them had ever had any perception before, and
many of those who hadn't thought it was too theoretical (they would have
preferred to look at a bunch of illusions and leave it at that, I think!!)
Good luck in your choices!

When I taught Sensation & Perception (upper division class, intro to sensory

around for a while, I used the 3rd ed.  The publisher is Wadsworth, Belmont
CA, ISBN 0-534-09672-7.

There is another book by Blake & Sekuler, but I didn't think the coverage is
quite as good.  It is more focussed on vision, while Goldstein covers all
the senses.

I'd check out the following two books.

Fundamentals of sensation and perception / Michael W. Levine, Jeremy M.
Shefner.

Visual perception : the neurophysiological foundations / edited by Lothar
Spillmann, John S. Werner. <1990>

The first reference is an excellent introduction to sensory psychology.  The
second one is aimed at a slightly higher level and focusses on vision.

For the Levine and Shefner book, check out the 2nd edition.

Hope this helps some. I've found these to be good references for teaching
and review.

From: "Mast  C.D.M." <rdm1@midway.uchicago.edu>

I would recommend Sekuler & Blake's _Perception_, but I'm biased.  (Randy
Blake works down the hall.)

Another good one is David Hubel's _From Eye To Brain_.  (I may be
remembering that title wrongly, not sure.)

It's got most of the basics, but it's from 1988, I believe, and contains a
bit of Hubel's personal opinions presented as facts, which they are not.  In
fact, a good deal of research since this book has come out (and, according
to some, a bit from before then) goes against some of the claims.  But, for
the most part, it's a simple and clear presentation of vision.  (If I
understand the criticisms of the book correctly, which I might not, the main
problem is that Hubel oversimplifies a few things.  Which, if I understand
computer vision folks, is probably the better direction in which to err.)

If this were a graduate level class, I would recommend _Introduction to
Visual Neurophysiology_, edited by Spillman & Werner.  But, this is more of
a research book than a textbook, in my opinion, though it is a good
refereence, and you may want to consult it or chapters in it for a class.

I hope this has been helpful,

_Visual Perception: Physiology, Psychology, and Ecology_ 2nd Ed. by Vicki
Bruce and Patrick R. Green.  an excellent text that is divided into three
sections, each describing the three different approaches to visual
perception.  it doesn't really get into physiology(only 72 pgs out of almost
400 pgs) - the emphasis is more or less on David Marr and J.J.Gibson.

E.Bruce Golstein's _Sensation and Perception_ 3rd ed. is pretty good, also.
 the emphasis is on physiological aspects of visual perception although it
touches upon different approaches as well.

Ken Nakayama and I like the Scientific American Readings in The Perceptual
World.  [The book's title is The Perceptual World, Editor is Irvin Rock and
the publisher is Scientific American.]  We did not like Bruce and Green when
we used it. I used to like Frisby's Seeing a lot for a graduate course but
it is getting a little long in the tooth.

I'm also looking for a good book on vision from the computational side.  The
only good one I've seen is by Marr, "Vision".  It's old, but has some good
info in there on texture analysis and edge discrimination, and is cited in
much of the vision literature.

In response to your recent query, I would recommend the text by 

Vicki Bruce & Patrick Green (1990) VISUAL PERCEPTION: Physiology,
Psychology, & Ecology, 2nd Ed. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.  ISBN
# 0-86377-146-7

This book is in a class of its own among perception texts, which generally
have much more glitz and far less theoretical depth. It is the only text I
know of that gives reasonably balanced and serious treatment of the three
leading (and contrasting) theoretical approaches to current research,
including Marr's computational approach.  It also includes an excellent
cross-section of the empirical literature, from psychophysics & neuroscience
to computational algorithms to animal behavior. The coverage is unusually
broad and sophisticated, yet conceptually accessible to motivated students.
The only thing lacking are the 'bells & whistles' that have become standard
fare of texts these days -- no cute sidebars or boxes, no chapter study
sections. There are plenty of illustrations, but there are no color plates
(that's the only feature I really miss).

Bruce & Green's book is more challenging than 'standard' texts like those by
Sekuler & Blake; Schiffman; Goldstein; etc., and it is much broader in
perspective than such classics as Gibson's and Marr's.  I have found it
doesn't fare so well with half-interested undergraduates [I suspect they
miss the glitz & resent the mind-stretching], but I would give it very
serious consideration for an entry level graduate course (or second-level
undergraduate course), most likely with a selection of supplementary items
from the primary literature.

Have fun!

From: Laurence Harris <HARRISL@VM1.YorkU.CA>

This might turn out to be an interesting survey! I have been looking for a
book on Perception (not just vision) for a very low-level class that I teach
as part of York University's excellent "everyone in the whole University
must do at least one Science course" policy. I just haven't been able to
find one at the right level. Gregory's Eye and Brain was close but is just
too out of date now.

Here are some comments:

Sekuler and Blake: This sounds like it will be a very strong competitor for
Perception         your particular needs. It has some holes eg. development
                   is pretty much left out and, curiously, given the authors,
                   motion perception is not very comprehensively covered.
                   But takes quite a neurobiological angle. Probably OK
                   for about a third year level course. Too long and
                   detailed as an intro in my opinion.

Goldstein:         Rather similar to S/B but without the holes and with
Sensation and      less detail and references. My choice (at the moment)
Perception         as the lowest-level Perception book on the market. But
                   still too much for the intro class - and too little for
                   a third year class.

Bruce and Green:   A very nice book indeed. Very comprehensive in its coverage
Visual Perception  of the main approaches to Perception. Rather poor
                   quality of production with pictures in boxes and a curious
                   difficulty in keeping the hard back edition open. Suitable
                   a fourth year class that had already done more Perception
                   than would be in a Pscyh 101 class. Or even for a graduate
                   class as an intro at that level.

I'll send along a few more reviews later.....

Hello!  I am not a pro in this field. However, I have read some material in
this area recently.  Here we go:

Vision by David Marr (Late of MIT).  W. H. Freeman and Company. 

To an extent ( a few chapters) of Digital Pictures: Representation and
compression by A. N. Netravali and B. G. Haskell (both with AT&T Bell Labs).
Plenum Press.

Handbook of sensory physiology v.7: Visual Psychophysics.  Springer-Verlag.

There may be many more better books out there.  Thought I would share some
of what I came across.  Good Luck.

Hi, Some suggestions for a text for the graduate level course in visual
perception:

o Visual Perception, edited by Spillman and Werner - broad but uneven
coverage; fairly contemporary

o Visual Processing by Roger Watt - strong on computation, narrow focus,
very rigorous

Let me know what others suggest, as I'm teaching such a course Spring 1994.

I don't know if these texts would be sufficient for the material which you
plan to cover, but I've found both of these to be extremely useful:

David Marr, VISION, ca. 1984, is a loosely-written monograph hastily put
together as the author was deteriorating (he died before the book was
complete) tells the story of vision for AI which was Marr's philosophy at
the time.  It served as a nice introduction for me.  I think it is
especially nice in that it attempts to play biology against practical
computational solutions for innovation.

Berthold K.P. Horn, Robot Vision, ca. 1988.  This excellent text forms the
basis of Horn's graduate course at MIT.  There is a heavy emphasis on
geometry and applied calculus of variations as Horn plows through the
continuous and discrete mathematics for understanding scenes, motion, etc.
The course is firmly on the side of computational vision for solving AI
problems, but might still be of use to psychologists..  The book may be
watered down in some places from the course material (which was rather dense
but exhuberant)... I don't well differentiate between my own lecture notes
and the text material.

It sounds to me like you might have in mind more of the type of material
which interests Steven Grossberg (?sp) at Boston University.  Perhaps he has
written a text or can give you personal advice.

Good luck,
Tim Davis

P.S.  I've gone a different direction myself; I'm a vision/AI/signal
processor turned to medical imaging, doing functional MRI of the brain,
trying to understand all I can about blood flow changes with neuronal
activation.  We can actually see brain areas activating in real time.
Therefore, my knowledge about vision texts is somewhat dated.  Good luck!

I suggest you have a look at "Understanding Vision" by Roger Watt. I can't
remember exactly the publishing house, but it won't be difficult to find it
out. I think that the book fits very well the requirements of your course.
A free software (running under unix) can be obtained directly from the
author.  The book has been used for advanced courses in psychology and MSc
courses in Neural Computation.

I have read your message. Below I have listed two books that I think will be
helpful for you. Both of them concern the Neural Nets ONLY and available in
US. I know other ones, but I am not sure they were translated into English.

The books I can recommend:

1. R. Hecht-Nielsen "Neurocomputing".  Excellent book to use as primary
guide to Neural Nets. The author - chief of the HNC firm.

2. D. Dayhoff "Neural Networks Architechtures".  May be useful as an
introductory reading. The author - Ph.D. in Neurobiology (Univ. of PA, but
I'm not sure).

3. J.A. Freeman, D.M. Skapura 'Neural Networks: algorithms, applications and
programming techniques'.

Cordially,
Dmitry.

Hi there.  I'd suggest using David Marr's _Vision_.  While it slightly
outdated as far as technology is concerned, it does attempt to unify
psychophysics, neurobiology, and computation.  There isn't any other book
that I know of that does a better job at combining all 3 approaches.

If you are looking for a more compuational approach to vision, try Berthold
Horn's _Robot Vision_.

This might seem a bit whacky but one of the most interesting books I have
found on visual perception is "The Joy of Drawing" by Bill Martin,
Watson-Guptill Publications, New York 1993. This book is about teaching art
students to understand how people interpret images. I am doing work on
extracting 3D models from images and I have gotten several insights from
this book. Generally I find that artists know a lot about image
understanding, they just don't realize that thats what they are doing!
