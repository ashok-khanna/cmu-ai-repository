Crossword v. 1.0

Crossword allows you to create blank crossword puzzle frames and then have the computer fill them with words from a chosen dictionary.  You can watch the computer while it works, even interrupting it and stepping one letter at a time to better understand what it's doing.

The program is intended to provide a testing ground for different search algorithms.  It acts as a visual tool to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a particular method.  Doubtless it can find excellent use in an introductory artificial intelligence course.  With a little work and proper understanding of the code, one can add new search algorithms to the program.

This code may be freely distributed and modified in accordance with the usual terms of the GNU public license.  Correspondence is welcome–please let me know if you find the program interesting or useful!
