I just uploaded the Shamkovich Benchmark to the pub/chess/uploads/Unix
directory at chess.uoknor.edu as the file "Shamko.txt".  (I expect it
to show up in the pub/chess/Unix directory after being checked.)  This
file is the ASCII version of a typical chess article and it is
intended as a sample test for those interested in the construction of
NL (natural language) parsers with the goal of the automated
extraction of chess data.

A parser capable of the most limited useful understanding of the text
will be able to reproduce the game score; the solution text is given
in the document in a separate section.  A truly useful parser will
also be able to reproduce the side variations along with their
corresponding textual evaluations.

Sad to say, I have no more time at the moment to work on this.  I ask
that the first person to write a useful article parser, as tested by
the benchmark, please report their feat to the rec.games.chess
newsgroup readership.

It's a tough problem.  Do not attempt it unless you have plenty of
time available.
