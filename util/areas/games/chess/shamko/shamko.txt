Shamko.txt: The Shamkovich Benchmark for NL parsing and chess data extraction

Revised: 1994.02.22

By Steven J. Edwards  (sje@world.std.com)

This document contains the text of the Shamkovich Benchmark.  This benchmark is
intended for use by NL (natural language) parsing researchers and others
interested in the automated extraction of chess data from text articles.  The
article used for the benchmark is taken from page 27 of the 1994.02 issue of
_Chess Life_ published by the USCF (United States Chess Federation).  The
author of the article is International Grandmaster Leonid Shamkovich.  The text
has been selected as an example of a typical English language article with
expert level annotation of a chess game.

The magazine is copyrighted; this data is reproduced under the Fair Use clause
of the United States Copyright Law that allows a limited exception for
"scientific, literary, or educational" usage.  This is important to note this
condition as the annotation (i.e., commentary) portion of an annotated chess
game is in general not redistributable without prior arrangements.  The sole
purpose of this document is to provide a standard, commonly available text for
NL researchers.  The goal is to parse, via a program, as much of the article as
possible and to demonstate the completeness of the parse by comparing it to the
goal text that gives the actual chess moves in a simple, clear format.  A truly
useful parsing algorithm will also be able to structure the annotation in a
machine readable format as well.

There are two parts to the benchmark.  The first part is the article and the
second part is the goal text.

The article is taken directly from the printed version with all annotative text
preserved, but with diagrams and diagram captions removed; these do not carry
any additional semantic information.  The editor's introductory comments are
also removed.  Bold and italic typeface attributes have been folded into
regular text as would be the case if the paper copy were processed by a
mechanical scanner of moderate ability.  Letter case is preserved as is the use
of punctuation that is traditional to chess articles.  Two leading spaces on a
text line indicate the start of a paragraph.  Line breaks are reproduced as
they appear in the original.  There are no blank lines.

The goal text is the chess game reproduced using PGN (Portable Game Notation),
a non-proprietary standard for representation of chess game data using ASCII
characters.  PGN games can be read and written directly by a variety of chess
software.  More information about PGN and related notation standards can be
found in the file pub/chess/PGN/Standard at the chess.uoknor.edu ftp site.

  "What is this move?"
asked my opponent, the
famous Estonian theore-
tician, after the game.  "I
have never seen it."  Well,
it was just a successful
improvisation -- a theoretical novelty.
  12. e5
  After the game I found another attractive try, 12.
Bxf6!?, with the forced variation 12. ... Bxf6 13. e5
Bh4+ 14. g3 Rb8 15. gxh4 Bb7; and as I pointed out
in later comments to this game, "After 16. Qf1 (or
16. Ne4 dxe5 with advantage) 16. ... Bxh1 17. Qxh1
Qxh4+ apparently favors Black." *
  This line appeared, with some transposition, in
the 12th game of the Kasparov-Short match.  The
Briton maintained the balance after 16. Ne4 dxe5
17. Rg1! g6 18. Rd1 Bxe4 19. Qxe4 Qxh4+ 20. Ke2
Qxf4, but 20. ... exf4, keeping queens on the board,
seems to me to be more promising for Black.
Kasparov, as far as I know, has the same opinion.
  There is an interesting third alternative in the Ex-
change sacrifice: 16. Qg3!? Bxh1 17. O-O-O Bb7 18.
Rxd6 Qe7 with double-edged play.
  More solid is 12. a3 Bb7 13. O-O-O, but 13. ... Rc8
(not 13. ... a5? 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. Nxb5 a4 16. Rxd6,
which was quite good for White in Istratescu-
Buturin (Bucharest 1992 -- see Informant 54 for the
full game) gives Black equal chances.)  The text, 12.
e5, led to very sharp and instructive play.
  12. ... dxe5 13. fxe5?
  13. Qxa8 is good for
Black, but 13. Bxe5 is
not so clear.
  Here is an approx-
imate analysis of this
important line: 13. ...
Qb6! 14. Qxa8 Bb7 15.
Bd4! (the rescue action)
15. ... Qc6 (not 15. ...
Qc7 because of 16. Qa7 Nd7 17, Bd5!, winning) 16.
Qa7 Nd7 (White is a rook ahead, but 17. ... Ra8 is
threatened) 17. Bf2 (17. Be3? Bh4+! is very strong)
17. ... Nc5! 18. O-O-O Ra8, and now 19. Nd5 (or 19.
Bd5 Qc7! wins) 19. ... exd5 20. Bxd5 Qf6, and White's
queen is lost ingloriously.
  13. ... Qxd4 14. exf6
  If 14. Qxa8 Qxe5+, and Black has excellent com-
pensation for the Exchange.
  14. ... Bc5! 15. fxg7
  The rook is still immune, as 15. Qxa8? Qf2+ 16.
Kd1 Be3! wins right away.
  15. ... Rd8! 16. Rd1 Qe5+ 17. Qe4 Rxd1+ 18.
Kxd1 Qxe4 19. Nxe4 Be7
  Black has a clear plus, based on the strong bishop
pair.
  20. Nd2?
  The wrong maneuver.  Correct is 20. Re1 Bb7 21.
c3, which only slightly favors Black.
  20. ... Bb7 21. Nf3 a5! 22. a4?
  Preventing the threat 22. ... a4, but allowing a
blockade of the queenside.  However, 22. a3 a4 23.
Ba2 b4! as well as 22. c3 a4 23. Bc2 a3! also favors
Black.
  22. ... Rd8+ 23. Kc1 b4 24. Rd1
  24. Bc4 doesn't help
because of 24. ... Bd6!
  24. ... Rxd1+ 25.
Kxd1 Bf6 26. Kc1 (dia-
gram) 26. ... Bc6!.
  Paralyzing White's
bishop.  The game is
won.
  27. Kd2
  A desparate attempt to
win the a5-pawn with a king march.  Another try
is 27. Ne1, but it can be met by 27. ... Kxg7 28. g3
Bd4 29. Nd3 e5! with a won game for Black.  The
passed e-pawn will play a decisive role in the finish.
  27. ... Bxb2 28. Kd3 Bxg7 29. Kc4 Bc3! 30. Kc5
Be4 31. Nd4
  After 31. Kb5 e5, Black's a-pawn is "poisoned"
because of 32. Kxa5 Bxc2! 33. Bxc2 b3+, winning.
  31. ... Bxg2 32. Nc6 Bxc6 33. Kxc6
Now the opposite-colored bishops cannot rescue
White, as the passed e- and f-pawns are too strong.
  33. ... e5 34. Kb5 e4 35. Kxa5 e3, White
resigns.
  In view of the winning idea, 36. Bc4 b3+
