Summary:      Implemented Standards for Chess Move Notation

Version:      17-MAY-94

Description: 

   The SAN Kit is a freeware ANSI C source programming toolkit for chess
   software authors and researchers.  It consists of some twelve thousand
   lines of portable code that includes everything needed to write a
   chess-playing program except a search function and an evaluation
   function.  A set of public, portable standards for move notation
   (SAN), position notation (FEN), and game notation are described and
   implemented.

   Example applications include chess-playing programs, chess opening book
   repository software, chess game database software, and automated
   distributed computer chess competition.
