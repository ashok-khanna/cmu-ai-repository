Summary: I'll *DO* it!

Well, after several false-starts I've decided to go ahead with it.  I'm not
claiming to be the highest authority on amateur robotics, but I'm willing
to coordinate, edit, and make available a new electronic journal...

	PERSONAL ROBOTICS	(Copyright 1993, Rick Miller)

PERSONAL ROBOTICS is a cooperative publication for the advancement
of robotic technologies on the home front, so to speak.  There are
so many parts available, there's so much fun to be had!  Anyone can
get their feet wet in robotics...  even without government funding.

PERSONAL ROBOTICS is for those who want to have some "hands-on" fun
with robotics.  Articles will be mostly practical, and targeted at
the home robotics hobbiest.  Emphasis will be on where you can get
inexpensive parts, how the sub-assemblies work, and nifty projects
you can build yourself.  We'll see where it goes from there!  There
should be something for the newbie, and for the `old hand' as well.

PERSONAL ROBOTICS is an amateur effort, to be published as often as
is reasonably possible (given enough material) in electronic form.
Perhaps at some later date it will be available in hard-copy also.
It will be produced in DVI and PostScript formats for anonymous ftp.

Rather than mailing out the entire publication to eveyone interested,
a notice will be sent when each new issue is ready for file transfer.  
To get yourself onto the notice mailing-list, e-mail the publisher
rick@ee.uwm.edu (Rick Miller) and ask nicely.  It's not automated,
so be polite and don't send empty "Subject: SUBCRIBE" messages.

Letters, requests, suggestions and submissions are *very* welcome,
and should be sent to the publisher, rick@ee.uwm.edu (Rick Miller).
Please feel free to request or suggest anything you'd like to see
in PERSONAL ROBOTICS.  Lots of other folks may want to see it too!

Original work only, please.  PERSONAL ROBOTICS reserves the right
to select and/or edit all submissions.  Final copy will be Copyright
Rick Miller under the terms of the GNU Copyleft, though due credit
will be given to original authors.  Submit illustrations in a common
format (GIF, JPEG, EPS, etc.), uuencoded and send separately please.

I'm not going to make any profit off of this, folks, but it's going to be
a load of fun and a great learning experience for me...   I'm SURE of it!

If any of you have ideas, suggestions, questions, or even something you'd
like to have published, JUST LET ME KNOW!

	...hoo-boy.  What have I gotten myself into now?
