Hello, and welcome to the new edition of the comp.ai.genetic FAQ, 
"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation".

There are quite a few differences between 2.4 and the previous version.
Most are or a minor nature: a few existing entries have been tidied up,
and a number of small additions have been made, including five new
software packages.  Details of this and other changes are given below.

The next edition is due out on March 20th, 1995. Every second monday,
a reminder is posted telling people how to pick up copies by FTP,
etc.

As always, if you have information which could usefully go into the
guide, send it to me. If you find any information is inaccurate, please
let me know (if possible, with the _accurate_ information). All
contributions/help welcome.

If you have any questions which you'd like to be answered in the FAQ,
post them to the newsgroup first. If any sensible answers are
forthcoming, I'll include the information in the FAQ.

The FAQ comes in 6 parts, with the following broad categories:

	1. Intro to the FAQ and the newsgroup		22k
	2. Descriptions of different types of EAs	51k
	3. Practice and theory				40k
	4. References and information sources		65k
