Summary: This monthly addendum summarizes the changes made to the FAQ of
     the previous month; and also gives some pointers to future topics.

G'day folks,

as usual the FAQ comes with this little appendix, listing all the changes
made to the previous month's posting.

   The PostScript version on "lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de" is
available as "/pub/EA/docs/hhgtec-1.09.ps.gz"; or given you're in
the US try "ftp.santafe.edu" and fetch "/pub/EC/FAQ/hhgtec-1.09.gs.gz".

[NB: Some more infos on this new resource location hosted by the
 Santa Fe Institute will be announced soon; watch the News (cf below).]

This FAQ has become really a "bozo thingie", and thus will probably
not fit through all News spool gateways; a major re-organisation and
breakdown into smaller pieces is scheduled for '94; when time allows.
(It then will probably feature 6, instead of the current 3 parts.)

Anyway, if you don't see the 3 parts poping up at your site, order
them via e-mail request to <mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu>, from part2
of the FAQ:

[..]
  Here is an example of how to send for a document on  the  archive  at
  rtfm.mit.edu.  This example will return a list of all the FAQs stored
  in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers/, and a copy of this  guide.
  Send the message:

       send usenet/news.answers/index
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part1
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part2
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part3
       quit
[..]

Or consider browsing the PostScript version.


CORRECTIONS
  * the glitches incorporated by automatical glossarization have
    been fixed, esp. in the pseudo code sections.

ADDITIONS
  * pointer to forthcoming GA software survey paper
    in IEEE Computer (februray/94)			(cf A20)
  * EvoFrame/REALizer first commercial ES package	(cf A20.2)
  * Dan Abell added much to the Gray code section	(cf A21)

  * most were updates...

UPDATES
  * Tierra infos corrected courtesy by Tom Ray		(cf A4.1)
  * PGA new version					(cf A20.1)
  * EM entry enlarged					(cf A20.1)
  * MANY news on GAME (get a free version...)		(cf A20.2)
  * XpertRule/GenAsys entry completed (thanks Vicky!)	(cf A20.2)

  * Whole software survey has been alphabetised
  * Extensively cleaned-up tables of packages

DELETIONS
  * none (this time)

MISCELLANEOUS
  * credits have been updated, as usual			(cf ACKS)

FUTURE ISSUES (more volunteers?)
  * What's a Classifier System?
	[being written by -joke]
  * Where do I get test problems for my EA?
	(NETLIB, SoftLib, ORlib)
	[..]
  * What about the mathematical background of EA paradigms?
	[..]
  * What about PhD programs in EC?
	[..]
  * Do we need mutation AND crossover?
	(cf Spears in FOGA2, 221-237)
	[..]
  * An easy way to understand the schema theorem?
	(cf A99: ZEN NAVIGATION)
	[..]
  * Do we need "closer to nature" models in EC?
	[..]
  * Any problems with random number generators?
	[..]

  * The following terms yet need a definition for the Glossary:
1/5 SUCCESS RULE, ADAPTATION, ADAPTIVE SEARCH, AGENTS, BENCHMARK PROGRAMS,
BLACK MAGIC, CELL CYCLE, CHANCE, CHARLES DARWIN,
COMMA STRATEGY, CONVERGENCE VELOCITY, DECEPTION, EVOLUTION STRATEGY,
EXPECTANCY VALUE, FORGETTING, GAMETE, GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION (GD),
GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION, HARD SELECTION, INTERNAL MODEL, INTUITION,
LEARNING, LOG-NORMALLY, MACHINE LEARNING, MEIOSIS, MITOSIS,
NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, OBJECT VARIABLES, PHENOTYPE, PLUS STRATEGY,
PROBABILITY THEORY, PROBLEM DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE, REQUISITE VARIETY,
SELF-ADAPTATION, SIMULATION, SOFT SELECTION, STANDARD DEVIATION, STATISTICS,
STEPSIZES, STRATEGY VARIABLES, UNCERTAIN, UNIX, VECTOR OPTIMIZATION


THANKS
  Thanks to all those who immediately replied to the "$subject"; ie. the
  incorporation of an "image" of the FAQ into a book published by CRC Press,
  Boca Raton, FL; written by Lance Chambers, entitled:

	"The Applications Handbook of Genetic Algorithms."

  To Dan Abell for an extended Gray Coding contribution (well done!).
  Tom Ray for Tierra updates. Joachim Born for EM updates. Ms Una Smith for
  their help with the "Internet Services List."

  Last not least, James Rice, David Beasley, David Fogel, John Gregory,
  Rick Riolo, and Ron Goldthwaite for "mostly fascinating" discussions
  on this and that.

  Special thanks to Scott Yelich for providing me with an account
  at the Santa Fe Institute, and "trusting me" to set up an
  *Evolutionary Computation hierarchy* on the SFI's FTP server.

  [NB: more infos will be made avail. soon (1) via ftp to ftp.santafe.edu
   in the file /pub/EC/overview.ps.gz; (2) GA/EP/etc. digest(s), and/or
   (3) comp.ai.genetic; please do not try it now. It's useless, for it
   hasn't been opened to the public, yet.]

  Again, this is to YOU, (and to all those opposed ;-)

Enjoy!

	-joke
