Subject: Q10: What introductory material on EAs is there?

     There  are  many  sources  of  introductory  material on evolutionary
     algorithms: background books  (see  Q10.1),  textbooks  (see  Q10.2),
     classical  works (see Q10.3), journal articles (see Q10.4), technical
     reports (see Q10.5), more advanced literature (see Q10.6), biological
     background reading (see Q10.7), bibliography collections (see Q10.8),
     videos (see Q10.9) and CD-ROMs (Q10.10).  Information on how  to  get
     dissertations is also given below (see Q10.11).

     Conference proceedings (see Q12) are also a good source of up-to-date
     (and sometimes introductory) material.

Subject: Q10.8: On-line bibliography collections?

 The Big One
     Jarmo Alander has  compiled  probably  the  biggest  EC  bibliography
     around.  It  has 2500 entries, and is available in postscript form by
     ftp from: garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/research/2500GArefs.ps.gz and also  from
     ENCORE  (see  Q15.3)  in  file  refs/2500GArefs.ps.gz Please send any
     additions or corrections to <ja@cs.hut.fi>

     The same directory on ENCORE also contains  some  other  bibliography
     collections.

 Bibliography at Florida Atlantic University
     A  bibliography  of  over  400  entries  in  the area of Evolutionary
     Computation (GA/ES/EP/GP) is  available  (in  BibTeX  and  PostScript
     formats,       compressed)      by      anonymous      FTP      from:
     magenta.me.fau.edu:/pub/ep-list/bib/EC-ref.bib.Z and EC-ref.ps.Z

     Please     send     any     additions     and     corrections      to
     <nsaravan@cehps01.ce.ford.com> or <EP-List@magenta.me.fau.edu>.

 Combinations of GAs and NNs
     Dave Schaffer <ds1@philabs.Philips.Com> has compiled a bibliograpy on
     combinations of GAs and neural networks. About 150 entries, available
     in Bib format from ENCORE (See Q15.3) in file refs/cogann.bib.gz
     Jochen   Ruhland  <jochenr@neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de>  has  also
     compiled a bibliography on this topic. Some  papers  deal  only  with
     neural  networks,  some  only  with  genetic  algorithms.   About 300
     references altogether. Some include  an  abstract.   Available  from:
     ftp.neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de:/pub/NeuralNets/                in
     We_and_our_work/papers/diplom.1.bib.gz There are plans to expand this
     bibliography   from  time  to  time;  the  sequels  will  have  names
     diplom.2.bib.gz, etc.

 Bibliography at IlliGAL
     A bibliography on Genetic Algorithms compiled by David  E.  Goldberg,
     Kelsey  Milman,  and Christina Tidd is available as IlliGAL Report No
     92008        (see         Q14),         via         ftp         from:
     gal4.ge.uiuc.edu:/pub/papers/IlliGALs/92008part1.ps.Z             and
     92008part2.ps.Z

 GAPHD Bibliography Collection
     Martyn   Amos   <Martyn.Amos@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>   has   assembled   a
     collection  of  bibliographies  from  various  sources, tidied up the
     entries and removed duplicates. The collections are as follows:

	 Alife.bib.gz      - General Artificial Life
	 ICGA-93.bib.gz    - Proc. International Conference on GAs (1993)
	 chaos.bib.gz      - Chaos theory
	 ga+nn.bib.gz      - GAs and neural networks
	 ga.bib.gz         - General GA references
	 ga2.bib.gz        - General GA references
	 parallelGA.bib.gz - Parallel GAs
	 theory.bib.gz     - Theoretical computer science (bias towards graph
			   theory, stochasic modelling and pobability theory)
	 misc.bib.gz       - Miscellaneous topics (eg. Internet)

     There are about 6200 references in total, although the  biggest  file

Subject: Q11: What EC related journals and magazines are there?

     [eds  note:  comments  on  speed of reviewing and publishing, whether
     they accept LaTeX/TeX format or ASCII by e-mail, etc. are welcome]

 1. Dedicated EC Journals:
  Evolutionary Computation
     Published quarterly  by:  MIT  Press  Journals,  55  Hayward  Street,
     Cambridge,  MA  02142-1399,  USA.  Tel:  (617)  253-2889,  Fax: (617)
     258-6779, <journals-orders@mit.edu>

     Along with the explosive growth of the computing  industry  has  come
     the  need  to  design  systems  capable  of  functioning  in complex,
     changing ENVIRONMENTs.  Considerable effort is  underway  to  explore
     alternative  approaches  to  designing  more  robust computer systems
     capable of learning from and adapting to  the  environment  in  which
     they operate.

     One broad class of such techniques takes its inspiration from natural
     systems  with  particular  emphasis   on   evolutionary   models   of
     computation  such  as GAs, ESs.  CFS, and EP.  Until now, information
     on these techniques has been widely spread over numerous disciplines,
     conferences, and journals.  [eds note: The editorial board reads like
     a who-is-who in EC.]  For paper e-mail submission,  use  one  of  the
     following addresses:

     o  America:       John Grefenstette <gref@aic.nrl.navy.mil>

  BioSystems
     Journal  of  Biological and Information Processing Sciences, Elsevier
     Science  Publishers,  P.O.  Box  1527,   1000   BM   Amsterdam,   The
     Netherlands.

     BioSystems  encourages  experimental,  computational, and theoretical
     articles  that  link  biology,   evolutionary   thinking,   and   the
     information  processing  sciences.  The link areas form a circle that
     encompasses  the  fundamental  nature   of   biological   information
     processing,  computational  modeling  of  complex biological systems,
     evolutionary models of computation,  the  application  of  biological
     principles  to  the design of novel computing systems, and the use of
     biomolecular materials to synthesize artificial systems that  capture
     essential principles of natural biological information processing.

     Topics:  Molecular  EVOLUTION:  Self-organizing  and self-replicating
     systems, Origin and evolution of the  genetic  mechanism;  Biological
     Information  Processing:   Molecular  recognition,  Cellular control,
     Neuromuscular computing, Biological adaptability, Molecular computing
     technologies;    EVOLUTIONARY    SYSTEMS:   Stochastic   evolutionary
     algorithms, Evolutionary  OPTIMIZATION,  SIMULATION  of  genetic  and
     ecological  systems,  Applications  (neural  nets,  machine learning,
     robotics))

  Complex Systems
     Published by: Complex Systems  Publications,  Inc.,  P.O.  Box  6149,
     Champaign, IL 61821-8149, USA.
     Complex  Systems  devotes to the rapid publication of research on the
     science,  mathematics,  and  engineering  of  systems   with   simple
     components   but   complex   overall   behavior.   Try  finger(1)  on

  Machine Learning
     Published by:  Kluwer  Academic  Publishers,  P.O.  Box  358,  Accord
     Station, Hingham, MA 02018-0358 USA.

     Machine   Learning   is   an  international  forum  for  research  on
     computational approaches to learning. The journal publishes  articles
     reporting  substantive  research  results on a wide range of learning
     methods applied to a variety of task domains. The  ideal  paper  will
     make   a   theoretical   contribution   supported   by   a   computer
     implementation.

     The journal  has  published  many  key  papers  in  learning  theory,
     reinforcement  learning,  and  decision  tree  methods.   The journal
     regularly publishes special issues devoted to GAs and CFS as well.

  Adaptive Behavior
     Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.

     Broadly, behavior is adaptive if it deals successfully  with  changes
     circumstances.   For   example,   when   surprised,  a  hungry  --but
     environmentally informed-- mouse  may  dart  for  cover  rather  than
     another piece of cheese. Similarly, a tripped-up ROBOT [eds note: not
     necessarily built by Sirius Cybernetics Corp.]  could get back on its
     feet  and  accomplish a moonrock-finding mission if it had learned to
     cope with unanticipated lunar potholes.

     Adaptive Behavior thus takes an approach complementary to traditional
     AI.   Now basic abilities that allow animals to survive, or ROBOTs to
     perform their mission in unpredictable ENVIRONMENTs, will be  studied
     in preference to more elaborate and human-specific abilities.

     The  journal  also  aims  to  investigate  which  new  insights  into
     intelligence and cognition can be achieved by explicitly taking  into
     account  the  ENVIRONMENT  feedback  --mediated by behavior-- that an
     animal or  a  ROBOT  receives,  instead  of  studying  components  of
     intelligence in isolation.

     Topics:  INDIVIDUAL  and  Collective  Behavior.  Neural Correlates of
     Behavior. Perception  and  Motor  Control.  Motivation  and  Emotion.
     Action  SELECTION  and  Behavioral  Sequences. Internal World Models.
     Ontogeny, Learning, and EVOLUTION.  Characterization of ENVIRONMENTs.

  Artificial Life
     Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.

     Artificial  Life  is  intended  to  be  the  primary  forum  for  the
     dissemination of scientific and engineering research in the field  of
     ARTIFICIAL  LIFE.   It will report on synthetic biological work being
     carried out in any and all media,  from  the  familiar  "wetware"  of
     organic chemistry, through the inorganic "hardware" of mobile ROBOTs,
     all the way to the virtual "software" residing inside computers.

     Research topics ranging  from  the  fabrication  of  self-replicating
     molecules  to  the study of evolving POPULATIONs of computer programs
     will be included.

     There will also be occasional issues devoted to special topics,  such
     as  L-Systems,  GENETIC  ALGORITHMs, in-vitro EVOLUTION of molecules,
     artificial cells, computer viruses, and many social and philosophical
     issues arising from the attempt to synthesize life artificially.

     new approach to economics.  Following  the  tradition  of  Joseph  A.
     Schlumpeter,  it  is  designed  to focus on original research with an
     evolutionary conception of the economy.   The  journal  will  publish
     articles  with  strong  emphasis  on  dynamics,  changing  structures
     (including technologies, institutions, beliefs, imitation, etc.).  It
     favors  interdisciplinary  analysis  and  is  devoted to theoretical,
     methodological and applied work.

     Research  areas  include:  industrial  dynamics;  multi-sectoral  and
     cross-country   studies   of   productivity;   innovations   and  new
     technologies; dynamic competition and structural change in a national
     and  international  context;  causes  and  effects  of technological,
     political and social changes; cyclic processes in economic EVOLUTION;
     the  role of governments in a dynamic world; modeling complex dynamic
     economic systems; application of concepts, such as self-organization,
     bifurcation, and chaos theory to economics; evolutionary games.

 3. Pointers to upcoming Conferences:
  The Genetic Algorithm Digest
     Aka "GA-Digest" always starts with a "Calendar of GA-related Events,"
     i.e.   a list of upcoming conferences, covering the complete field of
     EAs. (cf Q15)

  The Artificial Life Digest
     Aka "Alife digest" always starts with a  "Calendar  of  Alife-related
     Events," that lists conferences, workshops, etc. (cf Q15)

  The Evolutionary Programming Digest
     Aka   "EP-digest"  doesn't  list  conferences  explicitly,  like  the
     previously mentioned ones, but carries most CFP's; that can be looked
     at   in   the   backissues   folder  as:  magenta.me.fau.edu:/pub/ep-
     list/digest/vX.YYY.Z (cf Q15)

Subject: Q13: What Evolutionary Computation Associations exist?

  ISGA: International Society on Genetic Algorithms
     The  ISGA  is  a  mostly  fascinating   society:  it  neither  has  a
     membership  fee  (which  makes  it  even  more  fascinating),  nor an
     address. However,  ISGA  meetings  usually  take  place  during  ICGA
     conferences,  in  so-called  business  meetings  (BMs). [eds note: So
     during a conference, ask for BMs, if you want to join; or be ready to
     dart out of the room if you don't...]

  EPS: Evolutionary Programming Society
     Membership is $40/year ($10/year for students with id) and also gives
     you a discounted registration at the annual conference. You can  also
     order EP proceedings ($30/members, $45/other) from EPS.

     Address: EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING Society, 9363 Towne Centre Dr., San
     Diego, CA 92121, Attn: Bill Porto, Treasurer.

     Information  about  using  Internet  is  available  from  a number of
     sources, many accesible on-line, via email or FTP.  For example,  the
     EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) publishes two guides for novices
     on all  the  Internet  has  to  offer,   by  Adam  Gaffin  and  Joerg
     Heitkoetter (see below). These are avaiable over the net.

     To receive a short guide to using anonymous FTP, send e-mail with the
     text "help" to <info@sunsite.unc.edu>.

     If you dont have FTP access, you can  retrieve  documents  using  the
     FTP-by-email  service.  The "ftpmail" service is installed on several
     sites to allow transmission of FTPable files from almost anywhere. To
     get  the  PostScript version of this FAQ from ENCORE, (See Q15.3) for
     example, send a message  to  (for  example)  <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com>
     containing the lines:
	       reply <your-own-e-mail-address-here>
	       connect alife.santafe.edu
	       get pub/USER-AREA/EC/FAQ/hhgtec.ps.gz
	       quit
     where <your-e-mail-address> is e.g. foo@bar.edu

     FTPmail  sites  available  are listed below. Use one that is near you
     for best performance.

	 (USA)     <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com>
		   <ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu>
		   <bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu>

	 (Europe)  <bitftp@dearn> or to <bitftp@vm.gmd.de>
		   <ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de>
		   <ftpmail@ftp.inf.tu-dresden.de>
		   <ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr>
		   <bitftp@plearn.edu.pl>
		   <ftpmail@doc.ic.ak.uk>

     Documents  from  the  archive  at  <rtfm.mit.edu>  can  be  retrieved
     similarly  by sending email to <mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu>, containing
     a message such as:

	  send usenet/news.answers/index
	  send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part1
	  quit
