Hello, and welcome to the new edition of the comp.ai.genetic FAQ, 
"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation".

There are quite a few differences between 2.3 and the previous
version.  Most notably, the survey of software packages available in
part 5 has been thoroughly revised. All authors of software packages
were consulted to ensure that the information contained in the guide is
still up to date.  Furthermore, five new software packages were added.
Details of this and other changes are given below.

The next edition is due out on December 20th. Every second monday,
a reminder is posted telling people how to pick up copies by FTP,
etc.

As always, if you have information which could usefully go into the
guide, send it to me. If you find any information is inaccurate, please
let me know (if possible, with the _accurate_ information). All
contributions/help welcome.

If you have any questions which you'd like to be answered in the FAQ,
post them to the newsgroup first. If any sensible answers are
forthcoming, I'll include the information in the FAQ.

The FAQ comes in 6 parts, with the following broad categories:

	1. Intro to the FAQ and the newsgroup		22k
	2. Descriptions of different types of EAs	50k
	3. Practice and theory				40k
	4. References and information sources		63k
	5. EA software packages				68k
	6. Other topics and glossary			60k
