G'day & G'bye folks!

This is the final issue of the FAQ in 1994, and the final one that's
edited by me.

   The FAQ contents has been tremendously stable over the last months, and
thus, the posting period will be reduced to 4 times per year.

However, the show must go on, so David Beasley will continue and edit the
next issue; I'll try to support him to make the transition as smooth as
possible.

   *You should expect issue 2.1 to come out on May 20th, 1994!*

   This December issue will also serve as the blue-print that gets
published by CRC Press, in Lance Chamber's "The Application Handbook of
Genetic Algorithms."

   My final weekend project and "new year's gift" to the EC community,
i.e., the "low-end" (student part) of it, has just opened its doors.
Enter SAFIER, the SAnta Fe Institute's Evolutionary computation Repository
via sfi.santafe.edu:/pub/EC, and get (1) the CONTENTS file, or even better:
(2) "The Navigator's Handbook to SAFIER", available as:

   sfi.santafe.edu:/pub/EC/handbook/safier.ps.gz	(A4 paper)
   sfi.santafe.edu:/pub/EC/handbook/safier-US.ps.gz	(US letter size)

Please note that this is a *draft*, although some 35 pages long.

   Another project is also avail. from SAFIER at present: Howard Gutowitz'
Cellular Automata FAQ, that I helped to bootstrap. It's under:

   sfi.santafe.edu:/pub/EC/CA/FAQ/

but this is subject to change during the next months.

   And finally: "Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet" edition 1.04 is out;
get it from the European or US default locations:

   ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/books/big-dummys-guide/big-dummys-guide-texi/
   ftp.eff.org:/pub/Net_info/Big_Dummy/big-dummys-guide-texi/

That's all folks! Bye, bye			-joke


	* HOW TO GET THE FAQ, WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS?

   The PostScript version on "lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de" is
available as "/pub/EA/docs/hhgtec-1.10.ps.gz"; or given you're in
the US from SAFIER, the SAnta Fe Institute's Evolutionary computation
Repository, try "ftp.santafe.edu" and fetch "/pub/EC/FAQ/hhgtec-1.10.gs.gz".

This FAQ has become really a "bozo thingie", and thus will probably
not fit through all News spool gateways; a major re-organisation and
breakdown into smaller pieces is scheduled for '94; when time allows.
(It then will probably feature 6, instead of the current 3 parts.)

Anyway, if you don't see the 3 parts poping up at your site, order
them via e-mail request to <mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu>, from part2
of the FAQ:

[..]
  Here is an example of how to send for a document on  the  archive  at
  rtfm.mit.edu.  This example will return a list of all the FAQs stored
  in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers/, and a copy of this  guide.
  Send the message:

       send usenet/news.answers/index
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part1
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part2
       send usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/genetic/part3
       quit
[..]

Or consider browsing the PostScript version.

THANKS
  To all those too numerous to mention here, esp. those who droppe a
  "Thanks for all the Fish!" message; I know I am not alone.

  "And all our yesterdays have lighted fools; the way to dusty death;
   out, out brief candle; life's but a walking shadow; a poor player;
   that struts and gets his hour upon the stage; and then is heared
   no more; it is a tale; told by an idiot, full of sound an fury,
   signifying nothing."

	--- Shakespeare, Macbeth
