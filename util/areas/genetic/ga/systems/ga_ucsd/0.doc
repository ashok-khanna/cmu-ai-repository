Name:         GAucsd

Summary:      Genetic Algorithm Software Package

Version:      1.4 (7-JUL-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains materials related to the GAucsd Genetic
   Algorithm software package.  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a class of
   computer algorithms for optimizing arbitrary functions via methods
   inspired by biological evolution. 

   GAucsd is based on GENESIS, but with numerous bug fixes and
   user-interface improvements.  Major additions include a wrapper that
   simplifies the writing of evaluation functions, a facility to
   distribute experiments over networks of machines, and Dynamic
   Parameter Encoding, a technique that improves GA performance in
   continuous search spaces by adaptively refining the representation of
   real-valued genes.

Requires:     C, Unix

Ports:        Should be easy to port to platforms with awk and make utilities.
