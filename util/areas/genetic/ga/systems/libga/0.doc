Name:         LibGA 

Summary:      Library of GA routines written in C.

Version:      1.00 (23-JUL-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains LibGA, a library of genetic algorithm routines
   written in C. It is simple and easy to use, with many knobs to turn.
   Both generational and steady state models supported.  Most GA
   parameters can be set or changed via configuration file, with no need
   to recompile.  Function pointers are used for the GENETIC OPERATORs,
   so they can easily be manipulated on the fly.  Several genetic
   operators are supplied and it is easy to add more.

Requires:     C

Ports:        Runs under Unix, DOS, NeXT and Amiga.
