GENEsYs:
-------

GENEsYs is a GENESIS-based GA implementation which includes extensions
and new features for experimental purposes, such as selection schemes
like linear ranking, Boltzmann, (mu, lambda)-selection, and general
extinctive selection variants, crossover operators like n-point and
uniform crossover as well as discrete and intermediate recombination.
Self-adaptation of mutation rates is also possible.

A set of objective functions is provided, including De Jong's functions,
complicated continuous functions, a TSP-problem, binary functions, and a
fractal function.  There are also additional data-monitoring facilities
such as recording average, variance and skew of object variables and mu-
tation rates, or creating bitmap-dumps of the population.

GENEsYs 1.0 is available via ftp from lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
(129.217.36.140).  Log on with user name "ftp" and give your full e-mail
address as password.  The file GENEsYs-1.0.tar.Z in directory pub/GA/src
contains the complete software distribution; the documentation alone
is available as GENEsYs-1.0-doc.tar.Z in the same location.
