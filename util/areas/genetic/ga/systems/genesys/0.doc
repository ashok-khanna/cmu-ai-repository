Summary:      Experimental GA based on GENESIS

Version:      1.0 (3-JUL-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains GENEsYs, a genetic algorithms implementation
   based on Grefenstette's GENESIS.  It includes extensions and new
   features for experimental purposes, such as different selection
   mechanisms (linear ranking, Boltzmann selection, mu-selection,
   lambda-selection), general extinctive selection variants, and extended
   recombination operators (m-point, uniform, discrete and intermediate
   recombination).  Self-adaptation of mutation rates is also possible.

   A set of objective functions is provided, including De Jong's functions,
   complicated continuous functions, a TSP-problem, binary functions, and a
   fractal function.  There are also additional data-monitoring facilities
   such as recording average, variance and skew of object variables and 
   mutation rates, or creating bitmap-dumps of the population.
