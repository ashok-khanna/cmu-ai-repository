Summary:      Parallel version of Grefenstette's GENESIS program

Version:      8-DEC-92

Description: 

   Paragenesis is a parallel version of Grefenstette's GENESIS program.
   It is intend to improve performance without changing the behavior of
   the genetic algorithm.

   Unlike the punctuated equilibria and local selection models
   PARAGENESIS doesn't modify the genetic algorithm to be more
   parallelizable as these modifications can drastically alter the
   behavior of the algorithm.  Instead each member is placed on a
   separate processor allowing initialization, evaluation and mutation to
   be completely parallel.  The costs of global control and communication
   in selection and crossover are present but minimized as much as
   possible.  In general PARAGENESIS on an 8k CM-200 seems to run 10-100
   times faster than GENESIS on a Sparc 2 and finds equivalent solutions.
   The solutions are not identical only because the parallel random
   number generator gives a different stream of numbers.

   PARAGENESIS includes all the features of serial GENESIS plus some
   additions.  The additions include the ability to collect timing
   statistics, probabilistic selection(as opposed to Baker's stochastic
   universal sampling), uniform crossover and local or neighborhood
   selection.  Anyone familiar with the serial implementation of GENESIS
   and C* should have little problem using PARAGENESIS.

Requires:     C*

Ports:        This version runs on the CM-200 (Connection Machine).
