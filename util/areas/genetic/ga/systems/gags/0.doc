Summary:      Genetic algorithm application generator and C++ class library

Version:      0.92 (23-AUG-94)

Description: 

   GAGS 0.92 (Genetic Algorithms from Granada, Spain) is a system designed
   to make it simpler to design a genetic algorithm. It consists of a C++
   class library for programming genetic algorithms. But from a user
   point of view, it is a genetic algorithm application generator. The
   application generator takes a fitness function written in C and
   surrounds with enough code to produce a complete program. It then
   compiles it and runs it for you.

   GAGS includes the following features:

      -  A "chromosome" hierarchy, with variable length chromosomes.

      -  Selection procedures include steady-state, tournament, and
         roulette-wheel. 

      -  Crossover is 2-point. Uniform crossover is also supported in
         the library, but the apps generator does not know about it.

      -  Mutation is bit-flip, with user-supplied frequency. Other
         operators, like gene duplication or elimination, and gene
         transposition, are also included in the library, but not in
         the apps generator. 

      -  Best fitness and individual are printed on STDOUT or to a file.

      -  Most GA parameters are inside a configuration file, so that 
         different operators and frequencies can be tested on a
         fitness function. Only the fitness function and the output
         options are fixed, once the program has been generated and
         compiled. 

      -  Fitness evaluation using training files.

      -  Graphics output through gnuplot.

   The application generator gags.pl is written in perl, so this language
   must also be installed before using GAGS.
