<H2>GAGS: Genetic algorithm application generator and C++ class

GAGS 0.92 (Genetic Algorithms from Granada, Spain) is a system designed
to make it simpler to design a genetic algorithm. It consists of a C++
class library for programming genetic algorithms. But from a user
point of view, it is a genetic algorithm application generator. The
application generator takes a fitness function written in C and
surrounds with enough code to produce a complete program. It then
compiles it and runs it for you.

GAGS includes the following features:

   -  A "chromosome" hierarchy, with variable length chromosomes.

   -  Selection procedures include steady-state, tournament, and
      roulette-wheel. 

   -  Crossover is 2-point. Uniform crossover is also supported in
      the library, but the apps generator does not know about it.

   -  Mutation is bit-flip, with user-supplied frequency. Other
      operators, like gene duplication or elimination, and gene
      transposition, are also included in the library, but not in
      the apps generator. 

   -  Best fitness and individual are printed on STDOUT or to a file.

   -  Most GA parameters are inside a configuration file, so that 
      different operators and frequencies can be tested on a
      fitness function. Only the fitness function and the output
      options are fixed, once the program has been generated and
      compiled. 

   -  Fitness evaluation using training files.

   -  Graphics output through gnuplot.

The application generator gags.pl is written in perl, so this language
must also be installed before using GAGS.
