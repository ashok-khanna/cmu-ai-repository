Name:         GAC

Summary:      Simple GA in C

Version:      9106.12

Description: 

   This directory contains GAC, a simple GA (conceptually based on
   Grefenstette's Genesis) written in C.

   Baker's SUS selection algorithm is employed, n-point crossover is
   maintained at 60%, and mutation is very low. Selection is based on
   proportional fitness. This GA uses generations.  It is also important
   to note that this GA maximizes.

   A note on crossover is in order. This version of GAC allows for
   n-point crossover, where n is less than the length of an individual
   (although there is no check for that). It is also possible to run
   uniform crossover (see discussion below).

   GAC will display run-time information as it executes.  GAC also has
   the ability to output this information into files. These statistics
   include best behavior, online/ offline measurements, convergence, and
   the number of reevaluations per generation. At this time the code is
   commented out. The user can simply remove a few comment symbols to use
   this facility. See run.c and geval.c for details.

   There is no ranking, adaptive operators, etc. We intend to explore
   these issues in future work.
