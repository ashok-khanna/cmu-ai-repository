Name:         GenET

Summary:      Domain-independent generic GA software package

Version:      1.00 (20-SEP-93)

Description: 

   GenET is a domain-independent GA package. All problem independent
   mechanisms have been implemented and can be used regardless of
   application domain.  It allows the fast development of applications.
   GenET is intended to become a depository of representations and
   operators and to be used as a tool for comparing different models and
   strategies.

   The algorithm provides many models and choices.  For example,
   population models include generational GA, steady-state, (n,m)-EP and
   (n,n+m)-EP models.  Choices include automatic adaptation of operator
   probabilities and a dynamic ranking mechanism.

   The two included examples illustrate how to implement problems with
   heterogeneous and homogeneous structures (with explicit rep/opers) and
   how to use the existing library (FP).
