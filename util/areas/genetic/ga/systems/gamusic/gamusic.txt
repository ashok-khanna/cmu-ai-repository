Thank you for trying GAMusic 1.0: The genetic algorithm melody evolver
for Windows.

INTRODUCTION

GAMusic is a user-friendly interactive demonstration of a simple genetic
algorithm (GA).  Here, the GA generates short melodies and the user
assigns the fitnesses.  The iterative stepping, mutation frequency and
recombination frequency are all controlled by the user.  Each series of
musical notes is represented in binary form in an array 128 elements in
length.  This allows a maximum of 30 notes per melody and provides a
solution space with approximately 3.4 * 10^38 possible melodies.

GAMusic 1.0 was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0 for 
Windows 3.1x.  This program should run fine on any system running 
Microsoft Windows 3.1x.  No special sound card is required.
