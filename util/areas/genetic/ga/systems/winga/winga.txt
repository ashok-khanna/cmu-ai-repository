Thank you for trying WinGA 1.0: A Simple Genetic Algorithm for Windows.

INTRODUCTION

WinGA is a user-friendly interactive demonstration of a simple genetic 
algorithm (GA).  The program allows the user to vary GA parameters and 
to analyze the performance of the GA.  Here, the GA optimizes the 
function f(x) = (x/c)^10.


WinGA 1.0 was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic for 
Windows 3.1x.  This program should run fine on any system running 
Microsoft Windows 3.1x, however, a 486 processor is recommended.
