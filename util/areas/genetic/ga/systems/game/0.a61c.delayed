Description: 

   This directory contains Genetic Algorithms Manipulation Environment
   (GAME).  GAME aims to demonstrate GA applications and build a suitable
   programming environment.  Currently in the early development stage,
   the programming environment will comprise a graphic interface (using
   X-Windows), a library of parameterized algorithms and applications, a
   specialized high level language based on C++, and compilers to various
   workstations and parallel machines.  GAME is being developed as part
   of the PAPAGENA project of the European Community's Esprit III
   initiative.
