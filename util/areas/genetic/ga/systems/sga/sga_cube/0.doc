Summary:      Goldberg's SGA modified for nCUBE 2 hypercube parallel computer

Version:      shar 6-NOV-92; tar 5-AUG-93, 2-MAR-94

Description: 

   SGA-Cube is a C-language translation of Goldberg's SGA code with
   modifications to allow execution on the nCUBE 2 Hypercube Parallel
   Computer.  When run on the nCUBE 2, SGA-Cube can take advantage of the
   hypercube architecture, and is scalable to any hypercube dimension.
   The hypercube implementation is modular, so that the algorithm for
   exploiting parallel processors can be easily modified.

   In addition to its parallel capabilities, SGA-Cube can be compiled on
   various serial computers via compile-time options. When compiled on a
   serial computer, SGA-Cube is essentially identical to SGA-C.  SGA-Cube
   is described in TCGA report No. 91005.
