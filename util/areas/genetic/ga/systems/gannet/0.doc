Summary:      Genetic Algorithm / Neural NETwork

Version:      0.91 (5-SEP-90, 8-SEP-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains GANNET (Genetic Algorithm / Neural NETwork). 
   GANNET allows one to evolve neural networks using genetic algorithms.
   GANNET evolves nets based upon three fitness functions: Input/Output
   Accuracy, Output 'Stability', and Network Size.  The evolved neural
   network presently has a binary input and binary output format, with
   neurodes that have either 2 or 4 inputs and weights ranging from -3 to
   +4.  GANNET only allows for 250 neurodes in a net.

   The distribution includes source code, a verifier program that
   verifies the best neural network generated, and some sample datasets.
