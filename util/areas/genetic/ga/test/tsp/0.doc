Summary:      Library of Traveling Salesman and Related Problem Instances

Version:      1.2 (1-AUG-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains TSPLIB, a library of instances of the
   traveling salesman problem. The following problem classes are
   included: 

      1. Symmetric traveling salesman problems (TSP)

      2. Asymmetric traveling salesman problems (ATSP)

      3. Capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRP)

   The library was established as a result of the CRPC workshop on the
   Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP '90). The initial library of eighty
   four (now 144) test problems was collected from a group of well-known
   international researchers working on solutions to the Traveling
   Salesman Problem.
