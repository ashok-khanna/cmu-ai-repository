Genetic Algorithm Software Survey - Overview
============================================

As part of the workshop on Software Support and Test Functions at the 4th
International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (ICGA) I began to solicit
and collect information about available GA software packages.  Having re-
ceived a surprising number of responses, I feel that the following is a
fairly comprehensive picture of what's out there at this time.  Additions
and corrections are of course welcome and may make it into future updates
of this file.

Many thanks to all the informants, including - but not limited to - the
authors/contacts listed below.  Special thanks to Jose Ribeiro Filho,
Cesare Alippi and Philip Treleaven, whose survey article "Genetic Algo-
rithm Programming Environments" (to appear) was an invaluable source of
information.  The descriptions of PC/Beagle, XpertRule GenAsys, Omega
and EnGENEer are adapted from that article with their kind permission.

Genetic Algorithm Software Survey - Descriptions
================================================

GAGA:
----

GAGA (GA for General Application) is a self-contained, re-entrant procedure
which is suitable for the minimisation of many "difficult" cost functions.
Originally written in Pascal by Ian Poole, it was rewritten in C by Jon
Crowcroft.  GAGA can be obtained by request from the author; given suffi-
cient interest it will be made available via anonymous ftp.

Splicer:
-------

Splicer is a genetic algorithm tool that can be used to solve search and
optimization problems, created by the Software Technology Branch (STB) of
the Information Systems Directorate at NASA/Johnson Space Center with
support from the MITRE Corporation.  Splicer was written in C on an Apple
Macintosh, then ported to Unix workstations running X11; it has a modular
architecture with well-defined interfaces between a GA kernel, represen-
tation libraries, fitness modules, and user interface libraries.

The representation libraries contain functions for defining, creating,
and decoding genetic strings, as well as multiple crossover and mutation
operators.  Libraries supporting binary strings and permutations are
provided, others can be created by the user.

Fitness modules are typically written by the user, although some sample
applications are provided.  The modules may contain a fitness function,
initial values for various control parameters, and a function which
graphically displays the best solutions.

Splicer provides event-driven graphic user interface libraries for the
Macintosh and the X11 window system (using the HP widget set); a menu-
driven ASCII interface is also available though not fully supported.
The extensive documentation includes a reference manual and a user's
manual; an architecture manual and the advanced programmer's manual
are currently being written.

An electronic bulletin board (300/1200/2400 baud, 8N1) with information
regarding Splicer can be reached at (713) 280-3896 or (713) 280-3892.
Splicer is available free to NASA and its contractors for use on government
projects by calling the STB Help Desk weekdays 9am-4pm CST at (713) 280-2233.
Government contractors should have their contract monitor call the STB Help
Desk; others may purchase Splicer for $221 (incl. documentation) from:

Evolution Machine:
-----------------

The "Evolution Machine" (EM) is a collection of evolutionary algorithms
(Genetic Algorithms and Evolution Strategies) within a common framework.
It runs on PCs under MS-DOS and includes extensive menu techniques.

EM is available by anonymous ftp from ftp-bionik.fb10.tu-berlin.de
(130.149.192.50) in the pub/software/Evolution-Machine directory,
which contains the ARJ 2.10 archive files em_tc.exe (EM for Turbo C),
em_tcp.exe (EM for Turbo C++) and em_man.exe (the manual).  If you
do not have ftp access, please send us either 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 MS-DOS
compatible disks; we will return them with the archive files (660 kB).

We welcome bug reports, comments and suggestions, but have only limited
manpower for providing help, patches and new releases.  We are making
EM available in order to encourage the experimental use of evolutionary
algorithms, and to get feedback as to its strengths and weaknesses.

Genie:
-----

Genie is a GA-based modelling/forecasting system that is used for
long-term planning. One can construct a model of an environment and then
view the forecasts of how that environment will evolve into the future. It
is then possible to alter the future picture of the environment so as to
construct a picture of a desired future (I will not enter into arguements
of who is or should be responsible for designing a desired or better
future). The GA is then employed to suggest changes to the existing
environment so as to cause the desired future to come about.

Genie is available free of charge via e-mail or on 3.5'' disk from:

GENOCOP, Genetic-2, Genetic-2N:
------------------------------

These three genetic optimization packages are available as compressed tar
files via anonymous ftp from unccsun.uncc.edu (152.15.10.88), directory
coe/evol.  They have been developed by Zbigniew Michalewicz and are
described in detail in his recent book "Genetic Algorithms + Data
Structures = Evolution Programs" (Springer Verlag, August 1992).

GENOCOP (GEnetic algorithm for Numerical Optimization for COnstrained
Problems) optimizes a function with any number of linear constraints
(equalities and inequalities).  Genetic-2 is an optimization package
for the linear transportation problem; Genetic-2N for the nonlinear one.

GA Workbench:
------------

A mouse-driven interactive GA demonstration program aimed at people wishing
to show GAs in action on simple function optimizations and to help newcomers
understand how GAs operate.  Features: problem functions drawn on screen
using mouse, run-time plots of GA population distribution, peak and average
fitness.  Useful population statistics displayed numerically, GA configura-
tion (population size, generation gap etc.) performed interactively with
mouse.  Requirements: MS-DOS PC, mouse, EGA/VGA display.

Available by ftp from the simtel20 archive (WSMR-SIMTEL20.Army.Mil) as
pd1:<msdos.neural-nets>gaw110.zip or free on 5.25'' disk by request from:

    Cambridge Consultants Ltd.
    The Science Park, Milton Road
    Cambridge  CB4 4DW
    United Kingdom


GAucsd:
------

GAucsd is a GENESIS-based GA package incorporating numerous bug fixes
and user interface improvements.  Major additions include a wrapper
that simplifies the writing of evaluation functions, a facility to
distribute experiments over networks of machines, and Dynamic Parameter
Encoding, a technique that improves GA performance in continuous search
spaces by adaptively refining the representation of real-valued genes.

GAucsd was written in C for Unix systems, but the central GA engine is
easily ported to other platforms.  The entire package can be ported to
systems where implementations of the Unix utilities "make", "awk" and
"sh" are available.

GAucsd can be obtained by anonymous ftp from cs.ucsd.edu (132.239.51.3),
file pub/GAucsd/GAucsd14.sh.Z, or via mail server - send an EMPTY message
with the subject line containing "send GAucsd source" to nici@cs.ucsd.edu.
Requests to be added to a mailing list for dissemination of GAucsd bug
reports, patches and updates should be directed to the same address.


WOLF:
----

This is a simulator for the G/SPLINES (genetic spline models) algorithm
which builds spline-based functional models of experimental data, using
crossover and mutation to evolve a population towards a better fit.  It
is derived from Friedman's MARS models. The original work was presented
at ICGA-4, and further results including additional basis function types
such as B-splines have been presented at the NIPS-91 meeting.

Available at no cost via anonymous FTP by contacting the author; runs
on SUN (and possibly any SYSV) UNIX box.  Macintosh version available
on floppy disk for a $20 fee.  Both versions can be redistributed for
noncommercial use.  Simulator includes executable and C source code;
a technical report (RIACS tech report 91.10) is also available.

GAC, GAL:
--------

For those of you interested in obtaining some free GA software, I'm
providing the packages I've been using for a few years. GAC is a GA
written in C. GAL is my Common Lisp version.  They are similar in spirit
to John Grefenstette's Genesis, but they don't have all the nice bells and
whistles. Both versions currently run on Sun workstations. If you have
something else, you might need to do a little modification.  [Alan Schultz
informs me that GAL is easily ported to the Mac - although his version is
no longer available.]

In the spirit of "freeware", I am willing to e-mail either version (or
both) to anyone who wants it. All I ask is that I be credited when it is
appropriate. Also, I would appreciate hearing about improvements! This
software is the property of the Department of the Navy.

The code will be in a "shar" format that will be easy to install. This
code is "as is", however.  There is a README and some documentation in the
code.  There is NO user's guide, though (nor am I planning on writing one
at this time). I am interested in hearing about bugs, but I may not get
around to fixing them for a while. Also, I will be unable to answer many
questions about the code, or about GAs in general. This is not due to a
lack of interest, but due to a lack of free time!

    Bill Spears


ESCaPaDE:
--------

ESCaPaDE is a sophisticated software environment to run experiments
with Evolutionary Algorithms, such as e.g. an Evolution Strategy.
Future versions of the software will provide a well-defined interface
to any kind of Evolutionary Algorithm, for instance Genetic Algorithms.
The main support for experimental work is provided by two internal
tables:
    (1) a table of objective functions and
    (2) a table of so-called data monitors,

which allow easy implementation of functions for monitoring all types
of information inside the Evolutionary Algorithm under experiment.

ESCaPaDE 1.2 comes with the KORR implementation of the Evolution
Strategy by H.-P. Schwefel which offers simple and correlated mutations.
KORR is provided as a FORTRAN 77 subroutine, and its cross-compiled
C version is used internally by ESCaPaDE.

ESCaPaDE 1.2 will be available by e-mail request in order to track the
spread of the software as this is its first public release.  An extended
version of the package was used for several investigations so far and
has proven to be very reliable.  The software and its documentation is
fully copyrighted although it may be freely used for scientific work;
it requires 5-6 MB of disk space.

In order to obtain ESCaPaDE via mail request, please send a message to

    iwan@ls11.informatik.uni-dortmund.de

The SUBJECT line should contain the request 'help' or 'get ESCaPaDE'.
(If the subject line does not match a predefined set of mail requests
the mail handler will NOT recognize your request!)

mGA1.0, SGA-C, SGA-Cube:
-----------------------
 
mGA1.0 is a Common Lisp implementation of a messy GA as described in
TCGA report No. 90004.  Messy GAs overcome the linkage problem of simple
genetic algorithms by combining variable-length strings, gene expression,
messy operators, and a nonhomogeneous phasing of evolutionary processing.
Results on a number of difficult deceptive test functions have been en-
couraging with the messy GA always finding global optima in a polynomial
number of function evaluations.

See TCGA reports 89003, 90005, 90006, and 91004 for more information on
messy GAs; they can be obtained from the address below.  Please note that
91004 is a dissertation and requires a pre-payment of $9.00 US ($12.00 US
to ship overseas) to offset the cost of copying, binding and shipping.

SGA-C is a C-language translation and extension of the original Pascal
SGA code presented in Goldberg's book "Genetic Algorithms in Search,
Optimization & Machine Learning" (Addison Wesley 1989).  It has some
additional features, but its operation is essentially the same as that
of the Pascal version.  SGA-C is described in TCGA report No. 91002,
which is included in the distribution as a PostScript file.

SGA-Cube is a C-language translation of Goldberg's SGA code with modi-
fications to allow execution on the nCUBE 2 Hypercube Parallel Computer.
When run on the nCUBE 2, SGA-Cube can take advantage of the hypercube
architecture, and is scalable to any hypercube dimension.  The hypercube
implementation is modular, so that the algorithm for exploiting parallel
processors can be easily modified.

In addition to its parallel capabilities, SGA-Cube can be compiled on
various serial computers via compile-time options.  In fact, when com-
piled on a serial computer, SGA-Cube is essentially identical to SGA-C.
SGA-Cube has been nominally tested on a Sun 4/70 workstation, a VAX Ul-
trix system, a Cray X-MP/24 running UNICOS 5.1, and the nCUBE 2.  It is
described in TCGA report No. 91005, which is included in the distribution
as a PostScript file.

Each of these programs is distributed in form of a Unix shar file,
available via e-mail or on various formatted media by request from:

SGA-C and SGA-Cube are also available in compressed tar form via anonymous
ftp from the GA-List archive server ftp.aic.nrl.navy.mil (192.26.18.56) in
the pub/galist/source-code/ga-source directory.

BUGS
----

BUGS (Better to Use Genetic Systems) is an interactive program for
demonstrating the Genetic Algorithm and is written in the spirit of
Richard Dawkins' celebrated Blind Watchmaker software.  The user can
play god (or `GA fitness function,' more accurately) and try to evolve
lifelike organisms (curves).  Playing with BUGS is an easy way to get
an understanding of how and why the GA works.  In addition to
demonstrating the basic genetic operators (selection, crossover, and
mutation), it allows users to easily see and understand phenomena such
as genetic drift and premature convergence.  BUGS is written in C and
runs under Suntools and X Windows.

BUGS was written by Joshua Smith at Williams College and is available
via anonymous ftp from santafe.edu, directory pub/misc/BUGS.  Note that
it is unsupported software, copyrighted but freely distributable.



PARAGENESIS:
-----------

I spent this past summer at the Naval Research Lab working with Ken
Dejong and John Grefenstette to implement John Grefenstette's GENESIS
on the CM-200 in C*.  The result, which I've been calling PARAGENESIS,
is an attempt to improve performance as much as possible without
changing the behavior of the genetic algorithm.  Unlike the punctuated
equilibria and local selection models PARAGENESIS doesn't modify the
genetic algorithm to be more parallelizable as these modifications can
drastically alter the behavior of the algorithm.  Instead each member
is placed on a seperate processor allowing initialization, evaluation
and mutation to be completely parallel.  The costs of global control
and communication in selection and crossover are present but minimized
as much as possible.  In general PARAGENESIS on an 8k CM-200 seems to
run 10-100 times faster than GENESIS on a Sparc 2 and finds equivalent
solutions.  The solutions are not identical only because the parallel
random number generator gives a different stream of numbers.

PARAGENESIS includes all the features of serial GENESIS plus some
additions.  The additions include the ability to collect timing
statistics, probabilistic selection(as opposed to Baker's stochastic
universal sampling), uniform crossover and local or neighborhood
selection.  Anyone familiar with the serial implementation of GENESIS
and C* should have little problem using PARAGENESIS.

PARAGENESIS is available via anonymous ftp from the GA-List archive at
ftp.aic.nrl.navy.mil (192.26.18.74).  The compressed and tar-ed code
is found in the file /pub/galist/src/ga/paragenesis.tar.Z.

DISCLAIMER: PARAGENESIS is fairly untested at this point and may contain
some bugs.  I will try to fix any reported bugs as my schedule and my
access to the CM allows.

Genitor:
-------

Genitor is a modular GA package containing examples for floating-point,
integer, and binary representations.  Its features include many sequencing
operators as well as subpopulation modelling.




OOGA, GENESIS:
-------------

OOGA (Object-Oriented GA) is a genetic algorithm designed for industrial use.
It includes examples accompanying the tutorial in the companion "Handbook
of Genetic Algorithms".  OOGA is designed such that each of the techniques
employed by a GA is an object that may be modified, displayed or replaced in
object-oriented fashion.  OOGA is especially well-suited for individuals
wishing to modify the basic GA techniques or tailor them to new domains.

The buyer of OOGA also receives GENESIS, a generational GA system written
by John Grefenstette.  As the first widely available GA program GENESIS has
been very influential in stimulating the use of GAs, and several other GA
packages are based on it.  This release sports an improved user interface.
OOGA and GENESIS are available together on 3.5'' or 5.25'' disk for $60
($52.50 inside North America) by order from:

    T.S.P.
    P.O. Box 991
    Melrose, MA 02176




GENEsYs:
-------

GENEsYs is a GENESIS-based GA implementation which includes extensions
and new features for experimental purposes, such as selection schemes
like linear ranking, Boltzmann, (mu, lambda)-selection, and general
extinctive selection variants, crossover operators like n-point and
uniform crossover as well as discrete and intermediate recombination.
Self-adaptation of mutation rates is also possible.

A set of objective functions is provided, including De Jong's functions,
complicated continuous functions, a TSP-problem, binary functions, and a
fractal function.  There are also additional data-monitoring facilities
such as recording average, variance and skew of object variables and mu-
tation rates, or creating bitmap-dumps of the population.

GENEsYs 1.0 is available via ftp from lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de
(129.217.36.140).  Log on with user name "ftp" and give your full e-mail
address as password.  The file GENEsYs-1.0.tar.Z in directory pub/GA/src
contains the complete software distribution; the documentation alone
is available as GENEsYs-1.0-doc.tar.Z in the same location.

EnGENEer
--------

Logica Cambridge Ltd. developed EnGENEer as an in-house Genetic Algorithm
environment to assist the development of GA applications on a wide range
of domains. The software was written in C and runs under Unix as part of a
consultancy and systems package. It supports both interactive (X-Windows)
and batch (command-line) modes of operation.

EnGENEer provides a number of flexible mechanisms which allow the
developer to rapidly bring the power of GAs to bear on new problem
domains.  Starting with the  Genetic Description Language, the developer
can describe, at high level, the structure of the ``genetic material''
used. The language supports discrete genes with user defined cardinality
and includes features such as multiple chromosomes models, multiple
species models and non-evolvable parsing symbols which can be used for
decoding complex genetic material.

The user also has available a descriptive high level language, the
Evolutionary Model Language. It allows the description of the GA type used
in terms of configurable options including:  population size, population
structure  and source, selection method, crossover and mutation type and
probability, inversion, dispersal method, and number of offspring per
generation.

Both the Genetic Description Language and the Evolutionary Model Language
are fully supported within the interactive interface (including on-line
help system) and can be defined either "on the fly" or loaded from audit
files which are automatically created during a GA run.

Monitoring of GA progress is provided via both graphical tools and
automatic storage of results (at user defined intervals). This allows the
user to restart EnGENEer from any point in a run, by loading both the
population at that time and the evolutionary model that was being used.

Connecting EnGENEer to different problem domains is achieved by specifying
the name of the program used to evaluate the problem specific fitness
function and constructing a simple parsing routine to interpret the
genetic material.  A library of standard interpretation routines are also
provided for commonly used representation schemes such as gray-coding,
permutations, etc.  The fitness evaluation can then be run as either a
slave process to the GA or via a standard handshaking routines. Better
still, it can be run on either the machine hosting the EnGENEer or on any
sequential or parallel hardware capable of connecting to a Unix machine.

XpertRule GenAsys
-----------------

XpertRule GenAsys is an expert system shell with embedded genetic
algorithms marketed by Attar Software. Targeted to solve scheduling and
design applications, this system combines the power of genetic algorithms
in evolving solutions with the power of rule-based programming in
analyzing the effectiveness of solutions. Rule-based programming can also
be used to generate the initial population for the genetic algorithm and
for post-optimization planning. Some examples of design and scheduling
problems which can be solved by this system include:  optimization of
design parameters in electronic and avionic industries, route optimization
in the distribution sector, production scheduling in manufacturing, etc.

PC/Beagle
---------

PC/Beagle is a rule-finder program for PCs which examines a database of
examples and uses machine-learning techniques to create a set of decision
rules for classifying those examples, thus turning data into knowledge.
The system contains six major components, one of which (HERB -- the
"Heuristic Evolutionary Rule Breeder") uses GA techniques to generate
rules by natural selection.

PC/Beagle is available to educational users for 69 pounds sterling.

GAME:
----

GAME (GA Manipulation Environment) aims to demonstrate GA applications
and build a suitable programming environment.  Currently in the early
development stage, the programming environment will comprise a graphic
interface (using X-Windows), a library of parameterized algorithms and
applications, a specialized high level language based on C++, and com-
pilers to various workstations and parallel machines.  GAME is being
developed as part of the PAPAGENA project of the European Community's
Esprit III initiative.

XYpe:
----

XYpe (The GA Engine) is a commercial GA application and development package
for the Apple Macintosh.  Its standard user interface allows you to design
chromosomes, set attributes of the genetic engine and graphically display
its progress.  The development package provides a set of Think C libraries
and include files for the design of new GA applications.  XYpe supports
adaptive operator weights and mixtures of alpha, binary, gray, ordering
and real number codings.

The price of $725 (in Massachusetts add 5% sales tax) plus $15 shipping
and handling includes technical support and three documentation manuals.
XYpe requires a Macintosh SE or newer with 2MB RAM running OS V6.0.4 or
greater, and Think C if using the development package.

Currently the GA engine is working; the user interface will be completed
on demand.  Interested parties should contact:
