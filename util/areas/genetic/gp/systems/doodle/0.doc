Summary:      Screen saver based on Genetic Programming

Version:      8-DEC-93

Description: 

   This directory contains the Doodle Garden Screen Saver. It uses 
   Genetic Programming to evolve new drawings ("doodles") from a basic
   set (screen). 

   A small computer program draws each doodle.  The screen saver mutates 
   (randomly changes) a doodle program, or crosses programs (attach part of 
   one to part of another) with interesting results.  When the screen saver 
   is activated, it automatically generates new doodles every few seconds 
   by mutating and crossing the doodles that make up the base screen.  By 
   selecting your favorite Doodle Garden Screen, you are exploring Genetic 
   Programming and a fascinating visual space.
