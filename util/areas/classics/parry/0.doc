Name:         PARRY

Summary:      Paranoia mental hospital patient.

Version:      

Description: 

   This is the original implementation of Parry, in MLISP (meta-lisp) for
   a PDP-10.  It will not work in Common Lisp and would require a
   significant amount of porting (parts are written in PDP-10 assembly code).

   [If anybody ports this to Common Lisp, please send a copy to the
   CMU AI Repository.] 

   Also included in this directory is a sample of some amusing
   dialogue between PARRY and ELIZA.
