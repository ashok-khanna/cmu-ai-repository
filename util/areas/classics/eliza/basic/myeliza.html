Welcome to ShadeTree BBS, the electronic bulletin board devoted to
beginner and amatuer AI (artificial intelligence) enthusiasts.

We have the following AI related file and discussion areas on the bbs:

            AREA 1  Telecommunications/Compression Programs
                 3  MAE (Management Action Expert System)
                 4  General Expert Systems
                 5  BrainMaker Neural Net
                 6  General Neural Net
                 7  PROLOG/LISP
                 8  Hypertext
                 9  Genetic Algorithms
                10  Machine Learning
                11  Natural Language Processing
                12  Miscellaneous AI Subjects and Programs

If the board sees enough acivity, we will convert to an exclusive line
available 24 hours a day and upgrade to 2400 baud.  As users, you can
help achieve this in two ways:

            *  Get involved in the discussion areas
            *  Upload any AI programs or applications
               that you have developed

Please do not be hesitant about getting involved in a discussion.  This
board is dedicated to BEGINNERS!!  We will be getting input from the
authors of some of the programs but mainly we are all here due to our
curiosity and a desire to learn.

We are also starting a newsletter aimed at the people who use this
board.  If you are interested, there is a subscription blank at the end
of this text file.  It will be published 6 times a year.  The general
format will be letters to the editor, various help columns, tutorial
columns on the different aspects of AI (such as neural nets, LISP,
expert systems, PROLOG, machine learning, etc.), book and product
reviews, file location listings for ShadeTree BBS, ability to order
disks via the mail instead of downloading, column on tips for using
ShadeTree BBS in particular and OPUS bulletin boards in general.
The first issue is due out in late February 1991.  The subscription
rate is $9.00 per year.  If you have an AI related product (low price,
high quality) that you wish to market as shareware or commercially,
please contact us for ad rates.

If you develope an application or a program that you would like to
market either as shareware or in a more traditional, commercial way, we
would appreciate hearing from you.  We are currently establishing a
marketing network for just such instances.

If you would like to submit an article, series of article or and idea
for a regular column, please contact us at the address below.  Article
submissions must be on a 360k DS,DD floppy disk in flat ASCII or they
may be uploaded directly to the bbs in a "compressed" format as long as
they were originally done in straight ASCII.

We hope to upgraded to 2400 baud by the end of January 1991 and to
include the OPUS AI echo.  We will also be scouring the other BBS and
shareware distribution houses all over the country for other AI related
programs.

Thank you for your support.
