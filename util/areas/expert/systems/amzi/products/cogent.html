Cogent Prolog Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------------------


Can I use Cogent Prolog to develop Windows interfaces?
------------------------------------------------------

Cogent Prolog comes with a Windows runtime and Windows interactive 
development enviroment (IDE) that allow you to run classic scrolling, 
text-based Prolog applications under Windows.

Cogent Prolog does not include a toolkit for implementing GUI 
interfaces.  Instead, it is designed to easily work with numerous other 
GUI development tools.  For example, many of our customers are using 
Visual Basic and Cogent Prolog to implement Prolog applications with 
Windows GUIs; others are using Visual C++, and Borland's development 
tools.  Cogent can just as easily become a part of an Access or 
PowerBuilder application.  Other customers use generic GUI tools, such 
as Menuet for implementing DOS GUIs.

The Logic Server API is the component of Cogent that makes it easy to 
integrate with other packages.  It provides complete access to a Prolog 
program from a host environment, and easy mapping between Prolog terms 
and the variables of the host language.  For example, under Visual Basic 
you might issue a Prolog query that produces a Prolog list.  You can 
easily map that Prolog list into a Windows list box control from which 
the user selects an item.  You can then incorporate that selected item 
into another Prolog query for further processing.  (A full Visual Basic 
example is available on our FTP site.)


Do I have to use DOS for Prolog development?
--------------------------------------------

No, Cogent Prolog comes with a full Windows interactive development 
environment (IDE).  It includes an editor, listener, debugger, compiler, 
and Prolog linker.  While these tools take full advantage of the Windows 
environment, the Prolog code is still classic Prolog running in the 
scrolling listener Window.

Cogent also includes a Windows runtime that runs normal Prolog programs 
in their own scrolling Window.  This does not include any GUI features, 
but lets you run any classic Prolog program directly under Windows.


But you still support DOS, don't you?
-------------------------------------

Our DOS version is particularly robust, running in a flat 32-bit address 
space and utilizing virtual memory with the FlashTek royalty-free DOS 
extender.  It too is fully embeddable and extendable using the Logic
Server API.  For example, all of the mouse and screen manipulation 
predicates that are part of the DOS product were implemented using the 
Logic Server API and are distributed with full source as well.

Because Cogent Prolog is both source and object code compatible across 
supported platforms, you can easily develop Prolog code under DOS that 
runs in a Windows enviroment, as well as the other way around.


What if I really want to use Prolog for manipulating a GUI?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Logic Server API makes it easy to extend the Prolog language with 
extra-logical predicates that can do anything C can do.  So, it is not 
difficult to give Prolog direct access to Windows SDK functions, or any 
other GUI library functions.  To do this, you implement custom 
extensions to Prolog that map Prolog predicates to SDK functions.  Those 
extended predicates can then be used in your Prolog programs.

This technology makes it possible to design any kind of interface 
between Prolog and a GUI that you can imagine.  You can, as one of our 
customers did, implement predicates for manipulating the widgets of a 
DOS GUI package, but allow for the basic design of the interface to be 
done using the vendor's GUI layout toolkit.  You can implement event-
driven message handlers in Prolog that respond to GUI events, you can 
provide detailed access to the GUI, or you can write high-level more 
generic predicates.  You can even create your own language for GUI 
design and manipulation.

Larger Prolog projects could have one individual responsible for the 
user-interface tools that are use directly by other Prolog programmers 
in the project.


Does Cogent Prolog support graphics? database? ...
--------------------------------------------------

Just as Cogent can be integrated with any GUI package through C code, it 
can be integrated with any other package, including database and 
graphics packages.


How does the API work?
----------------------

Cogent Prolog is fundamentally a compiled Prolog.  It consists of an 
engine, based on the Warren Abstract Machine, that runs compiled Prolog 
load modules.  (The Cogent listener, debugger and compiler are all 
Cogent Prolog applications running on that same runtime.)

The API is a library version of the Cogent engine, with over 50 
functions for manipulating Prolog programs.  So, to use it you link your 
code with the library and then issue various API function calls to load 
and manipulate Prolog programs, much the same way you integrate an 
application with a database server.

Static link library versions are distributed for the major C/C++ 
compilers for both DOS and Windows environments, and a dynamic link 
library (DLL) is included for access from Windows.  It is the DLL that 
is called from non-C/C++ programs, such as Visual Basic, Access and 
PowerBuilder.


Does this mean I can't use interpreted code with the API?
---------------------------------------------------------

When you load a compiled program through the API, you also load much of 
the Prolog listener, which can be used to then consult Prolog source and 
perform asserts and retracts just as you do from a classic Prolog 
listener.


What other platforms does Cogent support?
-----------------------------------------

Because the engine is written in ANSI C, Cogent is an extremely portable 
Prolog.  In addition to DOS & Windows on the PC, it currently runs on 
the DEC Alpha under OSF-1 (using full native 64-bit addressing so you 
can run truly monstrous Prolog programs) and OpenVMS.  Custom ports to 
other platforms are available as well.


Can I integrate Cogent Prolog with C++?
---------------------------------------

The Logic Server API comes with a C++ wrapper that encapsulates a Prolog 
engine and all its functions.  This makes it easy to derive classes from 
that wrapper that implement particular Prolog programs.  In this way, 
Prolog modules can be hidden within C++ objects that provide services to 
the rest of the application through member functions.


What are the differences between compiled and interpreted code?
---------------------------------------------------------------

On average, compiled code is 10 times faster than interpreted.  Compiled
programs can also take advantage of module support, which allows for 
'hidden' predicates within a module.  Finally, tail-recursive programs
will run much longer compiled as their stack and heap use is optimized.


Are there royalties?
--------------------

No.  The Interpreter-Only and Compiler & Interpreter-Only are single-
user systems.  The full Cogent Prolog system includes the royalty-free 
distributable libraries and runtimes.


What about for educators?
-------------------------

We offer quantity discounts starting at 2 copies for educational 
institutions.  We also have a special program for students purchasing 
Amzi! products for a particular class, and a site-license for the full 
Cogent Prolog system for PCs or DEC Alphas.
