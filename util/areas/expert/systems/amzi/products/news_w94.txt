Announcing Cogent Prolog 3.0 for Windows and DOS
------------------------------------------------

Cogent 3.0 is a portable, core Prolog system that can run under any OS 
or GUI environment, and can be easily extended to map to the features of 
that environment.

Cogent 3.0 lets Prolog programmers use the power of Visual Basic, OWL, 
Visual C++ or any other GUI-based tools to implement front-ends on 
Prolog applications.

Conversely, Cogent 3.0 gives C/C++, Visual Basic and other language 
programmers the ability to enhance their applications with the reasoning 
power of Prolog.

The two major enhancements in the 3.0 release are:

 - A new Logic Server API for embedding the Prolog engine in C/C++, 
Visual Basic, Access and other languages. It also lets you add your own 
predicates to Prolog written in C/C++.

 - A new Windows (GUI) Interactive Developer's Environment (IDE) for 
developing Prolog components under Windows. The components will also 
run, unchanged, under any supported environment.

As part of the new architecture, memory mangement was reworked so that 
Prolog is a well-behaved component of any application. 

Further, many built-in functions, such as DOS screen manipulation 
predicates have been removed from the core an re-implemented using the 
API. Full source is included.

For details, see the other articles in this newsletter.

Packaging & Pricing

Cogent Prolog for Windows and DOS is $298. The Compiler /Interpreter-
Only is $149 and the Interpreter-Only is $49.

having lots of fun."

New Logic Server API for Integrating with C/C++, 
Visual Basic and More...
------------------------------------------------

Featured in the Sep/Oct issue of PC AI and the August issue of Dr. 
Dobb's Journal, the biggest news of the 3.0 release is the Logic Server 
API.  With over 50 functions this API allows you to embed the Cogent 
Prolog engine in your C/C++, Visual Basic, Access and other programs as 
well as to write your own predicates in C/C++.

With Cogent 3.0 you will have  three royalty-free options for 
distributing your programs.

 - The supplied runtime.

 - A runtime you customize by adding your own predicates written in 
C/C++.

 - A supplied or custom runtime that is called and managed directly by 
your C/ C++, Visual Basic or other program.  Both LIB and DLL formats 
are provided.

The last 2 options are built using the Logic Server API.

The API is naturally easy to use because it interacts with the runtime 
in a manner very similar to the way you already interact with the ?- 
listener. So not only can you call predicates, you can also query and 
modify the Prolog database, and dynamically add Prolog code and data.

A variety of samples written in C, C++, Visual Basic and Access are 
provided to get you started quickly.

There are 50+ functions to:
 - Load and call Prolog source and object code.
 - Map Prolog terms to and from C/Basic variables.
 - Construct and decompose Prolog queries.
 - Assert/retract predicates.
 - Capture Prolog stream I/O.
 - Handle errors.

The API supports the following compilers:
   MS Visual C++ 1.5
   Borland C/C++ 4.0
   Watcom C/C++ 10


Cogent Compatibility from 2.0 to 3.0
------------------------------------

In order to make Cogent 3.0 portable across environments and embeddable 
in other languages and systems, we had to remove the embedded support 
for DOS text-mode windows and graphics that were included in the 2.0 
release.

So, the old DOS shell, CPSHL, has been replaced by a new, more powerful 
Windows-based Interactive Development Environment (IDE).

Unfortunately, another effect of removing the text windowing is that 
HyperBase is not compatible with 3.0 out of the box. However, with the 
new Logic Server API, appropriate predicates (such as the WinBoss 
shareware library) could be easily incorporated into your own custom 
runtime.

We also used the API to move a number of DOS-dependent predicates out of 
the core runtime. These predicates, including new mouse support, are 
provided as external Prolog and 'C' modules. Incidentally, they also 
illustrate the API as they are delivered in both source and object form.

The Logic Server API supplants the Cogent Connections from release 2.0, 
although the old calls are still available. Please let us know if you 
are using them.


Cogent Prolog Available on the 64-bit Alpha
-------------------------------------------

Further illustration of the new portability of Cogent Prolog are the 
OSF/1 and OpenVMS editions for DEC's new Alpha. These editions are 
source and object code compatible with the DOS and Windows editions. 

The OSF/1 edition supports the full 64-bit addressing for heaps, stacks, 
programs and data.

Both editions include all of Cogent's command-line tools, plus the Logic 
Server API and full samples. They are priced at $995 for the first seat, 
with discounts for additional seats.


More 3.0 Enhancements
---------------------

In addition to the major enhancements described on the front page, some 
others are worth noting.

 - The Logic Server API lets you capture and manage Prolog's I/O 
streams, making it possible to connect the Cogent engine to any GUI or 
windowing package. For example, we implemented a full interface to 
Menuet in two weeks for Pacific AI in Canada.

 - New .INI file parameters help overcome limits when reading very large 
terms.

 - New keyboard predicates for DOS were added.

 - DOS mouse support is provided in both source and object form. This is 
a good example of the new open architecture of 3.0 as the predicates 
were implemented using the Logic Server API.

 - The samples now include some object oriented techniques. And the 
Useful Utilities and Techniques & Examples Tool Boxes have been 
incorporated into the 3.0 sample code.


Joint Marketing Opportunities and User-Contributed Software
-----------------------------------------------------------

The new open architecture of 3.0 makes it easy to extend Cogent Prolog, 
as well as to embed it in other applications.

We are interested in pursuing joint marketing arrangements with anyone 
who builds useful tools or interfaces with Cogent Prolog. 

Also, starting with the 3.0 release of Cogent Prolog, we will be 
including user contributed utilities, samples and similar items on the 
standard distribution disks and on our Internet FTP/Gopher site.

The 3.0 disks now include a lint program. Lint flags syntatically 
correct Prolog code that is probably not what you intended.  It was 
contributed by F.M. Brown.

If you have anything you would like us to distribute or market, please 
contact us.

Amzi! Consulting Services
-------------------------

Amzi! is available for a variety of contract consulting services in the 
areas of Prolog, C/C++, Visual Basic and Expert Systems.

Most of our work to-date has been concentrated in two areas:

 - First, we can port the Cogent runtime engine, command line tools and 
Logic Server API to any machine with an ANSI standard 'C' compiler.

 - Second, we can extend the Cogent engine by building custom routines, 
or by interfacing to an existing library, operating environment or other 
API.

Our interests extend well beyond these two areas, so please contact us 
with your project requirements.


Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

We will be shipping all upgrade orders the first week of January. 
Domestic orders will ship via U.P.S. or Priority Mail. International 
orders will ship via Air Mail.

In an attempt to make a fair and comprehensible upgrade, we have opted 
for a scheme which charges the full price for the new versions and then 
provides you with a credit for products you already own.  

Also the packaging for version 3.0 has changed. The full Cogent Prolog 
system ($298) includes what was formerly called the Compiler & 
Interpreter and Linker & Runtime. Hence, the Linker & Runtime is no 
longer a separate product. As always you can upgrade from one product to 
the next.

If you have multiple copies of Cogent Prolog, please contact us directly 
for pricing.
