Name:         Expert

Summary:      An expert system written in ADA.

Version:      1.0 (3-DEC-85)

Description: 

   EXPERT is a backward chaining (goal driven) expert system.  It is
   based on two articles. The first (Duda and Gaschnig, September 1981
   BYTE) published the expert system in BASIC skirting the use of
   recursion, and the second (Darrell Morgeson, Jan/Feb 85 issue of
   JOURNAL OF PASCAL, ADA, & MODULA-2) published in Modula-2 with
   recursion implemented.  The listing had one logic error which caused
   pointer explosion on the last hypothesis in the GETRULE routine.  This
   implementation follows the MODULA-2 design completely and was not
   designed from the ground up in Ada.  Many improvements would be
   possible if more time permitted my working on this.

Requires:     ADA
