Package:      areas/expert/systems/ops5/

Name:         OPS5

Summary:      RETE-based expert system shell.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains the original public domain implementation
   of an OPS5 interpreter written by Charles L. Forgy and ported to
   Common Lisp by George Wood and Jim Kowalski. Also included is an
   updated version with several bug fixes and ports by Mark Kantrowitz.

   Charles Forgy, the inventor of Rete and OPS5, has a company that sells RAL
   (Rule-extended Algorithmic Language), a high-performance C-based
   expert systems tool. RAL uses a more efficient match algorithm called
   Rete II and was designed to permit seamless integration of rules and
   objects into C programs.  RAL is a superset of C.  RAL rules can
   operate directly on the data types used by the C code in your
   application.  RAL "understands" C type declarations, function
   prototypes, #define constants, and so on.  C expressions, statements,
   macros, function calls, and so on can be embedded directly in the
   rules.  RAL has an open architecture that permits it to be used with
   any GUI builder, data base library, or other library that can be used
   with C.  No bridges are required.  For efficiency, RAL rules are
   compiled into C code. A special version of the language, called
   RAL/RT, adds the features that are required for real-time expert
   systems.  RAL and RAL/RT have a multi-windowed, point-and-click
   development environment called the RAL Workbench.  RAL and RAL/RT are
   available for DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, and UNIX.  License fees for
   development systems are available on request. There are no run-time
   fees charged for distributing applications developed using RAL.  For
   information about RAL, write Production Systems Technologies, Inc.,
