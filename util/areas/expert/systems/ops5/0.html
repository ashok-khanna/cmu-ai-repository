<H2>OPS5: RETE-based expert system shell.</H2>

This directory contains the original public domain implementation
of an OPS5 interpreter written by Charles L. Forgy and ported to
Common Lisp by George Wood and Jim Kowalski. Also included is an
updated version with several bug fixes and ports by Mark Kantrowitz.

Charles Forgy, the inventor of Rete and OPS5, has a company that sells RAL
(Rule-extended Algorithmic Language), a high-performance C-based
expert systems tool. RAL uses a more efficient match algorithm called
Rete II and was designed to permit seamless integration of rules and
objects into C programs.  RAL is a superset of C.  RAL rules can
operate directly on the data types used by the C code in your
application.  RAL "understands" C type declarations, function
prototypes, #define constants, and so on.  C expressions, statements,
macros, function calls, and so on can be embedded directly in the
rules.  RAL has an open architecture that permits it to be used with
any GUI builder, data base library, or other library that can be used
with C.  No bridges are required.  For efficiency, RAL rules are
compiled into C code. A special version of the language, called
RAL/RT, adds the features that are required for real-time expert
systems.  RAL and RAL/RT have a multi-windowed, point-and-click
development environment called the RAL Workbench.  RAL and RAL/RT are
available for DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, and UNIX.  License fees for
development systems are available on request. There are no run-time
fees charged for distributing applications developed using RAL.  For
information about RAL, write Production Systems Technologies, Inc.,
