Summary:      Prolog Expert System Building Tool

Version:      1-FEB-89

Description: 

   This is a cut-down version of the expert system building tool produced
   by Steven Salvini as part of his M.Sc. dissertation in 1986. 

   PROTEST is a tool for building prototype expert systems.  It accepts a
   knowledge base written in IF-THEN rules whose conditions and conclusions
   consist of object/attribute/value triples:

       rule1:
           if
                   pain/duration/constant
               and
                   pain/localisation/accurate
               and
                   pain/'initiated by'/'gentle touch'
               and
                   pain/character/'sudden onset'
               and
                   pain/character/'intense & throbbing'
               and
                   gingivae/swelling/present
               and
                   gingivae/erythema/present
               and
                   miscellaneous/'local lymphadenopathy'/present
               and
                   pain/'initiated by'/'clenching, biting or chewing'
               and
                   tooth/mobility/present
           then
               diagnosis/group/abscess
           with
               certainty(0.9).

   Conclusions may contain certainty factors.

   Inference can be either backward chaining or mixed. The former is
   normal backward chaining, giving a single firm conclusion if one has
   been deduced or else as a list of possible conclusions in order of
   their certainties.

   Mixed mode is a "mixed" inference strategy which first prompts you to
   enter your initial findings and then tries to deduce one or more of
   the goals. If a firm conclusion is not reached, it then tries to solve
   the problem by backward-chaining.

   After PROTEST has given a conclusion, you can ask to see its chain of
   reasoning.

   A sample knowledge base, for dental diagnosis, is included.
