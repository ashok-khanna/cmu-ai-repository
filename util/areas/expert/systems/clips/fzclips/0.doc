Summary:      Fuzzy Logic Extensions for CLIPS

Description:

   FuzzyCLIPS is a version of the CLIPS rule-based expert system
   shell with extensions for representing and manipulating fuzzy facts
   and rules. In addition to the CLIPS functionality, FuzzyCLIPS can deal
   with exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy
   and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an
   expert system. The system uses two basic inexact concepts, fuzziness
   and uncertainty. 
   
   Please read the terms for use in the FuzzyCLIPS documentation
   before using.  
   
   FuzzyCLIPS was developed at the Institute for Information Technology
   (Knowledge Systems Lab) of the National Research Council of Canada.
