Package:      areas/expert/systems/clips/fzclips/wxfuzzy/

Name:         wxCLIPS

Summary:      wxCLIPS integrated with FuzzyCLIPS

Version:      6.02 

Description: 

   wxCLIPS is an extension to CLIPS that provides a useful set of GUI
   capabilities with CLIPS. It was written by Julian Smart of the AI
   Applications Institute, University of Edinburgh. This directory
   contains a version of wxCLIPS that has been merged with FuzzyCLIPS in
   a test mode. It includes versions of wxfuzzy for the PC and for Sun
   systems. 

   At this time they are ONLY created with the previous version of
   FuzzyCLIPS (6.02) and NOT with the current version (6.02A). Eventually
   it will be made available in its entirety through Julian Smart's ftp
   site. Try the test version. There is a rather nice demo of the shower
   problem.

   Please read the terms for use in the FuzzyCLIPS documentation
   before using.  

   FuzzyCLIPS was developed at the Institute for Information Technology
   (Knowledge Systems Lab) of the National Research Council of Canada.
