Subject 	: AGENT_CLIPS  (Multi-Agent tool)  will be implemented.
Date		: 12-17-94
From		: 73313.775@compuserve.com  (Yilmaz Cengeloglu)

AGENT_CLIPS is a multi-agent tool for Macintosh. 
Multiple copies of CLIPS runs at the same time on 
MACINTOSH.  Each Agent (CLIPS) can send commands 
to other active agents at run time.  AGENT_CLIPS 
will be handling  incoming commands automaticly.
 
Command transfer is also mean that you can  exchange
facts, rules at run time.   This is a form of Knowledge
Exchange Among Intelligent Agents. I am also author of
DYNACLIPS which is a similar tool for UNIX.  AGENT_CLIPS
will NOT use blackboard for communication. That is the reason
I am using different name.  I might add BBA functionality in 
the future.

If you are interested  with this tool  please send me a mail. 
If there would be enough interest,  I will make this tool
available  to  other people.  Otherwise  I will be implemeted
for only  my  own usage.  Version 1.0  might  be FREE. 

Please feel free to make any comment.

AGENT_CLIPS Version 1.0 will have at list following commands:
---------------------------------------------------------
SET_AGENT_NAME (<agent name>)
	will be called once to join agents network.

RUN_AGENT
	Will be use to run AGENT_CLIPS.

SEND_MESSAGE_TO_AGENT ( "<destination>"  "<command>")
	<destination> can be an agent or "ALL"  to broadcast the message
	all agents. 
	<command> can be any  CLIPS command. 

EXIT_AGENT_CLIPS
	will be called to exit from agents network.

It will be sloow but I can make it fast  in the future.
