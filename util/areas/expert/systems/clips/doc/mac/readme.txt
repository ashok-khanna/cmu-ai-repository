CLIPS 6.0 Documentation

This directory contains the CLIPS 6.0 Documentation as distributed by
COSMIC. Currently there is one file:

    docs.hqx

which is a binhex format file that can be transferred to a Macintosh
system and decoded with one of many binhex conversion programs.
This will result in a file called 'CLIPS Documentation' which is
a self-extracting file. By double clicking on this file it will
create a directory with the 4 documentation files in Microsoft
Word format.
