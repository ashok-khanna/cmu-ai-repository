 1) WHAT IS CLIPS?
------------------
    CLIPS is a productive development and delivery expert system tool which
    provides a complete environment for the construction of rule and/or 
    object based expert systems. CLIPS is being used by over 5,000 users 
    throughout the public and private community including: all NASA sites 
    and branches of the military, numerous federal bureaus, government 
    contractors, universities, and many companies. The key features of 
    CLIPS are: 

    *  Knowledge Representation: CLIPS provides a cohesive tool for handling 
       a wide variety of knowledge with support for three different 
       programming paradigms: rule-based, object-oriented and procedural. 
       Rule-based programming allows knowledge to be represented as 
       heuristics, or "rules of thumb," which specify a set of actions to be 
       performed for a given situation. Object-oriented programming allows 
       complex systems to be modeled as modular components (which can be 
       easily reused to model other systems or to create new components). 
       The procedural programming capabilities provided by CLIPS are similar 
       to capabilities found in languages such as C, Pascal, Ada, and LISP.
    
    *  Portability: CLIPS is written in C for portability and speed and has
       been installed on many different computers without code changes. 
       Computers on which CLIPS has been tested include IBM PC compatibles,
       Macintosh, VAX 11/780, and Sun 3/260. CLIPS can be ported to any 
       system which has an ANSI compliant C compiler. CLIPS comes with all 
       source code which can be modified or tailored to meet a user's 
       specific needs.
    
    *  Integration/Extensibility: CLIPS can be embedded within procedural 
       code, called as a subroutine, and integrated with languages such as 
       C, FORTRAN and ADA. CLIPS can be easily extended by a user through 
       the use of several well-defined protocols.
    
    *  Interactive Development: The standard version of CLIPS provides an
       interactive, text oriented development environment, including 
       debugging aids, on-line help, and an integrated editor. Interfaces 
       providing features such as pulldown menus, integrated editors, and
       multiple windows have been developed for the Macintosh, Windows 3.1, 
       and X Window environments.
    
    *  Verification/Validation: CLIPS includes a number of features to 
       support the verification and validation of expert systems including 
       support for modular design and partitioning of a knowledge base, 
       static and dynamic constraint checking of slot values and function 
       arguments, and semantic analysis of rule patterns to determine if 
       inconsistencies could prevent a rule from firing or generate an error.
    
    *  Fully Documented: CLIPS comes with extensive documentation including 
       a Reference Manual and a User's Guide.

 3) WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 6.0 OF CLIPS?
---------------------------------------
    CLIPS version 6.0 contains the following major enhancements and changes:

    *  Instances of user-defined clases in COOL can be pattern-matched
       on the left-hand side of rules.

    *  The defmodule construct allows a knowledge base to be modularized
       and partitioned.

    *  Not conditional elements may now contain CEs other than pattern CEs.
       The exists and forall CEs have been added. Connective constraints
       can be used with multifield variables.

    *  Static and dynamic constraint checking are supported to a much greater
       extent than in CLIPS 5.1. In addition to deftemplates, COOL also 
       performs constraint checking. Many of the features previously available 
       in CRSV are now directly supported in CLIPS.

    *  Deftemplates can now contain more than one multifield slot.

    *  The syntax for the defclass construct has been considerably
       changed.

    *  A Windows 3.1 CLIPS interface is now available for PC compatible
       computers. In addition, an MS-DOS 386 version of CLIPS is available
       which can use extended memory.

 4) CAN CLIPS BE REDISTRIBUTED? ARE THERE ANY LICENSING FEES?
-------------------------------------------------------------
    Copies of CLIPS purchased through COSMIC can be freely used and
    redistributed without restrictions. This is the mechanism through 
    which companies, such as the Austin Code Works or Network Cybernetics 
    Corporation, can redistribute CLIPS. The redistribution restrictions, 
    or lack thereof, also apply to any individual or company that has a
    copy of CLIPS that can trace its origins back to a purchase from 
    COSMIC. For example, if you buy a copy of CLIPS from the Austin Code 
    Works or you download a copy of CLIPS from an anonymous ftp site that 
    purchased a copy from COSMIC, you can freely use and redistribute the 
    copy you obtained.
    
    Users who receive CLIPS from the Software Technology Help Desk may
    only use CLIPS in connection with the specific project under which it 
    was provided and no further use or dissemination can be made without 
    prior written permission.

 5) WHAT FORUMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT CLIPS?
------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you have problems using or installing CLIPS, the Software Technology 
    Branch (STB) Help Desk can be contacted at (713) 286-8919 from 9:00 a.m. 
    to 4:00 p.m. (Central Standard Time). Leave your name and number and a 
    support person will get back to you. The STB Help Desk can also be 
    reached via electronic mail at <stbprod@fdr.jsc.nasa.gov> or by FAX at 
    (713) 244-5698. 
    
    ------------------------

    An electronic conferencing facility is also available to CLIPS users. 
    Subscribers to this facility may send questions, observations, answers, 
    editorials, etc., in the form of electronic mail to the conference. 
    All subscribers will have a copy of these messages reflected back to 
    them at their respective electronic mail addresses to process at their 
    leisure. All that is required is that you have an electronic mail address 
    that is accessible either directly on the Internet or via a gateway 
    connected thereto (e.g., BITNET or NASAMAIL). To subscribe, simply send 
    a single line message to listserv@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu saying 
    SUBSCRIBE CLIPS-LIST (the hyphen is required).  The subject field is 
    ignored but the address found in the 'Reply:', 'Reply to:', or 'From:' 
    field will be entered in the distribution list.  Upon subscription you 
    will receive a mail message instructing you how to participate in the 
    conference from that point forward.
    
    To send your own messages to members of the conference you need
    simply address your mail to "clips-list@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu".
    Your message will be reflected to all other members of the
    conference.  If you want to reply directly to a single member of
    the conference you should send mail to their personal address.
    This will help 'minimize bandwidth' and reduce the amount of
    irrelevant messages others have to scan.
    
    If you wish to remove yourself from the conference and discontinue
    receiving mail simply send a message to "listserv@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu" 
    with "UNSUBSCRIBE CLIPS-LIST" being the text of the message.  If you 
    appear to be experiencing difficulties at our end please send E-mail to 
    "service@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu". If you need to talk to a person about 
    your (CLIPS-LIST) problems, you may call (706) 542-3265 and ask to speak 
    with the Electronic Conference Sysop.

    and containing a subset of the features found in the C version of CLIPS.
    CLIPS/Ada version 4.4 contains all of the features found in CLIPS/C
    version 4.3, and with the exception of the CLIPS Object-Oriented 
    Language, all of the features found in CLIPS/C version 5.0. There are
    currently no plans to update CLIPS/Ada to a more recent version of
    CLIPS/C. CLIPS/Ada can be obtained through the Software Technology 
    Branch Help Desk (free for NASA and its contractors) or COSMIC
    ($400 for the program and $21 for the documentation). 

 8) WHEN'S THE NEXT CLIPS CONFERENCE?
---------------------------------------------
    The Third CLIPS Conference will be held at NASA's Johnson Space
    Center in Houston, Texas on September 12-14, 1994. The Software
    Technology Branch of NASA/Johnson Space Center has developed
    numerous software technologies in support of institutional and
    space systems development and operations. The purpose of the

 9) IS THE CLIPS USER'S GROUP STILL ACTIVE?
-------------------------------------------
    Apparently not. Several individuals have had problems contacting
    all but a few of the officers. At the next CLIPS conference,
    we'll try to determine if there's enough interest to warrant
    restarting the group.

10) ARE THERE ANY COPIES OF THE CLIPS CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS LEFT?
------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are copies of both the First and Second CLIPS Conference
    Proceedings (see question #2 for information on contacting the
    STB Help Desk to obtain a copy).

11) ARE THERE ANY RECENT REVIEWS OF CLIPS?
------------------------------------------
    The two most recent reviews of CLIPS are "The Art of Production
    Systems" by Tom Brooke in the January 1992 issue of AI Expert
    and "A Comparative Evaluation of Expert System Tools" by
    Dr. William Mettrey in the February 1991 issue of IEEE Computer.
    A bibliography list of CLIPS related books, papers, and 
    articles is available via anonymous ftp from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov
    in the /pub/clips/Documents directory. The help desk also has
    copies of an evaluation by Dr. William Mettrey which compares
    ART-IM, CLIPS, KES, Knowledge Craft, LEVEL5, and Vax OPS5 (see 
    question #2 for information on contacting the STB Help Desk to 
    obtain a copy).
        
12) ARE THERE ANY SOURCES DESCRIBING APPLICATIONS BUILT USING CLIPS? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
    There are a number of sources describing applications built 
    using CLIPS. The 1st and 2nd CLIPS Conference Proceedings are
    a good place to start. In addition, the STB Help Desk has a 
    booklet containing CLIPS application abstracts (see question #2 
    for information on contacting the STB Help Desk to obtain a copy).
    The abstracts booklet is also available via anonymous ftp from
    hubble.jsc.nasa.gov. The /pub/clips/Documents directory contains 
    abstract.sea.hqx (a binhexed self extracting archive of the abstracts 
    booklet in Macintosh Microsoft Word 5.1 format) and abstract.zip (a
    binary file in pkzip format in Word for Windows 2.0 format). A 
    bibliography list of CLIPS related books, papers, and articles is 
    also available in the /pub/clips/Documents directory.

    If you'd like to share information with other CLIPS users about 
    your CLIPS applications, please provide the following information:

    *	The name of your expert system.
    *	Its purpose (briefÑone or two sentences).
    *	Development stage (conceptual, developing, alpha testing, beta 
        testing, finished).
    *	Other Languages/Shells used.
    *	Papers or other references that describe your application.
    *	Contact person (name, organization, address, phone, fax, email 
        address, etc).
    *	Description of your application (no more than a page or so).

    Send the information by either mail, fax, or electronic mail to
    the STB Products Help Desk.

    Since the primary purpose of this booklet is to provide CLIPS users 
    the opportunity to contact other individuals developing applications 
    of interest, we're limiting the applications listed in this booklet 
    to those that provide at least some source of further information 
    (such as a mail address, email address, phone number, or reference 
    other than the CLIPS conference proceedings). In either case, we're 
    still interested in hearing about any applications you've developed.

    ------------------------

    The Proceedings of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Innovative 
    Applications of Artificial Intelligence also contain descriptions
    of applications built using CLIPS ("An Intelligent Training System 
    for Space Shuttle Flight Controllers" and "Space Shuttle Telemetry 
    Monitoring" in the First, "HUB SIAASHING: A Knowledge-Based System 
    for Severe, Temporary Airline Schedule Reduction" in the Fourth,
    and "PI-in-a-Box: A Knowledge-based System for Space Science 
    Experimentation" and "The DRAIR Advisor: A Knowledge-Based System 
    for Materiel Deficiency Analysis" in the Fifth).

    FuzzyCLIPS 6.02 is an extended version of CLIPS 6.02 for representing  
    and manipulating fuzzy facts and rules. In addition to the CLIPS 
    functionality, FuzzyCLIPS can deal with exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and 
    combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy and normal terms to be freely mixed 
    in the rules and facts of an expert system. The system uses two basic 
    inexact concepts, fuzziness and uncertainty.It was developed by the
    Knowledge Systems Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada 
    (and is a different tool than the previously mentioned FuzzyCLIPS 1.5 
    developed by Togai InfraLogic). FuzzyCLIPS is available via anonymous 
    ftp from ai.iit.nrc.ca in the directory /pub/fzclips. FuzzyCLIPS is 
    also available via WWW (the World Wide Web). It can be accessed 
    indirectly by accessing the Knowledge Systems Lab Server using the URL 
    http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/home_page.html or more directly by using the URL 
    http://ai.iit.nrc.ca/fuzzy/fuzzy.html. Versions are available for unix 
    systems, Macintosh systems and PC systems. There is no cost for the 
    software, but please read the terms for use in the FuzzyCLIPS 
    documentation or in the WWW FuzzyCLIPS pages. For further information 
    or queries about FuzzyCLIPS please direct messages to 
    fzclips@ai.iit.nrc.ca. The file nrc-fuzzy-clips available by anonymous 
    ftp from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov in the directory /pub/clips/Documents 
    contains additional information on obtaining FuzzyCLIPS.

    CLIPsTOOL, developed by Dr. Terry Feagin, is an extension of CLIPS
    6.0 that allows the CLIPS programmer to create windows, items (such
    as buttons, sliders, checkboxes, gauges, textfields, etc.) within 
    windows, menus, notices or alerts, etc., to draw lines, rectangles, 
    circles, etc. in color/patterns in windows, to load/save images 
    into/from a window, etc. from the RHS of a CLIPS rule (or in fact 
    from the CLIPS> prompt if desired).  Events such as mouse clicks, 
    keyboard entry, closing or quitting from a window, etc. cause facts 
    to be asserted so that subsequent rules can fire. It's all written
    in X and uses the XView toolkit (distributed with X).  At present, 
    it runs on Sun workstations (an IBM RS/6000 version is underway). 
    Discounts are available for universities and government. For more 
    information, send email to feagin@cl.uh.edu or write to Knoware, 
    P.O. Box 977, Seabrook, TX  77586-0977.
  
    DYNACLIPS (DYNAamic CLIPS Utilities), developed by Yilmaz Cengeloglu,
    is a set of blackboard, dynamic knowledge exchange, and agent tools
    for either CLIPS 5.1 or CLIPS 6.0. It is a set of libraries that can 
    be linked with CLIPS. The file daynaclips available by anonymous ftp  
    from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov in the directory /pub/clips/Documents contains 
    additional information. DYNACLIPS V3.0 (for CLIPS 5.1 or 6.0 on UNIX)
    can be downloaded by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.cmu.edu. The file 
    dyna_v3.tar.gz is in the user/ai/areas/expert/systems/clips/dyna/v3
    directory.
    
    The Washington University School of Medicine has developed some data 
    base library functions which provide a Sybase interface for CLIPS 6.0.
    The file clips-sybase available by anonymous ftp from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov 
    in the directory /pub/clips/Documents contains additional information. 
    The source code and documentation are available via anonymous ftp on
    wuarchive.wustl.edu. The file names are README and clips2sybase.tar.uu,
    and can be found in the /packages/clips2sybase/v6.01 directory. There is
    also a version for CLIPS 5.1 in the /packages/clips2sybase/v5.1 directory.

15) CAN CLIPS ACCESS EXTENDED MEMORY BEYOND THE DOS 640K LIMIT ON A PC?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The executables distributed with versions of CLIPS prior to CLIPS
    6.0 were not able to access extended memory on IBM PC compatible
    computers. The CLIPS 6.0 PC distribution package comes with a DOS 
    386 executable and a Windows 3.1 executable both of which can 
    access extended memory. The DOS and the Windows 3.1  executable 
    requires a 386 microprocessor or better.

    The DOSX memory manager used by the 386 version of CLIPS is compatible
    with Microsoft's himem.sys, ramdrive.sys, and smartdrv.sys; Qualitas 
    386^MAX version 5.0 and above; and IBM's vdisk.sys. If an extended 
    memory manager is available, then DOSX will use it to allocate extended 
    memory, otherwise DOSX will allocate the extended memory itself.

    A DOS 286 CLIPS executable with all features enabled that also uses 
    extended memory cannot be generated because of limitations on the 
    amount of static data (< 64K). By disabling features, an 286 executable 
    can be created which contains less than 64K of static data and also has 
    access to extended memory. Generating the executable requires the use of
    DOS Extender (either a separate product or one bundled with the compiler).
 
    A DOS 86 executable which has access to extended memory can not be 
    created, however it is possible to create a CLIPS executable that can
    run within the DOS 640K memory limit by disabling features.
    
16) CAN CLIPS BE COMPILED USING A C++ COMPILER?
-----------------------------------------------
    CLIPS was designed to support both the older Kernighan and Ritchie (K&R)
    C compilers and C compilers based on the ANSI C standard. C++ is not a 
    proper superset of ANSI C, and therefore some ANSI compliant code cannot 
    be compiled using a pure C++ compiler. Specifically, old style K&R  
    function declarations, which are used throughout CLIPS in conjuction with 
    both K&R and ANSI style prototypes, either do not compile or have
    different meanings in C++. Thus, CLIPS can not be compiled using a pure
    C++ compiler. Many C++ compilers provide an option which allows the use 
    of K&R style function declarations. In addition, it is also possible link
    CLIPS object files generated using a C compiler with object files 
    generated by a C++ compiler.

17) DOES COOL STORE ITS OBJECTS AS C++ DATA STRUCTURES? 
    ARE THERE ANY PLANS TO CONVERT CLIPS TO C++?
-------------------------------------------------------
    CLIPS was written to conform to the ANSI C standard. It was also written 
    to be as compatible as possible with the older K&R style compilers.
    Since the object extensions of C++ are not part of the ANSI C standard,
    they are not utilized in the CLIPS source code. There are no plans to
    convert the CLIPS source code to C++.

18) HOW CAN I INTEGRATE CLIPS AS A C PROGRAM WITH OTHER C++ PROGRAMS?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    The file clips-and-c++ available by anonymous ftp from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov
    in the directory /pub/clips/Documents describes how CLIPS source files
    compiled as C programs can be integrated with C++ files compiled using a 
    C++ compiler.

19) IS A DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS VERSION OF CLIPS?
    HOW DO I USE CLIPS WITH OTHER WINDOWS 3.1 APPLICATIONS?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL) for CLIPS 6.0 is not available.
    A DLL for CLIPS 5.1 is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.cmu.edu.
    in the directory /pub/clips/incoming. The file clips-and-windows 
    available by anonymous ftp from hubble.jsc.nasa.gov in the directory 
    /pub/clips/Documents describes three techniques for using CLIPS with other 
    Windows 3.1 applications (embedding CLIPS into your Windows application, 
    creating CLIPS as a DLL, or using Dynamic Data Exchange).

20) WHAT ARE THE ORIGINS OF CLIPS?
----------------------------------  
    The origins of CLIPS date back to 1984 at NASA's Johnson Space Center. 
    At this time, the Artificial Intelligence Section (now the Software 
    Technology Branch) had developed over a dozen prototype expert systems 
    applications using state-of-the-art hardware and software. However, 
    despite extensive demonstrations of the potential of expert systems, 
    few of these applications were put into regular use. This failure to 
    provide expert systems technology within NASA's operational computing 
    constraints could largely be traced to the use of LISP as the base 
    language for nearly all expert system software tools at that time.

    The Artificial Intelligence Section felt that the use of a conventional 
    language, such as C, would eliminate most of these problems. Although a
    number of tool vendors started converting their tools to run in C, the 
    cost of each tool was still very high, most were restricted to a small 
    variety of computers, and the projected availability times were 
    discouraging. To meet all of its needs in a timely and cost effective 
    manner, it became evident that the Artificial Intelligence Section would 
    have to develop its own C based expert system tool.

    The prototype version of CLIPS was developed in 1985. Particular 
    attention was given to making the tool compatible with expert systems 
    under development at that time. Thus, the syntax of CLIPS was made to 
    very closely resemble the syntax of a subset of the ART expert system 
    tool developed by Inference Corporation. Although originally modelled 
    from ART, CLIPS was developed entirely without assistance from 
    Inference or access to the ART source code.

    The original intent of the prototype was to gain useful insight and 
    knowledge about the construction of expert system tools and to lay the 
    groundwork for the construction of a fully usable tool. The CLIPS 
    prototype had numerous shortcomings, however, it demonstrated the 
    feasibility of the project concept. After additional development, it 
    became apparent that sufficient enhancements to the prototype would 
    produce a low cost expert system tool that would be ideal for the 
    purposes of training. Another year of development and internal use went 
    into CLIPS improving its portability, performance, and functionality.
    The first release of CLIPS to groups outside of NASA occurred in 1986.

    Further enhancements transformed CLIPS from a training tool into a tool 
    useful for the development and delivery of expert systems as well.
    Subsequent enhancements to CLIPS extended it beyond its initial 
    representation methodology of forward chaining rules by adding 
    procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.

21) ARE THERE ANY LANGUAGES SIMILAR TO CLIPS?
---------------------------------------------
    CLIPS is an interesting example of technology transfer between the 
    government and private sectors. Syntactically, CLIPS traces its origins 
    to Inference's ART which traced the origins of its rule-based language 
    to OPS5. Later, CLIPS was used by Inference to develop ART-IM and by 
    The Haley Enterprise to develop Eclipse. In the early days of CLIPS
    development, porting an application from CLIPS to ART was fairly easy
    (although the reverse was not necessarily true if many of the advanced
    features of ART were utilized). In recent years, the features and
    capabilities of CLIPS, ART-IM, and Eclipse have diverged sufficiently
    that porting from one to the other is no longer a trivial task. Still,
    the basic syntax of their rules remains very similar and the flavor of
    the languages is more or less the same. For more information on either
    ART-IM or Eclipse, contact respectively Inference or The Haley Enterprise.

22) DID INFERENCE AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLIPS?
--------------------------------------------------
    Over the last several years, there has been a persistent group of 
    rumours to the effect that either Inference developed CLIPS for NASA
    or that NASA used the ART source code to develop CLIPS. Neither of 
    these statements are true. To set the matter straight, there is not a  
    single line of CLIPS source code that was either written by Inference 
    or given to NASA by Inference. In addition, NASA never had access to 
    the ART source code.
   
23) WHAT ARE THE FUTURE PLANS FOR CLIPS?
----------------------------------------
    After eight years of development and the release of version 6.0
    of CLIPS, our list of "must have" features has become very short.
    We haven't made any plans to begin work on the next major release
    of CLIPS. We will, of course, continue to maintain the CLIPS code
    and have minor releases when necessary to fix bugs or provide
    minor new capabilities. We intend to complete the CLIPS 6.0
    Architecture Manual and have it available sometime in 1994.
    
    It is likely that we will develop a Windows Dynamic Link Library
    and support Macintosh AppleEvents for the next major release of
    CLIPS. The development of a class browswer for the machine specific 
    interfaces is also a possibility.
    
    Likely new capabilities for the next major release of CLIPS would
    be temporal reasoning, inheritance by generalization, and 
    persistent objects.
    
24) CAN CLIPS BE USED FOR REAL TIME APPLICATIONS?
-------------------------------------------------
    Yes and no. It depends on what you mean by a real time application.
    
    If you want guaranteed response time, then the answer is no. Note 
    that even tools specifically designed for real time applications 
    like G2 and RTworks can't give you guaranteed response times. 
    Generally speaking, the more robust the pattern matching capabilities 
    of a tool, the more difficult it is to guarantee real time response.
    
    If you need built-in functionality that allows you reason about events
    as they occur over time, then the answer is no. Many tools designed
    for real time applications provide features that allow you (among other
    things) to schedule rules to be checked at a particular time or on a 
    particular time interval, specify how long data is valid, determine 
    trends in data (such as whether it's increasing or decreasing), and 
    synchronize the execution of tasks. In addition, some tools such as G2,
    provide extensive facilities for the "non AI" related aspects of
    developing a real time application such as the graphical interface,
    simulation, and data acquisition. It's possible to use CLIPS to reason
    about events as they occur over time--It's just not a built-in feature.
    You can, for example, add an additional slot to facts which stores their 
    creation time and then use rules which reason based on the contents of
    this slot.

    If by real time you mean that the application is able to keep up with
    the data as it is received, then the answer is maybe. Almost all 
    expert system tools can keep up with a real time system that only
    requires decisions to be made in minutes/hours/days. Response time
    tends to become an issue only when large amounts of data are being
    processed or decisions are required every few seconds.
    
    If you need really, really fast response time, then the answer is maybe.
    Of course, my definition of really, really fast is probably different
    than yours, so let me quantity that: if you need responses faster than
    every 1 to 2 seconds, then CLIPS will probably not be fast enough. 
    Again, even tools such as G2 are probably not capable of dealing with
    data rates in the milliseconds. The smallest time increment available 
    in G2 for scheduling a rule is one second, so even if G2 is capable of
    receiving data several times a second, it's not capable of processing
    the data within that time frame.

    CLIPS is based on the Rete pattern matching algorithm. The efficiency
    of this algorithm is based on the assumption that data changes slowly
    over time (e.g. a single rule firing affects < 5% of all facts). This
    assumption would appear to fail miserably for monitoring applications
    (as well as other applications where rapid data change can occur). If,
    for example, you have 100 facts representing various sensor values and 
    the sensor values change every second, you have very rapid data changes 
    (assuming you don't have thousands and thousands of facts of other 
    types). It's often possible to comply with the Rete assumption by
    preprocessing data. For example, if a sensor value changes from 10 to 
    10.1 and this change is not significant, then it's not necessary to
    retract the old fact and assert a new fact with the changed sensor
    value. Another preprocessing approach would be to convert numeric 
    values to symbolic values such as low, nominal, and high and then to
    retract the old fact and assert a new one only if the symbolic value
    changed. The major drawback to this approach is that you generally have
    to write C code to preprocess the data and keep track of pointers to
    facts so that facts can later be retracted by the preprocessor--Of
    course if you're dealing with real-time data, you're probably writing
    some C code anyway.

25) IS THE CLIPS 6.0 ARCHITECTURE MANUAL AVAILABLE?
---------------------------------------------------
    We have not yet completed the 6.0 Architecture Manual. Copies of the
    CLIPS 5.1 Architecture Manual are still available.
    
26) ARE THERE ANY CLIPS EXAMPLE PROGRAMS?
-----------------------------------------
    A few programs (some of which were done by students from an expert 
    systems course) are available by anonymous ftp from 
    hubble.jsc.nasa.gov in the directory /pub/clips/Programs.
    
    ------------------------
    
    COSMIC sells several CLIPS related programs:
    
    The Design Manager's Aid for Intelligent Decomposition (DeMAID) is a 
    knowledge-based system for ordering the sequence of modules and 
    identifying a possible multilevel structure for the problem design. 
    It was developed using CLIPS 4.3.
    
    The CLIPS Intelligent Tutoring System (CLIPSITS) is designed to be used
    to learn CLIPS. CLIPSITS is divided into 10 lessons which mirror the
    first 10 chapters of the CLIPS User's Guide. CLIPSITS is compatible 
    with the Version 4.2 and 4.3 CLIPS User's Guide, however, the program
    does not cover any new features of CLIPS 4.3 that were added since
    the release of CLIPS 4.2.
    
    The Expert Script Generator (ESG) is a software package that 
    automatically generates high-level task objective commands for a 
    complex menu-driven language used for telerobotics control. It was
    developed using CLIPS 4.2.

    For more information on these programs, contact COSMIC (see question #2).
    
27) ARE TRAINING CLASSES FOR CLIPS AVAILABLE?
---------------------------------------------
    The STB Help Desk no longer provides CLIPS training courses.
        
    S.E.T.A.P (Software Engineering, Training, And Programming) offers CLIPS 
    Training. Expert Systems classes (taught in Houston, Texas) are available 
    on the following dates:

    Dr. David Goldstein, Assistant Professor at North Carolina A&T State 
    University, offers two short courses: "Building Expert Systems" and 
    "Developing Object-Oriented Knowledge-Based Systems." Both are two
    day courses and cost $625.

    "Building Expert Systems" teaches the theoretic fundamentals of 
    knowledge-based systems, the design techniques of knowledge-based systems, 
    and will present how to implement knowledge-based systems using CLIPS. 
    Students will attain a working knowledge of terminology, techniques, and 
    tools, and will be given hands-on experience using CLIPS. Students will  
    also build several small systems. No prerequisites are required. Course  
    notes and a copy of CLIPS will be provided.
    
    "Developing Object-Oriented Knowledge-Based Systems" presents how to 
    implement sophisticated intelligent systems. Students will be given 
    hands-on experience using CLIPS by building several small systems.  
    Course topics include: truth-maintenance; probabilistic reasoning; 
    object-oriented knowledge-based systems; using CLIPS for intelligent  
    database queries; embedding CLIPS for knowledge-based control systems. A  
    discussion of research around the world on knowledge-based systems,  
    including real-time systems and distributed artificial intelligence  
    (cooperative systems) will occur. Prerequisites are the "Building Expert 
    Systems" Short Course or an expert systems or artificial intelligence 
    course. Course notes and overheads will be provided, as well as a copy of 
    CLIPS.
    
    For more information, contact David Goldstein by email at goldstn@ncat.edu
    or write to him at the Computer Science Department, Graham Hall, NCA&T  
    State University, Greensboro, NC 27411.

28) HOW DO I UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THE CLIPS LIST SERVER?
----------------------------------------------------
    If you wish to remove yourself from the conference and discontinue
    receiving mail simply send a message to "listserv@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu" 
    with "UNSUBSCRIBE CLIPS-LIST" being the text of the message.  If you 
    appear to be experiencing difficulties at our end please send E-mail to 
    "service@cossack.cosmic.uga.edu". If you need to talk to a person about 
    your (CLIPS-LIST) problems, you may call (706) 542-3265 and ask to speak 
    with the Electronic Conference Sysop.

29) WHAT DOES THE "SCRIPT LINE 7" ERROR MESSAGE MEAN?
-----------------------------------------------------
    An early version of the CLIPS 6.0 PC installer has a bug that under
    some circumstances will cause an error message. The cryptic 
    "script line 7" error message usually occurs in two situations:

    1) There is not enough hard disk space available to install the files.
       Remember that it takes more than N megabytes of hard disk space
       to install N megabytes of files since the installer will move the
       compressed files to the hard disk and then decompress them. You 
       can prevent this problem if you make sure that you have enough
       free disk space available (full installation takes up about 12
       MB, so 20 MB should be more than safe).

    2) The installer has problems if the directory structure or files from 
       a previous installation already exist. To get around this, you can 
       reinstall to a different directory or delete the existing directories 
       and files before reinstalling. If situation #1 occurs, you will have 
       this problem if you free up hard disk space, but don't delete the 
       directories and files that were partially installed.

30) ARE THERE ANY EXAMPLES OF USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS OTHER 
    THAN THE ONES IN THE ADVANCE PROGRAMMING GUIDE? 
----------------------------------------------------------
    Virtually all of the system defined functions that come ready to use 
    with CLIPS utilize the same programming interface that you have to
    use to define your own functions. Look through files such as bmathfun.c, 
    iofun.c, miscfun.c, prdctfun.c, emathfun.c, filecom.c, and multifun.c 
    for examples.
