DYNACLIPS:Blackboard, Dynamic Knowledge Exchange, Agents tool for CLIPS

DYNACLIPS (DYNAamic CLIPS Utilities) Version 2.0

I have released a DYNACLIPS Version 1.0 a month  ago.
There were enough interest therefore I will possible work on 
Version 2.0,  if I would have spare time. 

Most people complain  that :
        There is no DYNACLIPS for  CLIPS Version 6.0.
	There is not enough  documentation.
	It is not very user  friendly. 
	There is no DYNACLIPS for Mac, PC or some other systems. 
	It is not possible to add Agents in C, C++, etc.

***
Please let me know if you want to add anything on this list. 
***

If you are using DYNACLIPS Version 1.0
for any project or  considering to use it in the future, 
please let me know that you are possible active user.
Although, I have distribute DYNACLIPS more than 200 people, 
I have no knowledge of active users.

Most people are more interested using DYNACLIPS as a
Blackboard Architecture tool. This tool designed to
show that Dynamic Knowledge Exchange is possible and 
would be useful in some application. If you have any
application that Dynamic knowledge Exchange would be a 
a good solution and would like to share it please
let me know. I will post the results if there would be
enough response.

BACKGROUND :

I have used Blackboard Architecture as a base and design a
Framework. In this Framework,  each Intelligent agent is an
CLIPS shell and runs as a different process on SunOS operating System.

Agents uses blackboard to communicate with other Intelligent agents
in the framework.  Each intelligent Agent can send/receive facts, rules,
commands. Rules and Facts are inserted/deleted dynamicly while agents are
running. Knowledge can be transfered as a temporary any permanent basis.
