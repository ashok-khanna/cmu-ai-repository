This mail contains following: 
 1- Possible extentions for next Versions
 2- Most common errors/warnings  when you use DYNACLIPS. 

I have tried to compile all mails I have received 
related with Version 1.0 and 2.0.

Yilmaz Cengeloglu



-----------------------------------------
1-) Possible extentions for  NEXT Versions of DYNACLIPS.
-----------------------------------------

** Ability to send message to group of agents.
     Currently DYNACLIPS sends message to all
     agents or one agents. 
     Following will be in next Version.
        Loading an Agent 
             dynaclips <agent.clp> <agentID> [groupID]

       Syntax for AD_BB_STR and DEL_BB_STR will be
        ADD_BB_STR "ALL  ................."
                   "<groupID> ............"
                   "<agentID> ............"

       (member of group <groupID>) will be a fact
       If agent needs to know its parent. you can get
       group name from this fact.

    (It is DONE, on TEST). 


** Improve C/C++ interface..
     Currently, you can use 
        sendbb  "message" 
     program to  add/delete message to blackboard.
     Many people asked for libraries that can be linked
     with C/C++ therefore they can call functions rather
     than executing sendbb with system command. 
  
    (I am considering to do it) 


** DISTRIBUTED  DYNACLIPS ?
   
    It is not a big deal to distribute to different computers.
    New communication protocol should be set up and new utilities 
    for communication should be written. It takes time and requireds 
    hardware. Distributed CLIPS would have limited usage.

   (I have no plan to work on it)


** Improve Error messages.
   For instance,
       Control: WARNING, Fact is already in the Backboard
    Specify which  fact ?
 
   (It  is partly DONE)


** DYNACLIPS for PC, MAC, etc. 
  I do not have access to different platforms at this time. 





************
If you have anything to add this list
plase, let me know..
***********
 
                





-------------------------------------------------------
 2- Most common errors/warnings  when you use DYNACLIPS.
-------------------------------------------------------


**  " ...msgsnd failed!!!: No more processes"
-------------------------------------------------------

This error means that Queue is in Operating system is full.
Control is not fast enough to handle incoming requiests from
agents.
   Possible reasons ... 
     -- One of the agents continuously sends add/or delete
        request  to control. When you design your system you should
        not add something to blackboard if it is already there 
        by other agents. Also you should not try to delete something
        if it is not in blackboard.
        Following is one of the  possible solutions. 
       
            If   not (hi there) 
                  then ADD_BB_STR (ALL FACT (hi there) )

            if   (hi there)
                  then DEL_BB_STR (ALL FACT (hi there) )

     -- Your computer system is slow. 



** What is the best way for one-to-one communications. 
-------------------------------------------------------

You can send a assert command to other agents. In
that case you do not have to waste space in the blackboard..
   
for instance, agent2 calls:

ADD_BB_STR "agent1 COMMAND ( assert (xxxx) )"

(xxxx) will be a fact in the agent1 and it will 
not stay in the blackboard. Therefore you do not
need to remove it from BB. Also you do not need to
specify destination in the fact..


** Following is one of the most common mistakes.
-------------------------------------------------------

  (xxxx) is a fact in the blackboard..

 An agent has following rule
     
    (defrule CCC
        ?msg <- (xxxx)
        =>
        (retract ?msg)
         )

You should NOT retract a fact which is a member of blackboard..
If you need to retract it you should remove it from BB using
DEL_BB_STR. 
after CCC is  rule excuted,  (xxxx)  will be in fact list again.
You can not remove it with retract.

     
*** I'd like to use this <agent id> in the clips code  
-------------------------------------------------------
(knowledge source name is <agentID>) is an initial fact
in all agents. 



** Following is one of the most common mistake.
-------------------------------------------------------
In order to exit from system properly, 
you should have following rule in all agents.

(defrule exit-all
(all exit)
=>
(EXIT_CLIPS))


** Following is one of the most common mistake.
-------------------------------------------------------

This mail contains following:
 
  1- Problem with deleting fact from Blackboard
  2- Speed of Control and Agents.
 
 
 1- Problem with deleting fact from Blackboard
------------------------------------------------
 
causse@vision.auc.dk is reported following problem..
 
add A FACT (xx)  --> insert this fact (xx) to agent A
del A FACT (xx)  --> delete this fact (xx) from agent A
 
It is deleting fact (xx) from agent A  BUT all other
agents are reseting their fact base.
 
if you bradcast the fact  and delete, there is no problem.
 
add ALL FACT (xx)  --> insert this fact (xx) to all agent
del ALL FACT (xx)  --> delete this fact (xx) from all agent
 
 
I have fixed this problem. It will be release soon.
If you are not deleting a fact from specific agent
you should not have any problem.
 
 
 
2- Speed of Control and Agents .
-----------------------
>> from gmoore@macktech.com
>>It appears that the control program is polling the blackboard.  When
>>control is started, cpu utilization jumps to 100% and stays there.
>>Are there any plans to fix this (using signals, etc) so that it doesn't
>>chew up all the cpu cycles?
 
It is true.
 
If there is no requests from agents, control is still
is polling message queues.
 
If there is no rule to fire, agents  are still polling the blackbord.
 
 
I have partly solve this problem...
 
 if there is no request,  control is sleeping until any
                 agents make requests.
 
 if there is no rule to fire, agent is sleeping until
                 something is changed in the blackbord.
 
This one is  realy need good testing before release. Results were
OK in my internal testing.
 
It might be something that I have missed which might
be cause for a deadlock.
 
-------------
Both problems are also exists in DYNACLIPS Version 1.0 for CLIPS 5.1.
Currently, I have no plan to make work on version 1.0.
I might change my mind depending on number of requests.
 
I will be needing couple of people before making next relase,
please let me know if you are interested.
 
Thanks

 1- DYNACLIPS Version 3.0 for CLIPS 5.1 and CLIPS 6.0 




------------------------------------------------------
 1- DYNACLIPS Version 3.0 for CLIPS 5.1 and CLIPS 6.0 
------------------------------------------------------


I have found out that there are too many people who
are using DYNACLIPS for CLIPS 5.1.

DYNACLIPS Version 3.0 will support both CLIPS 5.1 and CLIPS 6.0.
It is almost ready. I am doing my internal testing. 

In case, it would be some bug, I will not add this version
to CMU AI Repository for a while. 

If you not want to wait to FTP, You can request a copy from me now.
I will begin to distrubute within a week or less.

Please continue to make comments.




What is new ..
--------------------------------------------------------------

** All necessary libraries to link with CLIPS 5.1 and CLIPS 6.0
   are included. You can set it up for both version of CLIPS. 

** Ability to send message to group of agents.
     Currently DYNACLIPS sends message to all
     agents or one agents. 

     Following is in Version 3.0.
        Loading an Agent 
             dynaclips <agent.clp> <agentID> [groupID]

       Syntax for AD_BB_STR and DEL_BB_STR will be
        ADD_BB_STR "ALL  ................."
                   "<groupID> ............"
                   "<agentID> ............"
        New Command :
         CHANGE_GROUP_NAME "groupID"

       (member of group <groupID>) will be a fact
       If agent needs to know its parent. you can get
       group name from this fact.



** Improve C/C++ interface..
     Currently, you can use 
        sendbb  "message" 
     program to  add/delete message to blackboard.
     Many people asked for libraries that can be linked
     with C/C++ therefore they can call functions rather
     than executing sendbb with system command. 

     This library is included in Version 3.0. You can only 
     add/delete something to blackboard with C program. 
     You are not able to read contents of blackboard .
  


** Improve Error messages.
 
** Problem with deleting a fact from Blackboard
   This problem is fixed.  


** Speed of Control and Agents.
  
 if there is no request,  control is sleeping until any
                 agents make requests.

 if there is no rule to fire, agent is sleeping until
                 something is changed in the blackbord.

 1- Why DYNACLIPS 3.0  is not in CMU AI Repository.
 2- Some comments on speed.


Yilmaz Cengeloglu


--------------------------------------------------
1- Why DYNACLIPS 3.0  is not in CMU AI Repository.
--------------------------------------------------
DYNACLIPS 3.0  has a major changes. 
I was not able to test it myself very well.  I will wait
for a while. As of today, there is no problem reported.


-------------------------------------- 
2- Some comments on speed.
-------------------------------------- 

There are still complains about speed of DYNACLIPS. I have done
my best to get speed up on DYNACLIPS. If you have any suggestions
please let me know.


Followings are reason why DYNACLIPS would be slow. 
-------------- 
** Some of you use several agents (10 or more)  in their project.
Each agent is a CLIPS shell and they all run simultaneously. 
You need a faster CLIPS and/or faster workstation. 
I have add an  a algorithm that
if any agents does not have any rule to fire, it will sleep. 
Agent will wake up if there would be any change in the blackboard.
There is nothing else  I can do in this case. If you have any 
comment let me know.


-------------- 
** You have some agent that continously sending request to control. 

For instance, 
   (yyyy)  and (mmmm) are  facts in the blackbord. 

Agent 1 has following rule
  
  if (mmmm) insert (yyyy) to blackboard. 

  This rule will slow down whole system because agents 1
will continously send that request to control which is not
necessary to handle at all. 

One of the solution would be. 
  
 if (mmmm) and  ( not (yyyy) ) insert (yyyy) to blackboard. 


-------------- 
**   You have too many one to one continous communication. You should 
try to use blackboard for exchanging common information. For
one to one communication you may want to use other approaches
such as IPC message queues, etc. 

 
-------------- 
** Some of you are suggested that Each agents should run on
separate CPU ( Distributed DYNACLIPS). Of course this the best
solution for speed up  but not everyone has access to  distributed
hardware.  Number of distributed DYNACLIPS  user is not good enough for me
to make work on it.

This is not not easy to fix immediately. Each agent sends a acknowledge
signal to control when it reads blackboard succesfully. They do not send
their ID.
 
Control only knows number of active agent in the system and does not
keep names of the agents in the system.  If number of incoming acknowledge
signal less than number of agent, it will give a warning.
 
I have not passed Agent ID  because it was bringing additional job
to control and it would slow down whole system. Control has to keep
list of active agent in the system and has to compare with incoming
signals each time blackboard broadcasted.
 
I am not really sure that this is really necessary to implement.
 
 
Control: WARNING, Some KS did not READ Blackboard means following :
        1- an agent is in indefinite loop can not read blackboard
        2- an agent exits from system without caling EXIT_CLIPS command.
        3- an agent is waiting input from user.
        4- an agent is to slow to respond to control.

one suggestions.

------------------------------

DYNACLIPS (DYNAamic CLIPS Utilities), is a set of blackboard, dynamic
knowledge exchange, and agent tools for CLIPS 5.1 and 6.0.  It is
implemented as a set of libraries that can be linked with CLIPS 5.1 or
CLIPS 6.0. Version 1 should be used with CLIPS 5.1 and version 2 with
CLIPS 6.0.  Source code is not available. Agents use the blackboard to
communicate with other intelligent agents in the framework.  Each
intelligent agent can send and receive facts, rules, and commands.
Rules and facts are inserted and deleted dynamicly while the agents
are running. Knowledge can be transfered on a temporary or permanent
basis. For more information, please contact Yilmaz Cengeloglu, PO Box
il to
cengelog@dab.ge.com or 73313.775@compuserve.com.
It is available from the CMU AI Repository in

    with CLIPS 5.1 or CLIPS 6.0

    DYNACLIPS Version 3.1 will not be at CMU AI repository couple
    of weeks.

    Let me know if you want a copy of DYNACLIPS Version 3.1.


Thanks in advance,

1- DYNACLIPS 3.1 for CLIPS 6.02
----------------------------------------------------
DYNACLIPS 3.1 for CLIPS 6.02 is being distributed. 
you need to request from me. 

2- Publication.
----------------------------------------------------
It will be a publication at Third CLIPS conference in 
September. 



3- USING DYNACLIPS in DIS and IST applications.
----------------------------------------------------

There has been several questions regarding on using DYNACLIPS
in DIS and IST applications. Followings are my opinions.  


DIS:

Currently, DYNACLIPS  can  NOT be connected to DIS network
because it does not understand DIS protocol. 

DYNACLIPS can be used as an intelligent forces in the military 
simulation network. For instance, officers and soldiers can be modelled
as intelligent agents and an intelligent agent representing an 
officer can dynamically transfer appropriate knowledge to each
soldier according to each soldier's specific condition at the time.
Another example, an aircraft can be modelled as an DYNACLIPS, each agent
is representing a complex behavior in the aircraft. Such as, 
one agent for take off/landing, one agent for escaping, one agent for
attack, etc. In this case,  unnecessary knowledge would be sleep, 
if it is not being used. Also you can re-use knowledge bases that are
similar in different simulators. Such as, you may be able to use same
escaping knowledge base for  different flight simulators.


IST:

DYNACLIPS can be used for Intelligent Simulation and Training applications.
As I have done in my thesis, ATC can be modelled, each agent represent
a plane.  This would increase the reality  of the simulation. ATC person
can be trained using more real simulations.

The most difficult  part is someone needs to write knowledge bases for
each complex behaviors in DIS or IST applications.

Using different technique DYNACLIPS can be enhanced. DYNACLIPS is still 
prototype.

---Rest  is information about DYNACLIPS --------------

DYNACLIPS can be used as a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange
tool for Intelligent Agents. It is a basic Blackboard
Architecture. Each intelligent agent in DYNACLIPS is a
CLIPS shell and runs a separate process under SunOS
operating system. Intelligent agents can exchange facts,
rules, and CLIPS commands at run time. System V  IPC
facilities (shared memory, message queues, semaphores)
are used for interprocess communication. DYNACLIPS is
FREE and several people are currently using it.

DYNACLIPS for CLIPS 5.1 and 6.0 can be
downloaded from ftp.cs.cmu.edu. Files are in
user/ai/software/expert/clips/dyna directory.

DYNACLIPS for CLIPS 6.02 can be requested from me.

1- I have received couple of mails asking about status of
   DYNACLIPS. 
 
  As you know, latest version is 3.1 and runs with CLIPS
  5.1, 6.0 and 6.02. 
 
  Lately, I have not receive any serious bug report. Therefore
  I am not working on another version at this time.
 
  It will be a publication at CLIPS conference on September 14.
 
 
 
2- Please update my address in your file.

	DYNACLIPS is still a prototype tool and there are several
limitations. I am still working on DYNACLIPS whenever I have chance.
Since I am working on it as a hobby,  it is going to slow.
	
	It used to be cases that some people asked special functionality
and I was not able to respond.   It is really hard to make a tool that
makes everyone happy.  

	My intention to develop this tool was to be able to use dynamic 
rule exchange.  I think %90 of people who tried DYNACLIPS are interested 
to use as a BBA tool.

	I think DYNACLIPS is good enough for quick prototyping at this
time. Couple of people tried symbolic version of GBB and they did claim 
that they have to learn several new things to be able use GBB. Since
unix version of GBB is too expensive, most people do not prefer to buy 
it unless they really need a BBA tool. 
 		
	There are also other tools that are presented at CLIPS conference, 
you might want to make some research on them.


	I also would not mind to get copy of responses you will get.

Subject 	: AGENT_CLIPS  (Multi-Agent tool)  will be implemented.
Date		: 12-17-94
From		: 73313.775@compuserve.com  (Yilmaz Cengeloglu)

AGENT_CLIPS is a multi-agent tool for Macintosh. 
Multiple copies of CLIPS runs at the same time on 
MACINTOSH.  Each Agent (CLIPS) can send commands 
to other active agents at run time.  AGENT_CLIPS 
will be handling  incoming commands automaticly.
 
Command transfer is also mean that you can  exchange
facts, rules at run time.   This is a form of Knowledge
Exchange Among Intelligent Agents. I am also author of
DYNACLIPS which is a similar tool for UNIX.  AGENT_CLIPS
will NOT use blackboard for communication. That is the reason
I am using different name.  I might add BBA functionality in 
the future.

If you are interested  with this tool  please send me a mail. 
If there would be enough interest,  I will make this tool
available  to  other people.  Otherwise  I will be implemeted
for only  my  own usage.  Version 1.0  might  be FREE. 

Please feel free to make any comment.

AGENT_CLIPS Version 1.0 will have at list following commands:
---------------------------------------------------------
SET_AGENT_NAME (<agent name>)
	will be called once to join agents network.

RUN_AGENT
	Will be use to run AGENT_CLIPS.

SEND_MESSAGE_TO_AGENT ( "<destination>"  "<command>")
	<destination> can be an agent or "ALL"  to broadcast the message
	all agents. 
	<command> can be any  CLIPS command. 

EXIT_AGENT_CLIPS
	will be called to exit from agents network.

It will be sloow but I can make it fast  in the future.
