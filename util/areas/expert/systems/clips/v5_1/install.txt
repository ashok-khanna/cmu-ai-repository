Thanks again to those who helped me. For any one who will be wanting to try this
installation it is fairly painless once in the know.

	1.	copy each zip file onto a separate disk
	2.	unzip the data on that disk
	3.	label the disk as per the zip file eg CLIPS511.ZIP -> CLIPS511
	4.	select 1st disk
	5.	run instalit from the a: drive
	6.	follow the on screen instructions

I had a small problem with the last disk, but the system is now up and running
and confusing me.
