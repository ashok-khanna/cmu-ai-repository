Version:      2.4.3 (8-NOV-93); 2.4.2 (30-JUL-93); Mac (2-FEB-94)

Description: 

   PAIL (Portable AI Lab) is a computing environment containing a
   collection of state-of-the-art AI tools, examples, and documentation.
   It is aimed at those involved in AI courses (teaching or learning) at
   university level or equivalent. The system has enough built-in
   functionality to enable its users to get practical experience with a
   broad range of AI problems without having to build all the supporting
   tools from scratch. It is implemented in Common Lisp and uses CLOS and
   Allegro Common Windows (i.e., in Allegro CL 4.1).

   PAIL is designed around a set of modules, each of which includes a
   fully implemented and documented computational kernel together with a
   representative set of autonomous demonstrations and running examples.
   The modules also provide appropriate graphic visualizations for the
   presentation of key algorithms and concepts.  In addition, sufficient
   documentation is provided to enable the user to retrieve key
   literature references, understand the architecture and specifics of
   the implementation, and modify the implementation if desired.

   PAIL's current modules cover the following topics
      - Automated Theorem Proving
      - Natural Language Processing
      - Rule-Based Inference
      - Truth Maintenance Systems
      - Constraint Satisfaction Problems
      - Learning
      - Knowledge Acquisition
      - Genetic Algorithms
      - Neural Networks

Requires:     Common Lisp, CLOS, Allegro Common Windows
