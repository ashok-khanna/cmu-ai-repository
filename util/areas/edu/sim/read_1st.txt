This is SIM, Software similarity tester, most recent revision (2.7, 930222).
by Dick Grune, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (dick@cs.vu.nl).

SIM tests lexical similarity in texts in C, Pascal, Modula-2, Lisp and
natural language. It is used
- to detect potentially duplicated code fragments in large software projects,
- to detect plagiarism in software projects, educational and otherwise.

It is available for UNIX (in source code) and MSDOS (executables only).

UNIX:
	To obtain the files, do:
		gunzip sim_2_7.shar.gz
		sh sim_2_7.shar
	This unpacks the sources, the Makefile, sim.1 and READ_ME.
	For installation notes and other info then see READ_ME.

MSDOS:
	To obtain the files, do:
		[pk]unzip SIM_2_7.zip
	This unpacks the executables, SIM.DOC and READ.ME.
	For other info then see READ.ME.

Changes from Release 1.21, as posted in comp.sources.unix (1987):
	Ported to MSDOS
	Significant speed improvements
	New options: -e, -S and / , to compare files group-wise
	New option: -F , to require function names to match exactly
	Lisp version added
	Miscellaneous improvements

Changes from Release 1.6, as posted in comp.sources.unix (1985/6):
	Modula-2 version added
	Text version added
	Better (correct) parsing of comments in C
