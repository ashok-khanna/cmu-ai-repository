Subject: A reading list for a "Connectionism and Parallel Dist. Proc." course
     
After months of brainstorming (er, inaction), here comes at last the
promised reading list for Indiana U.'s planned connectionism course,
78 items long--just right for a semester.  IU's a liberal arts school,
after all. :-)
