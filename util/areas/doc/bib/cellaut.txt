[ The following is a cross-post from the above newsgroups - Moderator ]
 
  Here's are a few references on cellular automata, followed by some
specific refs for Conway's game of Life.  I also have a brief list of
CA simulators that are available.  Send me a note if you'd like a copy
of that list.
  Also, there is a newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata, for discussion
of any topics related to CA.
 
 
=== general CA references ===
 
		     Cellular automata literature
 
  The collection mentioned below is not intended to be a bibliography on
cellular automata.  Instead, it is a list a few of the books and journals
that carry CA information.  By getting a few of the books, or looking through
some of the CA articles in the journals, you can consult the bibliographies
there to find references to many specific CA articles.
 
 
 
 - The "Physica D" journal
      This is a journal specializing in nonlinear phenomena.
      Volume 10 (1984) held the proceedings of the 1983 CA conference
      held at Los Alamos.  This volume is also available as a book,
      called "Cellular Automata", edited by Farmer et al.
      The proceedings of the '89 CA conference will be out sometime in
      late 1990.
 
 - "Cellular Automata Machines" by Tommaso Toffoli and Norman Margolus
   (MIT Press, 1987).
      This book is an excellent introduction to using CA for physical
      modeling.  It uses the Forth language to describe the CA rules,
      which many people don't like, but it's still the best book around
      in my opinion.  Something you should definitely read if you're at
      all interested in the physical applications of CA.  This book is
      available for $32.50 (that includes postage within the US) from:
            Automatrix, Inc.
            P.O. Box 196
            Rexford, NY 12148-0196
      (add $3.00 overseas).  Automatrix produces various CA products
      as well.
 
 - "Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata", edited by Stephen Wolfram
   (World Scientific, 1986).
      A collection of articles about just what the title says.  It is more
      biased toward theory than the previous book, although there are still
      plenty of applications.  This is also something to have on your shelf
      if you're interested in CA.
 
 - "Lattice Gas Methods for Partial Differential Equations",
   edited by Gary Doolen et al (Addison-Wesley, 1989)
      This is a collection of reprints and some new articles.  Most of them
      are about lattice gas models, but there are some other applications as
      well.  This is one of the books in the Santa Fe Institute's "Studies in
      the Sciences of Complexity" series.  For information on this series,
      write to:   Santa Fe Institute
                  1120 Canyon Road
                  Santa Fe, NM 87501  USA
 
 - The "Complex Systems" journal.
      This carries many CA related articles.  For information write to:
                Complex Systems Publications, Inc.
                P.O. Box 6149
                Champaign, IL 61821-8149  USA
