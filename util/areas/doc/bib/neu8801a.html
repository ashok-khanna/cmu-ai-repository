In Article 122 of comp.ai.neural-nets, johnson@c10sd1.StPaul.NCR.COM
(Wayne Johnson) posts references to recent literature on neural nets.
For my own use, I thought I'd like to collect this material in a more
structured format, and make it the nucleus of a bibliography.  Thus the
following is the beginning of a refer-format bibliography on neural net
models/computing based on the material already posted by Wayne Johnson
plus some additional material I found around the house.  If anyone would
care to E-mail me additional references, corrections/additions to the
following list, etc. I'll be glad to include them with acknowledgements
In future postings.  New material will be referenced in NEU8802A.BIB,
etc. Corrections/addenda will be posted (as diffs) in NEU8801B.BIB, etc.

%X A neat hatchet job by the leaders of the 'Symbolic Programming' school of
   Artificial Intelligence, on the 'Network' school; probably responsible
   for the latter appearing to be brain dead for the next decade.  Contains
   extensive mathematical analysis of 1-layer networks.

   research in a field that was officially pronounced dead in 1969 (by Minsky

%X A very good source of connectionist/neural net software is available
   from MIT Press.  The package consists of IBM binaries and source
   (UNIX/IBM compatible)to code that implements the following models:
                - interactive competition
                - constraint satisfaction
                        * schema model
                        * Boltzmann machine
                        * harmonium
                - PDP learning models
                        * Hebbian
                        * generalized delta (back-propogation)
                - other learning models
                        * auto-association
                        * competitive learning
   All the source is provided (written in C). As well a handbook is
   provided which describes the simulations and the theory underlying
   these. The price is US$ 27.50 - a steal!
