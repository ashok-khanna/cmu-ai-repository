Reply-To: ashwin@cc.gatech.edu (Ashwin Ram)

Mark,

I think your FAQ is a great idea.  Yes, it does seem a little biased in
places, but with contributions from the audience it should even out in time.
At Georgia Tech we have a standard reading list for our qualifying exams for
admission to PhD candidacy, which is a list of readings we consider important
and fundamental, covering a wide range of AI topics.  You might consider
adding these references to your lists since they cover a pretty broad range
of approaches and schools of thought.
