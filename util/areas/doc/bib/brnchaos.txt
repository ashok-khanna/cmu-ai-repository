We should not blithely assume that natural systems are describably in
terms of dynamical theory, but I know what you mean.

The evidence is very strong that chaos is both necessary and useful for
normal nervous activity.  I'm mostly drawing from Freeman here, and that
is still my primary reference.  His claim is that chaos is the natural
"background activity" level of neural systems.  This is evidenced by all
EEG readings and his own research specifically in the olfactory cortices
or rabbits.  You can calculate the fractal dimension between 4 and 6.
This is useful to prevent "entrainment" of neural response, typified by
seizures (too regular behavior).  Against this background activity (rest
state), perceptions stand out as low-dimensional cyclic attractors.
 
This is complex stuff, and I'd strongly advise reading the original by
Skarda and Freeman and the excellent series of review articles which
followed by neurolgoists, cognitive scientists, etc.  (Rene Thom
commented).  I wrote a review paper on this which I could post, but the
originals are better.  Bibliography follows.
