%X Corel is an experimental retrieval system that employs techniques of
artificial intelligence.  Articles of the Civil Code of Louisiana have been
conceptually indexed using frame-based knowledge structures in hope of
improving accessibility over traditional key-word retrieval systems.  A set
of macro packages has been developed to allow a domain expert to
implement a retrieval system based on this methodology.

%X The Civil Code Legal Information Processing System (CCLIPS) is a conceptual
retrieval system whose domain is the Louisiana Civil Code.  Statutes are
coded in Atomically Normalized Form (ANF) and entered into a database.  Legal
situations are entered by the user in ANF and relevant statutes are retrieved.
We discuss the current status of the system and some plans for further
development.

%T Lisp and Prolog Memory Performance
%A Evan Tick
%D January 1986
%I Stanford University Computer Systems Laboratory
%X This  report presents a comparison between a Lisp and Prolog architecture bas
ed
on memory performance.  Four Lisp programs were translated into Common Lisp and
Prolog abstract  machine  instruction  sets.    The  translated  programs  were
emulated  and  memory  reference  counts  collected.    Memory usage statistics
indicate how the two languages do fundamental computations different ways  with
varying efficiency.  Additional measurements of production systems running on a
conventional host are presented.

A Prolog machine design and its control are described.   The  machine  features
two-stage  pipelining,  a  triple bus interconnection data path and support for
concurrent control of micro-operations.  The objective of  this  design  is  to
improve  execution  of a Prolog processor by simultaneously performing multiple
micro-operations.  Capabilities of concurrent operation support  are  described
in  detail  and  demonstrated  using  some example Prolog functions.  Two-stage
pipeline technique as applied to non-deterministic control  of  Prolog  program
execution will be presented.

NIKL (a New Implementation of KL-ONE) is one of the members of the KL-ONE
family of knowledge representation languages.  NIKL has been in use for
several years and our experiences have led us to define and implement various
extensions to the language, its support environment and the implementation.
Our experiences are particular to the use of NIKL.  However, the requirements
that we have discovered are relevant to any intelligent system that must
reason about terminology.  This article reports on the extensions that we have
found necessary based on experiences in several different testbeds.  The
motivations for the extensions and future plans are also presented.

%X This paper presents a technique for interpreting output demands by a natural
language sentence generator in a formally transparent and efficient way.
These demands are stated in a logical language.  A network knowledge base
organizes the concepts of the application domain into categories known to the
generator.  The logical expressions are interpreted by the generator using the
knowledge base and a restricted, but efficient, hybrid knowledge
representation system.  The success of this experiment has led to plans for
the inclusion of this design in both the evolving Penman natural language
generator and the Janus natural language interface.

%I USC/Information Sciences Institute
%D October 1986
%X Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) is a theory of text structure that is
being extended to serve as a theoretical basis for computational text
planning.  Text structure in RST are hierarchic, built on small patterns
called schemas.  The schemas which compose the structural hierarchy of a
text describe the functions of the parts rather than their form
characteristics.  Relations between text parts, comparable to conjunctive
relations, are a prominent part of RST's definitional machinery.
.sp

Recent work on RST has put it onto a new definitional basis.  This paper
describes the current status of descriptive RST, along with efforts to
create a constructive version for use as a basis for programming a text
planner.

%X We describe an automatic programmer, or "compiler" which accepts as input a
predicate calculus specification of a set to generate or a condition to test,
along with a description of the underlying representation of the data.  This
compiler searches a space of possible algorithms for the one that is expected
to be most efficient.  We describe the knowledge that is and is not available
to this compiler, and its corresponding  capabilities and limitations.  This
compiler is now regularly used to produce large programs.

%X The knowledge integration problem arises in rule-based expert systems when
two or more recommendations made by right-hand sides of rules must be
combined.  Current expert systems address this problem either by engineering
the rule set to avoid it, or by using a single integration technique built
into the interpreter, e.g., certainty factor combination.  We argue that
multiple techniques are needed and that their use -- and underlying
assumptions -- should be made explicit.  We identify some of the techniques
used in MYCIN's therapy selection algorithm to integrate the diverse goals it
attempts to satisfy, and suggest how knowledge of such techniques could be
used to support construction, explanation, and maintenance of expert systems.

link to a set of literals that are simultaneously unsatisfiable relative
to a given set of clauses.  We show that theory links may be 'activated' in

%K AI16  AI15
%X To accommodate polymorphic data types and operations, several computer
scientists - most notably MacQueen, Plotkin, and Sethi -- have proposed
formalizing types as ideas.  Although this approach is intuitively
appealing, the resulting type system is both complex and restrictive
because the type constructor that creates function types in [sic] not
monotonic, and hence not computable.  As a result, types cannot be
treated as data values, precluding the formalization of type constructors
and polymorphic program modules (where types are values) as higher order
computable functions.  Moreover, recursive definitions of new types do not
necessarily have solutions.
.sp
sp
This paper proposes a new formulation of types -- called intervals-- that
subsumes the theory of types as ideals, yet avoids the pathologies caused
by non-monotonic type constructors.  In particular, the set of interval
types contains the set of ideal types as a proper subset and all the
primitive type operations on intervals are extensions of the corresponding
operations on ideas.  Nevertheless, all of the primitive interval type
constructors including the function type constructor and type quantifiers
are computable operations.  Consequently, types are higher order data
values that can be freely manipulated within programs.

%X Non-hierarchical statistical decision algorithms spend a significant
portion of their time entertaining incorrect hypotheses in multiple class,
pattern recognition problems.  Maximum-likelihood multivariatie-Gaussian (MLMVG)
hypotheses testing is a common example of such a statistical pattern
rognition technique.  It is shown that the use of out of class covariance
matrices can significantly reduce the run-time computations required to
make MLMVG decisions.  The Analysis directly leads to an objective
dimensionality reduction (ODR) technique that indicate the preferred,
intrinsic dimensionality omultiple class decision spaces given the training
data.  Run-time computatio/ns are reduced even further using these reduced
dimension class decision spaces with dimensionality reduction technique to
stress the essential concepts of out-of-class covariance.  The theory has been
applied to a nine(9) class, twenty-seven (27) feature, automatic visual solder
joint inspection problem with excellent results; run-time computations
are reduced by more than a factor of three while maintaining excellent design
performance.

AI research in text generation needs a strong linguistically justified
descriptive theory as a basis for creating methods by which programs can write
multiparagraph texts.  This paper sketches Rhetorical Structure Theory, which
has been designed to support text generation, and then applies RST to
describing a particular class of discourse constructs.
.sp
sp
There is no consensus as to the status of clause combining relations relative
to larger texts.  This paper demonstrates a clause combining relation that is
also found as part of larger text structures, and shows how this fact can be
used to explain cases in which contrastive clause combining appears between
clauses that are not in fact in contrast.  The appropriate generalization is
that the relations of clause combining and the relations of general text
structure are the same.  Use of this generalization should make AI text
planning and text generation significantly easier.

One of the tasks in designing a text generation system is to organize the
environment of the grammatical component of the generation system in such a
way that it supports the grammatical resources in generation.  This report
discusses the methods used for the Penman generation system to infer aspects
of the organization of the knowledge base and other components of the
environments of the Nigel grammar of the Penman system.  It is shown how the
design task can be broken down into a number of very explicit demands on the
environment.  In the main part of the report, the results of application of
such an approach is sketched, with particular emphasis on the general
organization of the knowledge base and the discourse model parts of the
environment.

SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR AND FUNCTIONAL UNIFICATION GRAMMAR: Systemic Functional
Grammar (SFG) and Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) are superficially very
different approaches to grammatical knowledge, but they share an underlying
comparability that runs very deep.  FUG shares with systemic descriptions an
emphasis on the functions of linguistic objects, and an explicit
representation of feature choices.  This paper explores how a systemic
grammar can be represented in FUG notation, as a step toward creating a
grammatical analysis program for English.  Because FUG has been developed as a
computational tool, expressing a systemic grammar in FUG notation allows new
computational techniques to be applied to it.  Among other benefits, this
program will make it possible to study how much the grammatical functions of
sentences are recoverable from them. It will also provide a method to test the
amount of ambiguity implicit in a systemic description, a topic which has so
far been inaccessible.  This use of FUG as an alternate representation for SFG
may have some additional benefits for both frameworks.  It provides some
solutions to problems in systemic notation which are described by Matthiessen
(in this volume). Several extensions to the FUG framework are also suggested
by this study.

REPRESENTATIONAL ISSUES IN SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONAL GRAMMAR: Nigel is a large
diverse computational grammar for text generation. Its
framework is an implementation of Systemic Functional Theory of grammar and it
constitutes a context in which the representation of systemic theory can be
explored and studied.

This paper surveys the representational devices used in the Nigel grammar and
the representational issues that they raise in relation to systemic theory.
These issues are diagnosed in the light of the metafunctional differentiation
of systemic theory.
