I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but there was an article on
Cyc in AI Magazine Fall 1990. It was a good introduction, but didn't
have a lot of specifics. It did have many references to articles,books,
and tech. reports done on the Cyc project so far, so it will at least
serve as a useful bibliography. Good luck!

Lenat & Gupta have a new book out on cyc called "building large common sense
reasoning blah blah ..." or something like that.  Lots of detail on the
representation language.  Published by addison-wesley.
 
Also, the Communications of the ACM had a couple articles by Lenat's group a
month or two ago.  You may try there.
 
Good Luck
