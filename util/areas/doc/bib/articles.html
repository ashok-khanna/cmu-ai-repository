in power plant generators, analyze them, and warn plant operators of
potential trouble."  EG&G Idaho of Idaho Falls has a Reactor Safety Assessment
system which "processes large amounts of data from a nuclear power
plant during an emergency, makes diagnoses, and outliens the consequences of
subsequent actions.  After final refinements, this expert system program
is to go on line this year at he Nuclear Regulatory Commison's
Operations Center in Washington Center.  The system was
developed for use with Babcock and Wilcox Pressurized-water reactors and
will be adapted for use with other reactors."  [In Spang-Robinson

%X Micromechanics, the making of mechanical sensors completely out of
semiconductors, is a $250,000,000 business.  Europe is increasing
its market share.  The most widely used devices are pressure sensors
with a silicon chip with a hole etched nearly through it leaving
a thin membrane.  Hitachi sells about a million of such sensors
per year which it sells at ten dollars a piece.  Millar
Instruments puts such sensors at the end of a blood pressure monitor to
take readings inside a blood vessel.  Researchers
at MIT are working on a system that will translate nerve impulses
into controls for prosthetics.  The MIT team anticipates the first
tests on humans with three years.  There are devices with a set of
diving boards for measuring accelerations.  IBM is using such a device
in a pen to detect the hand motions in writing a signature.  This
data is analyzed to determine if there is  a forger.
Texas Instruments is perfecting a silicon chip
with one million mirrors for use in optical computing.

%X We propose an effective method of computation on finite binary trees
that is analogous to the effective computation on the natural numbers
determined by the partial recursive functions.  Not surprisingly, the
method is LISP-like.  A finitely axiomatizable theory is given that is
shown to be just strong enough to represent the class of functions
computable by this method.  Several natural subclasses; of this class
of functions are delineated and they are shown to be different from
one another.

programs are characterized in terms of the domain and range of these
programs.  Most of the results that appear in this paper can easily be

%T Decidability of the Purely Existential Fragment of the Theory of
Term Algebras
%A K.N. Venkararaman
%X This thesis is concerned with the question of the decidability and
the complexity of the decision problem for certain fragments of the
theory of free term algebras.
.sp 1
The existential fragment of the theory of term algebras is shown to be
decidable by presenting a non-deterministic algorithm which given a
quantifier free formula P, constructs a solution for P if it has one
and indicates failure if there are no solutions.  A detailed proof of
the correctness of the algorithm is given.  It is shown that the
decision problem is in NP by proving that if a quantifier-free formula
P has a solution then there is one that can be represented as a dag in
space at most cubic in the length of P.  The decision problem is
shown to be complete for NP by reducing 3-SAT to that problem.  It is
also shown that the @ @ @-[o] hierarchy over a term algebra
corresponds to the polynomial time hierarchy.
.sp 1
The proof of the fact that the introduction of the selector functions
into the first order language does not increase the complexity of the
existential fragment of the theory is indicated.  Thus it is
established that the existential fragment of the theory of list
structures in the language of NIL, CONS, CAR, CDR, = , @u[<] is
NP-complete.
.sp 1
It is shown that the equivalence of PB[;@u{<}] straight line programs
is decidable follows easily from the decidability of the existential
fragment of the theory of list structures.
.sp 1
It is also shown that for any quantifier free formula P (in
the language of a term algebra) there is an algorithm which given a
recursive set S of cardinal numbers @u{<} @ @ @-[o], can decide
whether or not the number of solutions of P is in S.

%X Recent artificial intelligence models of analogical reasoning are
based on mapping some underlying causal network of relations between
analogous situations.  However, causal relations relevant for the
purpose of one analogy may be irrelevant for another.  We describe
here a technique which uses an explicit representation of the purpose
of the analogy to automatically create the relevant causal network.
We illustrate the technique with two case studies in which concepts of
everyday artifacts are learned by analogy.

%T Explanation-Based Generalization: A Unifying View
%A T.M. Mitchell
%A R.M. Keller
%A S.T. Kedar-Cabelli
%X The problem of formulating general concepts from specific training
examples has long been a major focus of machine learning research.
While most previous research has focused on empirical methods for
generalizing from a large number of training examples using no
domain-specific knowledge, in the past few years new methods have been
developed for applying domain-specific knowledge to formulate valid
generalizations from single training examples.  The characteristic
common to these methods is that their ability to generalize from a
single example follows from their ability to explain why the training
example is a  member of the concept being learned.  This paper
proposed a general, domain-independent mechanism, called EBG, that
unifies previous approaches to explanation-based generalization.  The
EBG method is illustrated in the context of several example problems,
and used to contrast several existing systems for explanation-based
generalization.  The perspective on explanation-based generalization
afforded by this general method is also used to identify open research
problems in this area.

%R TR85-8
%I State University of New York at Albany, Computer Science Department
%K AI11
%X We describe the application of graphs that have no induced $P sub 4$
(4 vertex path) subgraphs to automatic theorem proving.  The semantics of
a propositional formula are expressed in terms of the maximal cliques in
a $P sub 4$ free graph rather than by truth assignments.  Arc sets of s-t
paths in a series parallel network provide an equivalent formulation.
We provide combinatorial foundations for Murray and Rosenthal's work
on path resolution (e. g. TR84-1, TR 84-12 and TR 85-4)  For
any graph G, a c-block (resp d-block) is an induced subgraph H in G such
that for all  maximal cliques (resp maximal stable sets) C in G, C $int$
H is $PHI$ or is a maximal clique (resp. maximal stable set) in H.  A
full block is botha c-block and a d-block.  Blocks are generalizations of
substitution subgraphs which occur in Lovasz's work on perfect graphs.
Theorem:  If full block H is $P sub 4$-free then H must arise by
substitution.  Other properties in these blocks in arbitrary graphs and
in $P sub 4$-free graphs are given.  These constructs are instrumental
in the development of several closely related inference rules collectively
referred to as path resolution.  Finally we show how semantics of $P sub 4$
graphs are
generalized to blocking systems by Minty's painting lemma.  This suggests
possible generalization of path resolution to other combinatorial structures.

and complexity of decision problems for the formulas.
Applications to logic and probability:
1) Any reasonable propositional calculus with a reasonable implication
operator has a coNP-hard logical Validy problem.  This is true for very
simple formulas involving or, and and a single occurrence of the implication
operator
2) The set of theorems of the propositional calculus of classical
implicative logic is coNP complete
3. Computing the probabilities of a joint event and a conditional event becomes

%X The TAXMAN project is an experiment in the application of artificial
intelligence to the study of legal reasoning and legal argumentation,
using corporate tax law as an experimental problem domain.  Legal
concepts possess what is often termed "open-texture", that is, their
definitions are subject to a continual process of construction and
modification during the analysis of a contested case.  We have
developed a "prototype-plus-deformation" representation for the
structure of such concepts, a representation which facilitates the
formulation of several systematic methods of conceptual modification.
We propose now to construct a cognitive model of the process of legal
argument, using this representation.  The research is aimed at
developing explanations for the persuasiveness of certain strategies
of legal argument, and at developing further the criteria of
conceptual coherence, both task-specific and task-independent, which
seem to constrain the space of plausible arguments.  We emphasize not
only the contributions of this research to Artificial Intelligence,
but also the insights that may result for some of the fundamental
issues in jurisprudence.

%I Rutgers University Department of Computer Science
%X Concepts often dealt with in legal reasoning and argumentation are
amorphous.  For TAXMAN II, we have proposed in the past a Prototype
and Deformation model for these amorphous concepts.  In this model, a
concept is represented as a structured space of exemplars, that is as
a set of exemplars, structured by transformations and relationships
among them.  In this paper, the idea of representing a concept as a
structured space of exemplars is extended; suggesting that all
knowledge represented in a computer be organized as structured spaces
and subspaces.  Concepts are represented as spaces; concepts are also
members of spaces.  This duality is exploited to gain flexibility in
the representation, that is, changes to the structure can be effected
through computation.

%X The Concept Learning presented here emphasizes the building of a
transformation between an instance of a concept and another instance
which is distinguished as a prototype of the concept.  A recursive
partial matcher is used to pinpoint components of structural object
descriptions of the training instances for matching.  Three procedures
are described for inducing matches:  building simple analogies,
applying primitive transformations, and finding projections of the
instances into domains of knowledge relevant to the concept being
learned.  This research is experimental in nature and directed at
discovering flexible ways to define and represent concepts which are
amorphous and open-textured.

%A N.S. Sridharan
%I Rutgers University Department of Computer Science
%K AI01
%X The enterprise of developing knowledge-based systems, is currently
witnessing great growth in popularity.  The central unity of such
programs is that they interpret knowledge that is explicitly encoded
as @i[rules].  This paper is a statement of personal perspective by a
researcher interested in fundamental issues in the symbolic
representation and organization of knowledge.  The discussion covers
the nature of rules (Sec. 3), and methods of rule-handling (Sec. 4).
The paper concludes with a discussion of how most concepts we use are
open-textured and how they continually evolve with use (Sections
5,6,7).  While rule-based programming comes with certain clear
pay-offs, further fundamental advances in research is needed to extend
the scope of tasks that can be adequately represented in this fashion.

%D 10/84
%I Rutgers University Department of Computer Science
%K AA24 taxman tax AA04
%X One open problem in current artificial intelligence (AI) models of
learning and reasoning by analogy is: which aspects of the analogous
situations are relevant to the analogy, and which are irrelevant?  It
is currently recognized that analogy involves mapping some underlying
causal network of relations between situations [Winston 82], [Gentner
83], [Burstein 83a], [Carbonell 83].  However, most current models of
analogy provide the system with exactly the relevant relations,
tailor-made to each analogy to be performed.  As AI systems become more
complex, we will have to provide them with the capability of
automatically focusing on the relevant aspects of situations when
reasoning analogically.  These will have to be sifted from the large
amount of information used to represent complex, real-world
situations.
.sp 1
In order to study these general issues, we are examining a particular
case study of learning and reasoning by analogy: forming legal
concepts by legal reasoning from precedents.  This is studied within
the TAXMAN II project, which is investigating legal reasoning using AI
techniques [McCarty & Sridharan 82], [Nagel 83].
.sp 1
In this dissertation proposal, we will discuss the problem and a
proposed solution.  We examine legal reasoning from precedents within
the context of current AI models of analogy.  We then add a focusing
capability.  Current work on goal-directed learning [Mitchell 83a],
[Mitchell & Keller 83], and explanation-based learning [Dejong 83]
applies here: the explanation of how the precedent satisfies the
intent of the law (i.e. its goals, or purposes) helps to automatically
focus the reasoning on what is relevant.

the development of the Chinese language generator, SINO-MUMBLES.
This natural language generator takes as input a CD expression
and expresses its meaning in Mandarin Chinese.
The program is based on the English generator, MICRO-MUMBLE
and on an earlier version of the Chinese generator developed
in our project.

%X An extremely significant feature of any Natural Language (NL)
is that it is its own meta-language.
One can use a NL to talk about the NL itself.
One can use a NL to tutor a non-native speaker, or other poor
language user, in the use of the same NL.
We have been exploring methods of knowledge
representation and NL Understanding (NLU) which would allow an
Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to play the role of
poor language user in this setting.
The AI system would have to understand NL utterances about how
the NL is used, and improve its NLU abilities according to this
instruction.
It would be an NLU system for which the domain being discusses
in NL is the NL itself.

is presented.
Methods and algorithms for image preprocessing,
character recognition, and contextual postprocessing
are discussed and compared.
The objective of this study is to provide a background
in the state-of-the-art of this equipment
as the first element in a search for techniques
to significantly improve the capabilites of postal address recognition.

%T Belief representation and quasi-indicators
%A W. J. Rapaport
%D August 1984
%I SUNY Buffalo Computer Science
%K AI02
%X This thesis is a study in knowledge'' representation,
specifically, how to represent beliefs expressed by
sentences containing quasi-indicators.
An \fIindicator\fP is a personal or demonstrative pronoun
or adverb used to make a strictly demonstrative reference.
A \fIquasi-indicator\fP is an expression that occurs within
an intentional context and that represents a use of an indicator
by another speaker.
E.g., if John says, I am rich,'' then if \fIwe\fP say,
John believes that he himself is rich,'' our use of `he himself'
is quasi-indexical.
Quasi-indicators pose problems for natural-language
question-answering systems, since they cannot be
replaced by any co-referential noun phrases without changing
the meaning of the embedding sentence.
Therefore, the referent of the quasi-indicator must be represented
in such a way that no ivnalid co-referential claims are entailed.

The objections are found to miss the point,

%X This is a critical study of Karel Lambert's
\fIMeinong and the Principle of Independence.\fP
Alexius Meinong was a turn-of-the-century philosopher
and psychologist who played a role in the early development
of analytic philosophy, phenomenology, and Gestalt psychology.
His theory of objects has become of increasing relevance
to intensionally-based semantics and, hence, ought to be
of interest to AI researchers in the field of knowledge
representation.
Lambert's book explores the relevance of Meinong's theory
to free logics.

%T Recognition of off-line cursive handwriting:
A case of multi-level machine perception
%A R. M. Bo\o'z\(hc'inovi\o'c\(aa'
%D March 1985
%I SUNY Buffalo Computer Science
%K AI06
%X Cursive script recognition by computer (CSR)
is the problem of transforming language from
the form of cursive human handwriting to one of digital
text representation.
Off-line CSR involves elements of computer vision
at a low level of processing
andk those of language perception and understanding at
a higher level.
The problem is approached in this work
as a multi-level machine perception problem
in which an image of a cursive script word is transformed
through a hierarchy of representation levels.
Four distinct levels are employed,
based on descriptions that use pixels, chain codes, features
and letters, before the final
word level of representation is obtained.

%X The ERIK system is a computer program
that was developed to interpret ship reports for the
United States Coast Guard.
The system is now completed an installed in the Coast Guard's
AMVER Center on Governors Island.
It was running in a testing mode on a dedicated DEC VAX-11/730
system running VMS, from February to June 1985.
The final system will be running on a Symbolics Lisp Machine
in July 1985.
This report provides a brief description of the project, the system,
and user manuals.
The latter contains a detailed description of the theory
behind the system and the necessary
implementation and maintenance information.
