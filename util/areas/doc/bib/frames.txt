Reposted-by: emv@math.lsa.umich.edu (Edward Vielmetti)
 
 
The following is a list of functional, publicly available, frame
knowledge representation systems.  If you are aware of additional
such systems, please post them to this newsgroup or send them to
me by mail.  (Note that LOOM is another system in this category,
but it has not yet been officially released).
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                                THEO
 
        Frame-based representation, with Lisp and Prolog inference methods,
        and several user-invokable learning methods
 
Availability: For nonprofit research, with no right to redistribute
 
Fee: None
 
Licensing: Potential users must complete a licensing agreement form before
           the code is distributed
 
Hardware and Software Requirements: Commonlisp (runs in Lucid and Allegro).
        Graphical interface available running under X windows.

                                FRAMEKIT
 
        A Frame-Based Knowledge Representation System
        Common Lisp source code and 34pp User's Guide
 
Functionality: Frames, Slots, Facets, Views, Fillers; Demons;
               Breadth-First, Depth-First and Exhaustive
               Inheritance; User-Defined Inheritance; Default
               Values; Restrictions; Abstract Data-Typing (to
               permit any low-level storage scheme); Save
               Utility; and more
 
Availability: For non-profit research only, unlimited on-site use, with no
              right to re-distribute for profit or otherwise
 
Fee: None, if distributed for non-profit research (commercial use of
     FrameKit must be negotiated under separate terms)
 
Licensing: Potential users must complete a licensing agreement form before
           the code is distributed
 
Support: Strictly unofficial, although we do try to fix bugs that are
         reported to us; licensed users have access to major revisions
         of the system (Version 3.0 is planned for release later this year)
 
Hardware and Software Requirements: should run in any Common Lisp;
         instructions on how to compile for a particular CL are provided
 
Format: 5.5" DOS format floppy or 3.5" Mac disk free of charge; other
        formats can be arranged at nominal cost
