                             AI GENEALOGY
                     Building an AI family tree

More and more collections of bibliographic references to the
literatures of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer
science and other disciplines are becoming available over the Net.
Much of the work in free-text information retrieval (IR) is aimed at
developing INDEXING methods which would allow access to these
citations by appropriate keywords.  Another potential source of
information that could augment these  is "cultural" information
capturing some features of the SOCIAL relationships among authors in a
field.  Towards that purpose, we ask your help in developing a "family
tree" capturing one type of intellectual relationship, thesis
advising.  Historians and philosophers of science have pointed to the
importance of this channel of intellectual lineage generally, and some
preliminary studies have explored its role in AI in particular.

Some of you may recall an earlier version of this query sent out
several years ago.  From this call and other sources we have to date
collected information on approximately 2600 Masters and Ph.D. theses
nominally in the area of AI.  As a result, information about your
thesis may already be included in our database.  A small, early subset
of theses for which we have data are included in a report
below.  The entire list (about 170KB) is available for anonymous FTP at:

	cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/aigen.rpt

However, we know that our methods for collecting this data have not
been exhaustive, and so we are again sending this query out to
relevant places on the Net (news groups, etc.) in hopes of filling in
gaps.  In some cases we are missing  information (esp. thesis
abstracts) in the records of some individuals (these are denoted by
dashes in the reports).  In many more cases, we know we are missing
names entirely.

If you are not already included in our database, have a Masters or
Ph.D. and consider yourself a researcher in AI, we would like you to
send us some information about your thesis: its year, title, abstract,
where you got your degree, who your advisor and committee members
were.  In subsequent work, we also hope to analyze flow between
research institutions, and so we also ask where you have worked since
you completed your degree.  The specific questions are contained in a
brief questionnaire below, and this is followed by an example. If you
can snip this (soft copy) questionnaire, fill it in and send back to
me intact it will reduce the chance that we'll get any of your data
wrong and make our parsing task easier.

If you know some of these facts about your advisor (committee
members), and their advisors, etc., we would appreciate it if you
could send that information as well.  One of our goals is to trace the
genealogy of today's researchers back as far as possible, for example
to participants in the Dartmouth conference of 1956, as well as
connections to other disciplines. If you do have any of this
information, simply duplicate the questionnaire and fill in a separate
copy for each person.  Also, please forward this query to any of your
colleagues that may not see this mailing list.

Let me anticipate some concerns you may have.  First, no one would
suggest that AI research is published only in theses.  This
restriction is designed only to explore one notion of "intellectual
lineage" more precisely.  To the extent that this information about AI
authors proves useful, it should be possible to extrapolate from
theses to other publications by these same individuals.  Also, be
advised that this is very much a not-for-profit operation.  The
resulting information will remain a resource in the public domain and
available for FTP (and soon Gopher and WWW, etc.) access.

If you have any questions, or suggestions, please let me know. Thank
you for your help.

NAME:			Richard K. Belew	

Thesis year:		1986	

Thesis title:		Adaptive information retrieval: machine learning in associative networks

Thesis abstract - BEGIN

     One interesting issue in artificial intelligence (AI) currently is the
relative merits of, and relationship between, the "symbolic" and
"connectionist" approaches to intelligent systems building. The performance
of more traditional symbolic systems has been striking, but getting these
systems to learn truly new symbols has proven difficult. Recently, some
researchers have begun to explore a distinctly different type of
representation, similar in some respects to the nerve nets of several
decades past. In these massively parallel, connectionist models, symbols
arise implicitly, through the interactions of many simple and sub-symbolic
elements. One of the advantages of using such simple elements as building
blocks is that several learning algorithms work quite well. The range of
application for connectionist models has remained limited, however, and it
has been difficult to bridge the gap between this work and standard AI.
         The AIR system represents a connectionist approach to the problem
of free-text information retrieval (IR). Not only is this an increasingly
important type of data, but it provides an excellent demonstration of the
advantages of connectionist mechanisms, particularly adaptive mechanisms.
AIR's goal is to build an indexing structure that will retrieve documents
that are likely to be found relevant. Over time, by using users' browsing
patterns as an indication of approval, AIR comes to learn what the keywords
(symbols) mean so as use them to retrieve appropriate documents. AIR thus
attempts to bridge the gap between connectionist learning techniques and
symbolic knowledge representations.
         The work described was done in two phases. The first phase
concentrated on mapping the IR task into a connectionist network; it is
shown that IR is very amenable to this representation. The second, more
central phase of the research has shown that this network can also adapt.
AIR translates the browsing behaviors of its users into a feedback signal
used by a Hebbian-like local learning rule to change the weights on some
links. Experience with a series of alternative learning rules are reported,
and the results of experiments using human subjects to evaluate the results
of AIR's learning are presented.
