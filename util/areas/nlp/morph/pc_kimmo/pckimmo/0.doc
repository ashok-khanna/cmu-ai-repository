Summary:      Two-Level Processor for Morphological Analysis

Version:      1.0.8 (18-FEB-92)

Description: 

   PC-Kimmo is a new implementation of a program dubbed KIMMO after its
   inventor Kimmo Koskenniemi (see Koskenniemi 1983). The program is
   designed to generate (produce) and/or recognize (parse) words using a
   two-level model of word structure in which a word is represented as a
   correspondence between its lexical level form and its surface level
   form. PC-Kimmo includes descriptions for English, Finnish, 
   Japanese, Hebrew, Kasem, Tagalog, and Turkish. 

Requires:     C
