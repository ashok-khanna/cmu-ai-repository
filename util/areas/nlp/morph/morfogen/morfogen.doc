                            ABSTRACT

     This paper presents MORFOGEN, a morphological rule compiler
and dictionary interface tool.  MORFOGEN consists of a finite state
compiler, which converts inflectional and derivational paradigms
into a finite state machine, and a recognizer, which accepts
inflected forms as input and returns base forms (constrained by
inflection class information in the lexicon) as well as any
morphemes that matched during analysis.  MORFOGEN can handle
concatenative as well as non-concatenative morphology, and can be
used for inflecting as well as agglutinating languages.  Analyzers
using MORFOGEN have been written for English, French, Spanish,
Turkish, Japanese, Korean and Arabic; examples illustrating the
coverage of the system will be presented.


                         1. INTRODUCTION

     MORFOGEN is a finite state compiler, taking as input text
files containing inflectional and derivational paradigms and
compiling them into a finite state machine.  The paradigms are
tables specifying the allowable sequences of morphemes in the
language as well as the forms of the morphemes proper to each
inflectional class.  These paradigms are assigned unique names,
identifying the inflection classes in the language under analysis
and used when marking the words in the lexicon.
     MORFOGEN also includes a morphological analyzer, which
accesses the compiled rules to identify the morphemes in an
inflected string and suggest one (or several) base forms.  These
forms are then looked up in the lexicon using dictionary access
routines, which can be customized to interface with any on-line
dictionary.  If the lexicon contains inflectional class
information, that information can then be used to accept or reject
the analyses suggested by the analyzer.

     The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the
functionality of MORFOGEN, and to describe MORFOGEN's rule
formalism and its linguistic motivation.  The design of MORFOGEN's
high-level language and finite state compiler was driven by the
need for a morphological analysis tool able to express (and test)
linguistic phenomena clearly and efficiently, without sacrificing
expressive power to the requirements of the underlying
implementation.  Since we will not be describing the implementation
of the finite state automaton, but rather a high-level formalism
for the description of morphological systems, a direct comparison
with the two-level approach [Koskiennemi 1984; Antworth 1990] is
not within the purview of this paper.  We should point out,
however, that a central difference between two-level systems and
MORFOGEN lies in the basic units of description and their
organization.  Two-level rules are finite-state automata based on
the correspondences between surface forms and lexical (or
underlying) forms; the basic units of description in MORFOGEN rules
are abstract morpheme categories and their organization in
paradigms.  Some of the problems often mentioned in connection with
the two-level model, namely, the awkwardness and inefficiency of
expressing non-concatenative processes and the need to hand-compile
the finite state tables, have been addressed in the design of
MORFOGEN.1

     The paper is organized as follows.  Section 1 is the
introduction.  Section 2 presents MORFOGEN's approach to the
description of morphological systems, illustrating it with examples
from French and Turkish.  Section 3 describes and illustrates the
lower-level morphological operators used to parse word forms. 
Section 4 is a discussion of the priority levels implemented in
MORFOGEN, used in grouping paradigms in terms of their frequency in
the language. Section 5 briefly discusses the contribution of the
lexicon in the analysis process.  MORFOGEN applications and
platforms are presented in section 6.  Section 7 is a conclusion
and a brief discussion of future work in extending MORFOGEN's
functionality.


                       2. MORFOGEN DESIGN

     MORFOGEN rules encode morphotactic information, specifying
allowable sequences of morphemes, and allomorphic variation,
providing for the description of allomorphs and the distribution of
individual allomorphs in each inflectional class.  The units in a
MORFOGEN analysis are morpheme categories, the members of those
categories, and, on the lowest level, the descriptions of the
(orthographic) forms of those elements.  Even though MORFOGEN
descriptions make reference to morphemes and allomorphs, however,
in terms of their organization they reflect the insights of the
Word and Paradigm model of morphology [Matthews 1974]: MORFOGEN
rules are paradigms, or groups of tables identifying the forms
defining the inflectional patterns in a language.  Words belonging
to a given paradigm will inflect like the model for that paradigm
listed in the rule file; the paradigm name can be stored in the
lexicon to help the analyzer reject spurious analyses and to
constrain derivations.

     An important feature of MORFOGEN is that it allows an analysis
of the inflectional and derivational morphology of a language which
is independent of the identification of the actual portion(s) of
the inflected forms associated with a particular morpheme category.
Thus, the form 'children' can be analyzed either as
'child+ren(PLUR)' or simply as 'children(PLUR)'; however,
regardless of the process used to identify the base form, both
analyses will identify 'children' as 'child + PLURAL'.  Whether the
plural morpheme is identified with the characters 'ren' or whether
the entire form 'children' is analyzed as plural is, in a sense,
immaterial in the description of paradigms, especially in the case
of paradigms represented by very few members.  The actual
morphological operations used to identify the form of a morpheme
can be expressed without disturbing the overall description of the
morphological system of a language.

     The expression of such morphological operations is
accomplished by means of several specially defined operators which
can handle both concatenative and non-concatenative phenomena. 
These phenomena range from simple suffixation and prefixation to
operations involving discontinuous morphemes, infixation,
gemination, degemination, reduplication etc.  Morphological
operations can be assigned a morph name, and their distribution and
cooccurrence restrictions can be stated using that name.

     Finally, the content of morphemes can also be specified in the
MORFOGEN rule file; this information can then be used by a parser
and can help determine the syntactic or semantic function of the
inflected form.  Furthermore, the relative order in which morphemes
are identified will be reflected in the derivation history returned
by the analyzer, and will be available to the application within
which the analyzer is integrated; thus, the two possible
bracketings for a form like 'unmasked', namely, [un+[mask+ed]]
('not masked') and [[un+mask]+ed] 'unmask+past', will differ in the
relative nesting of the morphemes 'un' and 'ed'.


A Sample of French Morphology: Finite Verb Forms

     Consider the French verbal system, which needs to account for
a total of 45 finite forms and 5 non-finite forms.  The 45 finite
forms are traditionally organized in tables representing a combined
tense/mood category (cf. future indicative, present subjunctive
etc.), each table in turn containing forms representing the members
of a combined person/number category; the 5 non-finite forms (four
participial forms marked for gender and number, and the infinitive
form, identical to the dictionary form) also need to be recognized. 
The finite forms are typically analyzed as involving fused
morphemes, each encoding a constellation of linguistic categories
(tense, mood, person and number).  This organization is reflected
in the structure of verb conjugation tables in traditional French
textbooks.  Superordinate to this organization is the partitioning
of the French verbal system in inflectional classes or paradigms,
traditionally known as 'conjugations'.

     A MORFOGEN input file can be organized in a similar way. 
Partial descriptions for the CHANTER and the FINIR paradigms are
shown in Fig. 1.  Also included in Fig. 1 is the declaration
section, normally included at the head of the input file, and
identifying, among other things, the categories to be used in the
analysis.

     Each table in a paradigm is delimited by angle brackets, and
contains two kinds of information.  On the first line, it specifies
the categories of the morphemes being analyzed, the name of the
paradigm to which the table belongs, and whether the morpheme
analyzed can be the last morpheme identified during analysis (in
finite state machine terms, it indicates whether this table defines
a final state).  Each table references two morphemes, the root (or
inflecting morpheme), and the affix; the table will specify the
ways these morphemes combine.  The symbols used in the first line
of each table in Fig. 1 are interpreted as follows:

     VERB           the root category (declared as such)
     VERB-MORPH     the category of the affix attached to VERB and
                    analyzed in the current table

     CHANTER,
     FINIR          the names of the paradigms

     PRESENT,
     IMPARFAIT      additional information about the content of
                    the morphemes analyzed in each table

     *              indicates that this is an end state in the
                    finite state representation, that is, that
                    VERB-MORPH can be the last morpheme identified
                    during analysis

     Fig. 1: A sample of French verb morphology

     The first line of the main body in each table specifies the
operation required to derive the base form for the string under
analysis; the remaining lines specify the operations required to
identify the word forms in the table.  Each morpheme is identified
at the beginning of the line by means of an identifier, in this
case the French pronouns  'je' "I", 'tu' "you", 'il' "he", 'nous'
"we", 'vous' "you-pl" and 'ils' "they".  These are the names that
the analyzer will use when listing the morphemes that matched
during analysis.  If, as shown in the example, these names are also
mapped to strings like 1-SG (first singular), 2-PL (second plural)
etc. (under the symbol ALIASES), the analyzer will refer to the
morphemes by the latter symbols instead.

     The invariant portions of the stem ('chant' and 'fin' in the
example) are not interpreted literally: rather, these act as
placeholders for the stem of any verb marked as selecting for the
paradigm under analysis, and are used in the MORFOGEN input file to
improve legibility and to allow for more efficient development. 
The last character string on each line, however, separated from the
stem by a space, is interpreted literally: this is the actual form
of the suffix which will be stripped off the inflected form.  A
morpheme is successfully identified if the suffix (or the
description of a more complex operation) matches and successfully
removed from the string.

     The purpose of MORFOGEN's analyzer is to generate base forms,
or dictionary forms, for inflected strings.  To generate the base
form of a French verb, an infinitive affix needs to be added to the
stem ('er' and 'ir' for the CHANTER and FINIR paradigm,
respectively).  This operation is specified on the first line of
the main body of the table.  During analysis, naming a suffix in
this position is interpreted as an instruction to add that suffix
to the stem.

     Note that the actual forms of the suffixes used here (or, more
generally, the actual content of the morphological operations used
to parse an inflected word form) do not affect the linguistic
description of the French verb form.  Thus, one could analyze the
form 'finissent' as 'fini+ssent', and modify the tables
accordingly;  however, the analysis 'fin+issent' in effect
introduces context into the rule, thus ensuring that a form like
'cassent' would not be tried here.

     Based on these tables, a form like 'sonnons' "we-ring" will be
analyzed as the first person plural of the present indicative of
'sonner' "to ring"; the analyzer returns the following response:

     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
     þsonnons ->                          þ
     þ  sonner + 1-PL-PRESENT-IND         þ
     Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

     The morpheme matched is identified as 1-PL-PRESENT-IND,
combining the string '1-PL', the morpheme represented by its alias
'nous' in the table, and the morpheme name PRESENT-IND, specified
on the first line of the table.  This is in keeping with our
analysis, which treated these forms as containing a single fused
morpheme, encoding a complex set of features.  As will be shown
below, a parser can then use this information either indirectly, by
referencing a morpheme entry by that name stored in the lexicon, or
directly, by using it as an attribute name.

     
A Sample of French Morphology Continued: an Agglutinating Analysis
     
     The previous example presented a fused-morpheme analysis of
the finite verb forms in French; it would be possible, of course,
to analyze these forms synthetically, as involving the
agglutination of several morphemes.  This is the approach we will
use in the following analysis of French participles.  A similar
analysis will then be presented for Turkish, a certifiably
agglutinating language.

     The analysis of inflecting languages in MORFOGEN is actually
a limiting case of its formalism.  In the analysis of inflecting
languages, each table in the paradigm identifies a sequence of only
two morphemes, typically the root (or lexical category) and the
category of the affix attached to the root.  That this can be a
final state is indicated by the asterisk at the end of the table's
header line (see Fig. 1).

     Agglutination, on the other hand, typically involves several
layers of morphemes.  French participles, for instance, can be
analyzed either as consisting of the verb stem bearing a fused
morpheme encoding gender, number and verbal information, or as
bearing three separate, identifiable morphemes, one for each of
these categories.  Let us identify three morpheme categories,
GENDER, NUMBER and PARTICIPLE, each including the following
morphemes:

     GENDER -> MASC
     GENDER -> FEM

     NUMBER -> SING
     NUMBER -> PLUR

     PARTICIPLE -> PRES
     PARTICIPLE -> PAST

     The GENDER and NUMBER morphemes are independently motivated by
the analysis of French adjectives, lending support to this analysis
for French participles.


     The rule that combines these morphemes is:

     V -> VERB PARTICIPLE GENDER NUMBER

     In the MORFOGEN input file we will want to represent this
sequence of morphemes, and ensure that the correct forms for each
paradigm are selected.  Note that in this analysis, all three
morphemes are obligatory; the forms of the MASC(uline) and
SING(ular) morphemes will therefore, as we will see, need to be
represented by a zero morph.  (An analysis not requiring zero
morphs can also be written, represented by the following rule:

     V -> VERB PARTICIPLE (GENDER) (NUMBER)

     In this analysis, default GENDER and NUMBER features can be
unified into the lexical feature structure if GENDER or NUMBER were
not present in the lexical form; this can be accomplished if
MORFOGEN's analyzer is integrated into a unification-based parser,
for example.)

     The forms for the present and past participles of the CHANTER
and FINIR classes are shown in Fig. 2; the morphemes are separated
by a space, and zero morphs are shown by a 0 (zero):

     Fig. 2: Participles for the CHANTER and FINIR paradigms

     Since MORFOGEN tables express arcs between two morphemes, the
representation of the morphemes encoded in the participles will
require three tables, one for each of the following transitions;
the affix category is then linked to a table where it occupies the
position of the root category:

         VERB  PARTICIPLE‘ýÀ
     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã
     Áýý‘PARTICIPLE GENDER‘À
     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã
     Áýý‘GENDER NUMBER *  (* indicates a final state)

     Since all morphemes are obligatory, the analyzer will only be
allowed to consider the NUMBER morpheme as the final state; the
asterisk will be appended to that table header.

     This analysis is reflected in Fig. 3:

     These tables introduce several features of the MORFOGEN
formalism.  First, the identifier SETS in the declaration section
allows a set of morphemes to be referenced by a set name.  This
notation is useful when linking paradigm tables.  For instance, it
is not sufficient to say that the VERB PARTICIPLE table can be
linked to the PARTICIPLE GENDER table; we also need to specify
which PARTICIPLE morphemes can be followed by which forms of the
GENDER morpheme.  In effect, this establishes paradigms of
participle endings, defined in terms of the forms of the GENDER
morphemes that they select.  The participle ending paradigms are
referenced as a group by specifying the name of the set that
contains them (declared as PARTIC_ENDINGS) in the PARTICIPLE GENDER
table.  This notation allows us to collapse all PARTICIPLE GENDER
transitions in one table, expressing the fact that all participle
forms can be followed by the same class of GENDER morphemes.

     Secondly, note the expression %null().  This is an example of
MORFOGEN's morphological expression notation.  An allomorph can be
either a simple suffix or prefix, or it can be a complex operation,
in the form %NAME( operation ), where NAME is an optional
identifier assigned to the allomorph described by that operation. 
The notation %null() describes a zero morph; a null operation is
specified in parentheses. (For a brief description of the class of
MORFOGEN operators, see next section.)   The two gender morphemes,
null and e, are referenced by the set name COMMON-GENDER in the
GENDER NUMBER table.  Since there are probably other GENDER NUMBER
tables in the rule set, to account for the gender and number
morphemes in adjectival forms, specifying the set name COMMON-
GENDER on the table ensures that the PARTICIPLE GENDER table will
be linked to the correct GENDER NUMBER table.
                             
     This example illustrates the principles involved in
determining the legal sequences of morphemes in the MORFOGEN
formalism.  During analysis, a table representing the state B C
will be linked to a table representing the state A B only if the
forms in A B are mentioned in B C, either explicitly or by means of
a set name.  This principle is extended to include the paradigm
subcategorization information in the lexicon, and is used to accept
or reject base forms: the paradigm name explicitly mentioned in the
final table accessed prior to lookup must be present in the lexical
entry.  Schematically, the analysis of the form 'chantantes'
"sing+PRES-PART+FEM+PLUR" involves the following links (starting
from the bottom):

A Sample of Turkish Noun Morphology

     The final example involves the analysis of Turkish nouns
forms.  Turkish can be marked for case and number, and, optionally,
with a possessive marker.  Turkish also has vowel harmony: the form
of derivational and inflectional affixes is conditioned by the
vowel quality of the stem.  If we posit a HARMONY morpheme to
reflect vowel harmony information, we can describe the distribution
of the affix forms in terms of that morpheme (as well as in terms
of the stem, of course, to account for assimilation phenomena). 
The structure of the Turkish noun form can then be represented as:

          NOUN HARMONY (NUMBER) ( POSS ) CASE
     
     To simplify this presentation and avoid positing several
layers of zero morphs, we will concern ourselves only with forms
including an optional POSS and an obligatory CASE marker.  These
categories will have the following members:

     HARMONY -> öü  (front, rounded)
     HARMONY -> ei  (front, not rounded)
     HARMONY -> aI  (not front, not rounded)
     HARMONY -> ou  (not front, rounded) 

     POSS    -> 1-SG-POSS
     POSS    -> 2-SG-POSS
     ...

     CASE    -> ACC
     CASE    -> DAT
     ...
                    
     For example, the forms 'evime' "my+house+DAT", 'eve'
"house+DAT", 'atInI' "your+horse+ACC" and 'atI' "horse+ACC" are
analyzed as shown in Fig. 5:

        õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ

        þ   at    þ aI     þ       þ  I      þ
        þ  'horse'þ        þ       þ  ACC    þ
        ÁýýýýýýýýýÂýýýýýýýýÂýýýýýýýÂýýýýýýýýýã
                                              
        Fig. 5: Analysis of Turkish noun forms
          
     The analysis of these forms will require the following
transitions: 

       NOUN HARMONY ‘ýÀ
   õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã
   Èýý‘HARMONY CASE *
   þ 
   Áýý‘HARMONY POSS ‘ýÀ
    õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã
    Á‘ POSS CASE *

     The CASE morpheme can be the final morpheme identified during
analysis; this is indicated by the presence of the asterisk
following CASE.  POSS and CASE follow the HARMONY morpheme; their
forms, therefore, will be conditioned by that morpheme.

     The tables in Fig. 6 present a MORFOGEN analysis of these
forms.  Note that the HARMONY morpheme definition consists of a
sequence of operations intended to establish the quality of the
last stem vowel; these operations, or morphological expressions,
are enclosed in parentheses and is assigned a unique name (ei and
aI) (morphological expression operators are described in the next
section).  This holds for regular nouns; there is a class of nouns
borrowed from Arabic or Persian which do not conform to vowel
harmony; these would be marked in the lexicon, as involving an
idiosyncratic HARMONY morpheme.

     To ensure that the correct form of CASE follows the various
forms of POSS, there are two POSS paradigms: the first lists the
forms of CASE appropriate to the set of back unrounded possessive
morphemes (referenced by the set name, BACK-UNROUNDED-POSS); the
second is the paradigm of the front unrounded possessive morphemes
(FRONT-UNROUNDED-POSS).  A similar approach is implemented to
ensure that the correct forms of CASE or POSS follow the HARMONY
morpheme.  Since no set of HARMONY morphemes has been declared, the
actual HARMONY morpheme names are the paradigm names (see the
tables for HARMONY CASE and HARMONY POSS).

                   3. MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS

     In the previous section we introduced MORFOGEN's morphological
expression notation (cf. the zero morph, shown as %null(), ).  It
is possible to assign these operations a unique name, by which they
can be referenced when building paradigm tables for linked
morphemes.  This allows the abstraction of the actual operations
from the analysis of the structure of lexical forms in the
language, and at the same time allows the definition of operations
having as their domain the entire word form, as will be shown.

     Some operators take a string constant or variable as an
argument; others are used without arguments.  A variable can
contain the character C or V optionally followed by regular
expression operators (for example, "CVC", "C*VC*", or "C+VC+"). 
Currently, C and V are predefined symbols.

     - "string"     string is removed from the end of the word
     + "string"     string is added to the end of the word
     -| "string"    string is removed from the front of the word
     +| "string"    string is added to the front of the word
     : "string"     makes sure string matches end of the word (the
                    word remains unchanged)
     :| "string"    makes sure string matches beginning of the
                    word (the word remains unchanged)
     + &&           duplicates the final character of the word
     - &&           if the last two characters of a word are the
                    name, it removes the latter of the two
     -- "Z"         where Z is a sequence of the following:
                         C    1 consonant
                         C*   0 or more consonants
                         C+   1 or more consonants
                         V    1 vowel
                         V*   0 or more vowels
                         V+   1 or more vowels
                         ?    any character
                    vowels and consonants are any from the regular
                    DOS ASCII extended set; the given pattern is
                    matched at the end of the word, and the
                    matching string is removed and placed in a
                    save buffer
     ++             adds the string in the save buffer to the end
                    of the word
     %+ "Y"         where Y is a sequence of characters sprinkled
                    with periods for discontinuous infixation. 
                    For example, if Y is "me..e.h" and the word is
                    "ktb", the new word will be "mektebeh". 
                    Filling starts from the right side of the
                    word.
     %- "Y"         where Y is a sequence of characters sprinkled
                    with periods for discontinuous deletion.  For
                    example, if Y is "me..e.h" and the word is
                    "mektebeh", the new word will be "ktb".  Y
                    should match the end of the word.
     The following examples will illustrate the use of MORFOGEN
operators.  The operations are executed from left to right.

a. German past participles

     The analysis of German past participle forms may involve both
a prefix, normally 'ge', and a suffix, normally 't'.  The
dictionary form of German verbs is typically obtained by adding the
string 'en' to the form obtained after removing these affixes.  For
example, the past participle of 'leben' "to live" is 'gelebt',
analyzed as 'ge+leb+t'.  Fig. 7, part of the LEBEN paradigm,
accounts for these facts:

     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
     þ< VERB PARTICIPLE  LEBEN  *            þ
     þleb en                                 þ
     þpast-pple leb  %( -| "ge" - "t" )      þ
     þ>                                      þ
     Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

     Fig. 7:  Past participle form in the LEBEN paradigm

     The operation shown will remove the string "ge" from the front
of the word, and will remove the character "t" from the end of the
word.  Once the stem has been identified, the ending "en" will be
added to it to generate the base form, which will then be looked up
in the dictionary.  This operation is not given a name, since this
morpheme will not be used as the paradigm name in another table. 
Note, however, that it is the entire operation that defines the
discontinuous PARTICIPLE morpheme.

b. Umlautung of German plural nouns

     German nouns may umlaut the stem-final vowel nucleus when the
plural ending 'e' is added.  Thus, the plural of 'Baum' "tree" is
'Bäume'.  The rule for the formation of the nominative plural of
such nouns is show in Fig. 8:

     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
     þ < NOUN NUMBER-CASE BAUM PLURAL *              þ
     þ Baum                                          þ
     þ NOM   Baum %( - "e" -- "C*" - "äu" + "au" ++ )þ
     þ >                                             þ
     Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

     Fig. 8:  Umlautung in German nouns

     This operation will remove the final 'e', remove (and store in
the save buffer) any sequence of consonants, replace the sequence
"äu" with "au" (if a separate character is used for the umlaut,
this rule can simply remove it), and finally restore the string
stored in the save buffer.



c. Arabic past participles

     Arabic stems are three-character sequences (described as
'triliteral roots'); morphemes are discontinuous, consisting of
characters interleaved among the three root characters.  Thus, the
definite masculine nominative singular form of the past participle
of 'kataba' (the dictionary form of 'ktb'), "to read", is
'maktuwbu' (the root characters are boldfaced).  Fig. 9 presents an
analysis of this form using the %- operators, which removes the
interleaved characters, followed by %+, which introduces the
characters required to generate the dictionary form; the morpheme
is identified as DMSNPP (Definite Masculine Nominative Singular
Past Pasrticiple):

     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
     þ < VERB PARTICIPLE REGULAR *                    þ
     þ kataba                                         þ
     þ DMSNPP kataba   %( %- "ma.uw..u" %+ ".a.a.a" ) þ
     þ >                                              þ
     Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

     Fig. 9:  Analysis of Arabic part participles

d. Degemination in English

     This final example from English removes an 'ing' ending and
removes the second of a sequence of two identical characters to the
left of that ending:

     õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
     þ < VERB  V-INFL  CUT *           þ
     þ cut                             þ
     þ PROGR  cut %( - "ing" - && )    þ
     þ >                               þ
     Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã
  
     Fig. 10:  Degemination in English


               4. OPTIMIZING PARADIGM DESCRIPTIONS

     MORFOGEN paradigms can be grouped in different levels; earlier
levels are tried first, higher level rules being tried only if
earlier level analyses failed.  Levels are designated by integers
preceded by the pound sign (e.g, #1, #4 etc.)  This allows less
frequent paradigms, or alternate forms for the same morpheme in a
paradigm, to be assigned what amounts to a lower processing
priority.  Thus, the commonly used past tense form of 'burn',
'burned', can be described in level 1, while the more infrequent
form 'burnt' can be assigned to a later level.

     Fig. 11 shows the paradigms for verbs like 'walk' and for the
verb 'burn' defined on level 1; the less frequent form 'burnt' is
analyzed on level 2:

    õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
    þ (ROOT-CATEGORIES   (VERB))           þ
    þ (AFFIX-CATEGORIES  (V-INFL))         þ
    þ                                      þ
    þ # 1                                  þ
    þ                                      þ
    þ < VERB V-INFL  WALK *                þ
    þ walk                                 þ
    þ PROGR   walk ing                     þ
    þ 3RD-SG  walk s                       þ
    þ PAST    walk ed                      þ
    þ PPLE    walk ed                      þ
    þ >                                    þ
    þ                                      þ
    þ < VERB V-INFL  BURN  *               þ
    þ burn                                 þ
    þ PROGR  burn ing                      þ
    þ 3RD-SG burn s                        þ
    þ PAST   burn ed                       þ
    þ PPLE   burn ed                       þ
    þ >                                    þ
    þ                                      þ
    þ                                      þ
    þ # 2                                  þ
    þ < VERB V-INFL  BURN *                þ
    þ burn                                 þ
    þ PAST  burn t                         þ
    þ PPLE  burn t                         þ
    þ >                                    þ
    Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

   Fig. 11:  Specifying a paradigm on different levels

     It should be noted here that the compiler takes cross-
paradigmatic identity of forms into account: the compiled rules
will not redundantly contain an 'ed' PAST for BURN and an 'ed' PAST
for 'walk'. 

     
                   5. THE ROLE OF THE LEXICON

     In addition to identifying putative base forms for a given
inflected form, the analyzer will also look up these base forms in
a dictionary.  Analyses can then be rejected or accepted, if the
lexicon includes inflectional information; additionally, morphemes
can be entered in the lexicon and the information in those entries
can be useful in determining the syntactic and semantic content of
the form analyzed.

     For instance, if the word 'sing' is marked as belonging to the
inflectional class SING, the form 'singed' will not be analyzed as
'sing+PAST' but rather as 'singe+PAST'.  Similarly, the lexicon may
contain two entries for 'ring', one meaning 'to surround with a
ring' and marked as selecting the paradigm WALK, the other meaning
'to produce a ringing sound' and marked with the paradigm name
SING.  Note that, while a form like 'rung' will be analyzed as the
latter, a form like 'ringing' or 'rings' will produce two analyses.

     Specifying paradigms of derivational affixes is identical, in
principle, to specifying paradigms of inflectional affixes.  These
paradigms can be assigned unique names, which can be used to mark
words in the lexicon, alongside inflectional paradigms.  In this
manner, it is possible to constrain derivational analyses, ensuring
that 'belief' will be the correct deverbal noun for 'believe',
while 'retrieval' will be the correct form for the deverbal noun
derived from 'retrieve', and rejecting forms like 'believal' and
'retrief'.

     All morphemes, including derivational morphemes, are assigned
names; the analyzer returns these names along with the base form in
the event of a successful analysis.  The lexicon may contain
entries for these morphemes.  Each lexical entry for a morpheme can
be represented as a feature structure, which can then be used by a
unification-based parser to identify the morphosyntactic content of
the inflected form (Antworth 91, Dalrymple 87).  Derivational
morpheme categories also may be defined in the lexicon, and may
contribute their own feature structures to the representation of
the inflected form.  Thus, the analysis of a form like
'antidisestablishmentarianists' may identify the following
morphemes:

   õýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýÀ
   þ  antidisestablishmentarianists ->                          þ
   þ     establish + DIS + ANTI + MENT + ARIAN + IST + PLUR     þ
   Áýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýýã

     The parser will then determine that this form is a noun
derived from the verb 'establish', by virtue of the information in
the morpheme lexicon.  The role of the analyzer is limited to
specifying allowable sequences and forms of morphemes; the actual
content of the morphemes matched is properly represented in the
lexicon and can be used to constrain derivations.


                  6. PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS

     MORFOGEN is available on variety of platforms (SUN, PC, 386-
base UNIX/XENIX, and OS/2).  The compact size of its compiled rules
(50-60K) and its analysis routines allow its use in memory-resident
mode even in systems with limited resources.

     To date, MORFOGEN's analyzer has been used to interface with
several natural language processing systems, including a retrieval
system, several machine translation systems, an on-line dictionary
lookup system, and a proofreader (currently under development). 
Analyzers have been written for English, Spanish, French, Japanese,
Korean, Turkish and Arabic, with several other languages under
development.  Since MORFOGEN's analysis routines are also available
in source code form, they can be integrated in other applications,
allowing access to on-line dictionaries using any lexical
definition scheme.

     Describing the possible applications of two-level analyzers,
[Koskenniemi 1984] made the following comments:

     Systems dealing with many languages, such as machine
     translation systems, could benefit from the uniform language-
     independent formalism [of two-level models].  The accuracy of
     information retrieval systems can be enhanced by using [this]
     model for discarding hits which are not true inflected forms
     of the search key.  The algorithm could be also used for
     detecting spelling errors. (p. 181)
     
     We are happy to report that MORFOGEN has to date proved to be
at least as versatile as the two-level model, both in terms of its
descriptive power and in terms of its range of applications.


                          7. CONCLUSION

     The functionality and linguistic motivation of MORFOGEN, a
finite state morphological rule compiler and morphological analysis
tool, was presented.  Examples were adduced supporting our claim
that MORFOGEN allows the expression of linguistically sound
descriptions for a variety of languages, using a hybrid of the
morpheme/allomorph approach and the Word and Paradigm model of
morphological description.

     MORFOGEN's compiler and analyzer are a standalone version of
the morphological analysis routines of the ECS NLP/MT Toolkit.  The
morphological processor in that system performs both analysis and
generation; we are currently working on including a generation
capability in the standalone version.

     Finally, our work developing analyzers for additional
languages continues to suggest extensions to the list of MORFOGEN's
operators.
