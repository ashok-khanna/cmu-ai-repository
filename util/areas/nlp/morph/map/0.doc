Name:         MAP

Summary:      Cambridge/Edinburgh Morphological Analyzer and Dictionary System

Version:      3.1 (August 1992)

Description: 

   MAP lets the user create lexicons for English (and other languages)
   suitable for use in a natural language parsing systems. In addition
   to simple look up, the system includes a rule driven morphological
   analyzer.  Thus words to be held in the lexicon in stem and affix form
   (e.g. "move", and "ed", "ing"), and the morphological analyzer can
   segment given full words into their basic components (e.g. "moved" to
   "move ed" and "travelling" to "travel ing").  thus cutting down the
   number of required entries in the lexicon.  The work is done within
   the framework of general feature grammars and two-level morphology.

   MAP is a more powerful representation formalism than KIMMO
   two-level finite state transducers, which offer only finite state
   morphosyntax and finite state morphographemics.
