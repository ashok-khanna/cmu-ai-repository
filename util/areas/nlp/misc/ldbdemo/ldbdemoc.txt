The Linguistic DataBase (LDB) is a database program created by the TOSCA
corpus linguistics group at Nijmegen University for the storage and
exploration of syntactically analysed texts. It features a tree viewer
and an extensive query language.

The LDB program, together with a 130,000 word analysed corpus of modern English
(the Nijmegen corpus), is available free of charge to academic institutions and
for Hfl. 5000,- to others.

A tutorial and reference manual for the LDB can be found in the book:
  Linguistic Exploitation of Syntactic Databases
  Hans van Halteren and Theo van den Heuvel
  Rodopi, Amsterdam (1990)

The demonstration version of the LDB accompanying this information file
will run on any MSDOS machine with a drive C: with about 650K of free space.
No graphics card is required. The demo program is fully operational except for
the following limitations:
  - the program will run only from drive C:
  - in all analysis tree databases only the first 200 trees are accessible

The files LDBDEMOC.INF and LDBDEMOC.EXE can be copied and distributed
freely, providing they are kept together. Furthermore, no money may be
charged for distribution, except for the cost of distribution medium and
postage.

==============================================================================

To move the demo version to your machine:
  A) If you have received the distribution diskette, obtained the software
     through ftp (binary mode) or executed step B) below you have a program
     named LDBDEMOC.EXE. Move to the directory where this file is stored and
     type (while drive C: is available):
	 ldbdemoc -d c:\
     In case this does not yield the files described below, but instead
     the files DONOTRUN.EXE and RUNTHIS.BAT, you started with a special,
     safeguarded version of LDBDEMOC.EXE. This version is meant to prevent
     people who don't have LDBDEMOC.INF (or haven't read it) from accidentally
     removing existing files by executing LDBDEMOC.EXE without parameters.
     As you may already have guessed, you must now type
	 c:\runthis
  B) If you have obtained the software through LISTSERV you have the file
     named LDBDEMOC.UUE. You must use UUDECODE to translate this:
	 uudecode ldbdemoc.uue
     Now continue as described under A) above.

The result should be a directory C:\LDB with the following contents:
  LDB
    DAT
      ADEM01.ANA
      ADEM01.COR
      BW104.ANA
      BW104.COR
    DEMO
      ADEMLDB.DAT
      LADEMLDB.CMD
      LDBDEMO.BAT
      SADEMLDB.CMD
    INFO
      ANALYSES.INF
      LDBDEMOC.INF
    PROG
      ANSI.SYS
      BATCH.DEF
      DEFAULT.KWD
      DEMO.DEF
      INTER.DEF
      LDB.BAT
      LDBCREAT.BAT
      LDBINCL.BAT
      LDBPDEMO.EXE
      LDBPRCIN.EXE
      LDBPRCLD.EXE
      LDBPRCPR.EXE
      LDBPREP.BAT
      LDBPRGCR.EXE
    WORK
      LDB.DAT

The demo is operational if the system has been booted while:
  - CONFIG.SYS contains the line
	 DEVICE=ANSI.SYS
  - ANSI.SYS is present in the root directory of the boot disk

To run the demo (did you check your CONFIG.SYS?):
	 c:
	 cd \ldb\demo
	 ldbdemo

==============================================================================

Once you are familiar with the LDB you can also use it outside the demo
environment. For this, C:\LDB\PROG must be part of the search path. This can
be effected by placing the line
	 PATH=C:\LDB\PROG
in the file AUTOEXEC.BAT in the root directory of the boot disk. If there is
already a PATH command in AUTOEXEC.BAT append
	 ;C:\LDB\PROG
to this line.

To run the LDB:
	 c:
	 cd \ldb\work
	 ldb

When running the LDB in this fashion, your own work (such as exploration
schemes you stored in the database) will not disappear after you leave
the program. If you inadvertently delete the file LDB.DAT, you can create
a new one by copying the file ADEMLDB.DAT in the directory DEMO. In this case,
however, you do lose everything you may have stored yourself.
