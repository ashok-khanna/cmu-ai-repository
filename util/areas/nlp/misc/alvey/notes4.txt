There is a slight mismatch between grammar and lexicon in that some
nouns are classed as [GROUP +] in the lexicon (e.g. committee, jury,
audience etc.) but this category is not used by the grammar. In most
cases the noun has an ordinary entry as well, so parsing will not
usually fail. However, there are a few nouns (citizenry, committee,
jury) where the [GROUP +] entry is the only one and therefore no parse
will be found for these. The GDE usually warns about lexical items
which can match no rule but this warning has been suppressed by the
inclusion in the grammar of the dummy psrule GROUP in file npap. To
get the warnings back, simply delete this rule.
