                       WORDSURV, Version 2.4
                           28 April 1988


This README file has four sections: about the program, known bugs,
revisions to the documentation, and history of program updates.

ABOUT THE PROGRAM

WORDSURV is a program for analyzing word lists collected in a language
survey.  It is fully described in the book, WORDSURV: a program for
analyzing language survey word lists, by John Wimbish, published by
Summer Institute of Linguistics.  Copies (which include the latest
version of the software) can be ordered from:

     Academic Book Center
     Summer Institute of Linguistics
     7500 W. Camp Wisdom Rd.
     Dallas, TX  75236
     Phone: 214 709-2404

The cost is $11.15 ($8.92 for SIL members).  Specify 360K 5.25" format 
disk, or 720K 3.5".

Though we strongly recommend that you first read chapter 2 of the
book, which is a guided tour of the program, it is possible to get an
idea of the program by running it on the sample data files provided.  
Copy the release disk to a working disk.  Set your DOS current
directory to the one that holds the working copy of the program and
data files.  Type "wordsurv" and press Enter.  The 10 function keys
access the modules of the program; see the menu in the upper right
corner of the screen.  First try the CATALOG (F1) and DATABASE (F3)
modules.  These load the data files, and allow you to examine them.
Use the right arrow key to highlight each of the commands in the menu
at the bottom of the screen, and read the one line explanations that
appear on the bottom line.  Test the highlighted command by pressing
Enter, or by typing the first letter of the command name.  The 
SHARED module (F7) does lexicostatistic and phonostatistic analysis; 
the COMPASS module (F2) performs an approximation of the comparative 
method.  The Go command in these modules starts up the analysis.  
Press F10 to exit the program.


KNOWN BUGS

Version 2.4 contains one known bug.

  1.The documentation says that the backspace key is sensitive to insert 
     versus overlay mode.  Currently it has the overlay behavior in both 
     modes.


REVISIONS TO THE DOCUMENTATION

The following paragraphs are a supplement to the published
documentation.  They either correct errors in it, or describe new
features which have been implemented since the book was published.

  1.Last paragraph, page 75.
    -Replace the fifth sentence with:
      "The Phonemes and Items commands result in an extended menu which
      contains the familiar commands Next, Prev, and Choose. These allow
      the user to move through the lists of results.
    -Delete the seventh sentence.


HISTORY OF PROGRAM UPDATES

The program updates are listed below in chronological order of
versions, from latest to earliest.  For each version, the major fixes
or enhancements are listed.

  2.4   28-may-89  -Problems with Alt-key character assignment fixed. If you
                      are using a previous version, you may need to delete the
                      \altkey line in the WORDSURV.PM file in order to have
                      alt-key assignments saved properly in the settings.
                   -A bug in computing the Compass computation has been fixed.
                   -The Compass results have been collapsed into a single 
                      menu, with a larger display screen.

  2.3   28-dec-88  -Compass computation now conforms more closely to the
                      original Frantz function. 

  2.2   06-may-88  -Bug fixed in editor that didn't free memory on insert. 
                      This bug gradually ate memory and resulted in a program
                      crash after a half-hour or more of use.
                   -END in editor now goes to the end of written text.
                   -The memory check has been updated to faster routines.
                   -The assignable Alt-Keys module has been added.
                   -Bug fixed in editor with F1 key on bottom line
 
  2.11b 09-jan-88  -Fixed semantic/alph toggle display in output module.
                   -Fixed alphabetizing in database module
                   -Added message: # records while reading/writing dbase.
                   -dbase write now remembers to reposition database.
                   -Bug fixed in editor menu if bad input for F1 selection.
                   -Bug fixed in compass that displayed into window margin.
                   -Bug fixed in printing out matrices.
        

  2.11a 20-oct-87  -Removed error limiting the database to 100 records.
 
  2.11  20-jul-87  -editor menu rearranged (return <> abort).
                   -titles module: previous ---> prev.
                   -ANSI option removed (decided not to support for now, it
                     is too slow, and most computers are compatable with
                     the quicker direct memory writes).

  2.1   23-jun-87  counting module:
                     -count algorithm speeded up.
                     -PGDN & PDUP fixed.
                     -Shared Settings window added for clarity.
                     -Update phonetic DDs and suppress options added.
                   -TAB key added to editor.
                   -use languages displayed & changeable in titles module.

  2.0   18-may-87  Second programming (major revision). Includes:
                     -error in count routine fixed.
                     -all data is loaded and stored in memory.
                     -files are now ASCII, with SIL format markers. Version
                       1.0 files are no longer recognized by the program.

  1.0   27-jun-86  First programming
