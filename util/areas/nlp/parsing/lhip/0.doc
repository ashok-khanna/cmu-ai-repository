Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/lhip/

Name:         LHIP

Summary:      Left-Head-Corner Island Parser Compiler

Version:      1.1

Description: 

   LHIP is a left-head-corner island parser compiler. The system compiles
   grammar rules to Prolog code in much the same way as the Prolog DCG
   system does. The rules themselves are an extended version of the DCG
   rules, allowing optional constituents, negation, disjunction, the
   specification of adjacency, and the ability to mark multiple heads in
   a rule body. 

Requires:     Edinburgh style Prolog

Ports:        Known to work in Sicstus 0.6.
