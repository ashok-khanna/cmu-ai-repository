Version:      Pleuk 1.0; HPSG-PL 1.2.2 (12-MAY-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains the Pleuk Grammar Development System.   
   The following grammatical formalisms currently work with Pleuk:

      Cfg     A simple context-free grammar system, intended for
              demonstration purposes.

      HPSG-PL A system for developing HPSG-style grammars.

      Mike    A simple graph-based unification system, enhanced with
              additional operations for the treatment of free word order
              proposed by Mike Reape in various publications.

      SLE     A graph-based formalism enhanced with arbitrary relations in
              the manner of Johnson and Rosner (EACL, 1989) and Doerre and
              Eisele.  Delayed evaluation is used to compute infinite
              relations.  This system has been used for the development of
              several HPSG-style grammars.

      Term    A term-based unification grammar system, originally developed
              for the support of Unification Categorial Grammar (Zeevat,
              Klein and Calder).
