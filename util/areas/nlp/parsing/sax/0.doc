Name:         SAX

Summary:      Syntactic Analyzing Program

Version:      

Description: 

   SAX (Sequential Analyzer for syntaX and semantics) is a syntactic
   analyzer based on logic programming. SAX employs a bottom-up and
   breadth-first parsing algorithm. The SAX grammar rules are basically
   written in Definite Clause Grammar (DCG). The SAX grammar rules are
   translated into a parsing program written in Prolog.
