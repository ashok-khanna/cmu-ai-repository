<H2>PAPPI: A Principle-Based Parser</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">areas/nlp/parsing/pappi/</A>

<listing>
PAPPI is a Prolog-based natural language parser for theories in the
Principles-and-Parameters framework.  The PAPPI system includes:

   -  An X-Window system-based user interface to the underlying
Prolog-based parser.

   -  A sample implementation of classic GB-theory, based on theory
described in Lasnik and Uriagereka's textbook "A Course in GB
Syntax". The implementation also includes sets of example sentences
and sample parameterization for six languages. Currently, these are
English, Japanese, Dutch, French, Spanish and German. (This software
was recently demonstrated at COLING '94.)

PAPPI is a parser that is designed to be a high-level research tool
for experimenting with and learning about linguistic theory. This
release represents just one possible instantiation within the
Principles-and-Parameters framework. Users are encouraged to
experiment with and modify the sample principles.

The PAPPI system represents code written to support research work. It
is still very much under development.  Alternate theories (and more
sophisticated parsing models) will be made publically available at a
later stage. Upcoming releases may also support other platforms and
may not need Quintus Prolog.

This is free software developed at the NEC Research Institute, Inc.,
an institute for conducting long-term, fundamental research in
computer and physical sciences. Comments and suggestions for
improvement to the system will be gratefully accepted! The author
would like to also hear from those interested in extending the system.
The PAPPI project also welcomes unencumbered software contributions,
including (but not limited to) support for additional languages,
theory and debugging tools.
