Name:         PAPPI

Summary:      A Principle-Based Parser

Version:      2.0f (4-NOV-94)

Description: 

   PAPPI is a Prolog-based natural language parser for theories in the
   Principles-and-Parameters framework.  The PAPPI system includes:

      -  An X-Window system-based user interface to the underlying
	 Prolog-based parser. 

      -  A sample implementation of classic GB-theory, based on theory
	 described in Lasnik and Uriagereka's textbook "A Course in GB 
	 Syntax". The implementation also includes sets of example sentences 
	 and sample parameterization for six languages. Currently, these are 
	 English, Japanese, Dutch, French, Spanish and German. (This software 
	 was recently demonstrated at COLING '94.)

   PAPPI is a parser that is designed to be a high-level research tool
   for experimenting with and learning about linguistic theory. This
   release represents just one possible instantiation within the
   Principles-and-Parameters framework. Users are encouraged to
   experiment with and modify the sample principles.

   The PAPPI system represents code written to support research work. It
   is still very much under development.  Alternate theories (and more
   sophisticated parsing models) will be made publically available at a
   later stage. Upcoming releases may also support other platforms and
   may not need Quintus Prolog.

   This is free software developed at the NEC Research Institute, Inc.,
   an institute for conducting long-term, fundamental research in
   computer and physical sciences. Comments and suggestions for
   improvement to the system will be gratefully accepted! The author
   would like to also hear from those interested in extending the system.
   The PAPPI project also welcomes unencumbered software contributions,
   including (but not limited to) support for additional languages,
   theory and debugging tools.
