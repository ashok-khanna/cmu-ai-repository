Name:         AV Parser

Summary:      Unification-based parser.

Version:      20p2

Description: 

   The AV Parser is a ``unification-based'' parser (Shieber 1986)
   for natural language parsing with ``attribute-value'' based
   theories of grammar.

   It is intended for research and instructional purposes and has the
   following features 

     - graphical user interface, with tree and attribute-value
       matrix drawing routines, and the graphics can be "cut and paste"
       into other applications (e.g. word processors), supported by a
       scrolling-pict-view window class

     - completely customizable grammar specification language (an
       LALR(1) parser-generator is included)

     - several small sample grammars are included

   The graphics routines and the LALR(1) parser generator may be
   of independent interest to the MCL community.
