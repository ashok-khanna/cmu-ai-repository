Summary:      Trainable Part of Speech Tagger

Version:      1.13 (21-JUN-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains Eric Brill's trainable rule-based part of
   speech tagger. This tagger is based on transformation-based
   error-driven learning, a technique that has been effective in a number
   of natural language applications, including part of speech and word
   sense tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and syntactic parsing.
   The code includes a tokenizer for ASCII English, an English lexicon
   enduced from the Brown corpus, a table of mappings for word suffixes
   to likely ambiguity classes, and an HMM trained on the odd numbered
   sentences in the Brown corpus.

   For more information, see chapter 6 of Brill's thesis.
