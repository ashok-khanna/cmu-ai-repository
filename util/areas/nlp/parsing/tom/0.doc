Summary:      C implementation of the Tomita parsing algorithm

Version:      23-MAY-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Tom, a C implementation of the Tomita
   parsing algorithm. 

   The software constructs LR(0) parsing tables for arbitrary context
   free grammars, which you specify.  It then processes any input you
   give it and displays the resulting parse forest and optionally the
   parse stack as well.  The parse tables are also shown, if you
   requests it, since reference is made to them in the parse stack.

   One difference between this and Tomita's original algorithm is this
   algorithm has been modified into a dynamic programming algorithm,
   capable of handling all CFG's including cyclic grammars.
