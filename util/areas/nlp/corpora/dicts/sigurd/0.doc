   standardized dictionary. It contains most common American words,
   abbreviations, and hyphenations. It also contains (intentionally)
   many incorrect spellings.

   news services, Usenet news postings, existing dictionaries, name
   lists, company lists, UNIX man pages, project Gutenberg's E-texts,
   project Wordnet, and email.

   Please send words for inclusion in future dictionaries should be
   submitted to the author's email address or in the /pub/incoming/
