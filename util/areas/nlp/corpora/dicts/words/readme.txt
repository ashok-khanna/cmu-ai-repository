This is a list of over 100,000 English words transcribed orthographically.
I obtained it from The Interociter bulletin board in Dallas (214/258-1832).
The original read.me file said that the list came from Public Brand Software.
 
The original list contained 146,440 words, but I discovered that there were
thousands of duplicate words. I resorted the list and removed the duplicates
using the Unix utility uniq. The total number of words is now 109,582.
I have repackaged the list into four files (the original was five):
 
     File         Bytes    Words   Range
     ---------    ------   -----   -----
     words1.lst   315376   29839   A-D
     words2.lst   242484   23101   E-K
     words3.lst   325716   30439   L-R
     words4.lst   270759   26203   S-Z
                  ----------------
     Total       1154335  109582
 
This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and the
-s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs.  Thus the number of lexical stems repre-
sented in the list is considerably smaller than the total number of words.
