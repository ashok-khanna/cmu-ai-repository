Summary:      English Lexicon

Version:      6-SEP-91

Description: 

   This directory contains a list of over 100,000 English words
   transcribed orthographically. The list originally came from Public
   Brand Software.
 
   The original list contained 146,440 words, but contained thousands of
   duplicate words.  Evan Antworth resorted the list and removed the
   duplicates using the Unix utility uniq. The total number of words is
   now 109,582.
 
   This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs.  Thus the number of lexical stems
   represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total
   number of words.
