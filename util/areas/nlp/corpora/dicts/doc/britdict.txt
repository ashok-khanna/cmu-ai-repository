Subject: SUMMARY: British English Pronunciation Dictionaries

My apologies for a delayed response in sending out this summary.  The
standard disclaimers apply in that I'm no expert, but I've found the
information gathered very helpful so I hope you do too.

* The Longmans Pronouncing Dictionary is universally held as the best
  paper dictionary.  Longmans will sell the wordstar format typesetting tape
  to the pronouncing dictionary [or of their Dictionary of Contemporary
  English] for 750 pounds.  However, this may require substantial work to
  clean it up into a machine usable form.

  Contact: Mr. Stephen Crowdy, 
	   Longman Group UK Ltd., Longman House, Burnt Mill, Harlow, Essex.

* Two pronouncing dictionaries are available in computer usable form from
  the Oxford Text Archive: the "Daniel Jones English Pronouncing Dictionary"
  and the "The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary of Current English".
  Of the two, the latter has more followers.   I now have a copy of both of
  these and I am quite satisfied with them.

* CELEX, the Dutch Centre for Lexical Information, provides online access to
  a large relational database of lexical information for English, German and
  Dutch.  The English part of this database contains IPA phonemic
  transcriptions for 60,000 English wordforms.

* Although not strictly relevant to the original query on British English,
  two other databases are worth considering for special tasks.   The first is
  the 20,000 word NetTalk database which has the property that the phonemic
  and graphemic transcriptions are aligned so making it suitable for deriving
  letter to sound rules for synthesis.  The second is the TIMIT database which
  contains the sampled speech from 630 talkers saying 6300 sentences, each of
  which is labeled for phone and word boundaries.  A standard transcription
  for all of 6229 lexical entries is provided and a small amount of software
  allows comparison of pronunciation variation.
