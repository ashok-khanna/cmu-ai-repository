WHAT IS THE OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE?

The Oxford Text Archive is a facility provided by Oxford
University Computing Services. It has no connexion with Oxford
University Press or any other commercial organisation and
exists to serve the interests of the academic community by
providing archival and dissemination facilities for
electronic texts at low cost.

The Archive offers scholars long term storage and
maintenance of their electronic texts free of charge. It
manages non-commercial distribution of electronic texts and
information about them on behalf of its depositors.

WHAT TEXTS DOES IT CONTAIN?

The Archive contains electronic versions of literary
works by many major authors in Greek, Latin, English and a
dozen or more other languages. It contains collections and
corpora of unpublished materials prepared by field workers in
linguistics. It contains electronic versions of some standard
reference works. It has copies of texts and corpora prepared
by individual scholars and major research projects worldwide.
The total size of the Archive exceeds a gigabyte and there
are about a thousand titles in its catalogue.

WHERE CAN I GET A CATALOGUE?

The Catalogue is available in paper form by post from the address
below. New editions are published at least twice a year. It is
also available in electronic form, either as a formatted file 
for display at a terminal or in a tagged form using SGML. These
files are available from a number of different places under
various names...

(1) on the Oxford VAX Cluster as
     OX$DOC:TEXTARCHIVE.LIST and OX$DOC:TEXTARCHIVE.SGML 

(2) from various ListServers, e.g.  LISTSERV@BROWNVM 
    (send the mail message GET HUMANIST FILELIST for details)

(3) by anonymous FTP from Internet site black.ox.ac.uk 
    (129.67.1.165) in the directory /ota 
    
Wherever you are, you can send a note to ARCHIVE@VAX.OXFORD.AC.UK 
specifying which form you want. 
 
WHAT ARE THE TEXTS LIKE?

Because the texts come from so many different sources,
they are held in many different formats.  The texts also vary
greatly in their accuracy and the features which have been
encoded. Some have been proof read to a high standard, while
others may have come straight from an optical scanner, Some
have been extensively tagged with special purpose analytic
codes, and others simply designed to mimic the appearance of
the printed source. The Archive does not require texts to 
conform to any standard of formatting or accuracy.

HOW USABLE ARE THE TEXTS?

Most of the texts can be used with commonly available
text indexing and concordancing software, or can easily be
converted for that purpose. All texts are held as `plain
ASCII' files on magnetic tape, with no special formatting
codes. Documentation of the coding scheme used in each text
is supplied with it, wherever possible.

WHAT ABOUT COPYRIGHT?

Many of the texts in the Archive are subject to some form
of copyright restriction. The Archive's obligations to its
depositors generally restrict use of the texts to private
study and research. In some cases, depositors have also
authorised use of the texts in teaching.  In all cases, users
of the texts must agree not to use the texts commercially and
not to redistribute copies of them without consultation.

HOW DO I ACCESS THE TEXTS?

If you are a registered user of Oxford University Computing
Services (i.e. you have an account on OXFORD.VAX or black), just
send an e-mail message to the username ARCHIVE (on either 
machine) specifying which texts you want to use and for what
purpose.

If you are not a registered OUCS user, you can access only
texts in categories P, U and A as described further below. 

P category texts are in the public domain. No formality is
needed for these texts. They can be downloaded directly by
anonymous FTP, from black.ox.ac.uk or from other sites offering
this facility. At present, very few texts are in this category;
subject to agreement with our depositors we hope to increase the
number greatly in the future.

U and A texts are usually distributed on magnetic tape or
cartridge, though smaller texts can be sent on diskette. We will
also send copies to you via the network, if you send us the
required information (i.e. a secure account-name and password),
provided that this can be done with reasonable success. Where
copies are made on disk or tape, we make a small distribution
charge to cover media and postage which *must* be paid in
advance.

WHAT DO THE CODES IN THE CATALOGUE MEAN?

Each title in the list is preceded by a code made of of a
single letter indicating the availability of the text (U, A, P,
or X), in some cases followed by a star, a number identifying
the text and another single letter which gives some idea of
the size of the text.

Availability codes:   

   X	Available only to registered OUCS users. May not be copied 
   U	Freely available for scholarly use in private research.
   U*   Freely available for scholarly use in private research and also 
        for teaching purposes.
   A	Available for scholarly use, but only with written
        authorisation from the depositor.
   P    Public domain text. Available without formality to anyone.		

Size codes:    	A	Size less than 512 Kb
		B	Size between 512 Kb and 1 Mb
       		C	Size between 1 and 2 Mb
		D	Size between 2 and 5 Mb
		E	Size greater than 5 Mb

Depending on format, a standard 600 foot magnetic tape
will hold up to 50 texts of size category A. Most texts of
size code A will fit on a standard double density floppy
diskette; any text of size code A or B will fit on a standard
high density diskette.

WHAT DO I DO TO ORDER A COPY OF A TEXT?

Texts with availability code P may be downloaded directly,
either from our anonymous FTP server at black.ox.ac.uk
[129.67.1.165] or from other FTP servers on the InterNet. For
more information on using FTP, please contact your local
computing service.

For all other texts, you must complete and return the following
proforma. For texts with availability code U, the only
authorisation needed is your signature on the Order Form. For A
category texts, you must also provide written authorisation from
the depositor of the text; you should therefore ask us for
depositor details before ordering. All orders must be prepaid to
the account of Oxford University Computing Service, in sterling
or in US dollars. We cannot issue invoices, and any orders which
are not prepaid or not submitted on the standard order form will
be ignored.

=====        INTERNET ACCESS TO THE OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE          ===
====================================================================

As of this month, it is now possible to access machines here on JANET
directly from the InterNet. As of today, it is also (ipso facto)
possible directly to transfer files from a machine here to any other
machine on the InterNet, without specifying a password, filling in a
form, or any of that other stuff that some people find so difficult.

We'd like to start making some  -- not all -- of the Oxford Text
Archive's materials available in this way. There are two constraints.

Firstly, we cannot distribute material that does not belong to us. 
But there is a small quantity of material we can distribute, which 
we believe to be in the public domain. 

Secondly, we want to begin as we intend to go on: by distributing 
materials in TEI SGML only. But there is a small number of (mostly
very large) files which we will make available 'as is' to test the
procedure immediately. We'd appreciate your comments as to how
useful/reliable you've found the procedure.

Here's what you need to know:
 
>From a machine on the Internet, you should type   
   
   FTP black.ox.ac.uk           << N.B.  this is *not* VAX.OX.AC.UK! 

or, since we're not in many people's official name tables yet,  

    FTP 129.67.1.165  

When connected, you will see the prompt

   login:

to which you respond 
   
   ftp

(or anonymous). You will be asked to supply a password, in response
to which you should type your email address.

All text archive files are kept in the directory ota. Your first command
should therefore be
   cd ota

To see a list of the files and directories currently available, type

   ls

To download a copy of a file (say shortlist.sgml), type

  get textarchive.list

To log out, type
  
  bye


Unless otherwise stated, all files contain plain uncompressed character data 

The following files are currently available in the directory ota:

    textarchive.sgml     List of OTA Holdings as of 11 August 92 in SGML
    textarchive.list     Same list, no SGML tags
    textarchive.info     Text Archive Order form and general information

The following are currently available in the directory ota/dicts 
  
    710   Directory containing the three files making up 
          the 'computer-usable' dictionary derived from 
          OALDCE by Roger Mitton 

    1054  Directory containing  the MRC Psycholinguistic Database,
          complete with manuals and simple C programs for accessing
          the database

    1192  Directory containing CED Prolog Factbase, a set of prolog facts
          generated at Virginia Tech from the Collins English Dictionary

    info  File containing brief descriptive details of all machine
          readable dictionaries currently held in the Archive, with
          illustrative examples from each
 
The following files are currently available in the directory ota/french

    192tei.queneau  
          Raymond Queneau: Exercices de Style (1946) in TEI SGML
    192text.moliere
          Moliere: Dom Juan in TEI SGML

The following files are currently available in the directory ota/laws

    ec    Directory containing the text of the Treaty on European
          Union (the "Maastricht Treaty") of 1992

   usa    Directory containing a collection of US constitutional and
          legislative papers, polemics etc. 

The following files are currently available in the directory ota/tei

    vm2tar.Z           The public domain ARC SGML parser: complete
                       source code and documentation for UNIX systems.
                       (This version has been modified to support
                        TEI dtds; it is in compressed TAR format)


So, for example, to get the plain shortlist, you'd type
   
     ftp 129.67.1.165
     anonymous
     myname@mysite
     cd ota
     get textarchive.list
     bye

Internet access is regarded here as a privilege, not a right. Please
don't overuse it! And please remember that this is an experimental
facility, which may be withdrawn or substantially modified at any time
without notice.
