     Being a computer-readable version of the Roget's Thesaurus published
     in 1911.

This electronic version was prepared by MICRA, Inc. 1991.

This file is in MICROSOFT WORD (R)  (version 5) (for MS-DOS) format.
     (186,999 words including comments were counted by MS Word.)

  This file is an electronic version of the edition of Roget's Thesaurus
published in 1911 by the Crowell company.  The following differences will
be noted between this version and the original printed edition:
  (1)  the space-saving abbreviations in the original, using hyphens to
represent common prefixes or suffixes have been expanded into the full
words.
  (2) the side-by-side format for words and their opposites has been
abandoned.  Words are listed in order of their entry number.
  (3)  each main entry has a pound sign "#" in front of the number to
facilitate computerized search.
  (4) Greek words and phrases are transliterated and included between
brackets in the format <gr/hysteron proteron/gr>.
  (5)  where italics or bold type occurred in the original, italics or bold
are also used in the Microsoft Word format file.  In the plain ASCII file,
this formatting is lost.
  (6)  the approximate location of the bottom of each page in the original
1911 printed book is indicated by a comment of the form: <--  p.  23 -->.
If one searches for a particular page, note that there are two spaces
between the "p." and the page number.
  (7)  This file contains only the main body of the thesaurus.  Neither
outline nor index are contained here.  The outline ("plan of the
classification" and "Tabular Synopsis of Categories") are contained in a
separate file.
  (8)  Errors detectable by scanning with a spell checker have been
corrected.  Other errors are probably lurking here and there, especially
cases where a comma may be missing between related words or phrases..
  (9)  Comments are contained between angle bracket+two dashes, e.g.
     <-- this is a comment  -->.

     A version of this electronic thesaurus which has been supplemented to
include a few more modern words and phrases is available from MICRA, Inc.
or the Austin Code Works, Austin Texas.  The supplemented version is still
very much less complete than the latest editions of commercial thesauri,
and is probably not suitable for use as an adjunct to word-processing
programs, but it also has no proprietary claims attached to it by MICRA,
Inc.
     Future versions of this thesaurus are planned, which will be
reorganized somewhat in a hierarchical fashion to maximize the ability to
take advantage of inheritance from higher categories.  The objective is to
create a database of words organized by semantic categories, suitable for
use in natural-language understanding programs.  This is a very small-scale
project, which will not be competitive  with commercial efforts such as the
CYC project, or with major academic efforts, but is intended to provide a
resource for natural-language processing, which can be obtained
conveniently (and if redistributed, licensed inexpensively), by individuals
or small groups.  Anyone who is currently engaged in a similar project, or
knows of a similar effort, or would be willing to contribute to this
project, is encouraged to contact us, so that unnecessary duplication of
effort can be avoided.  We would also appreciate being notified of typos,
errors, or ommissions in either version.  Send inquiries or comments to:
