Hi,

Recently, I asked for references to language identification algorithms
on the CORPORA mailing list (for information how to subscribe: contact
corpora-request@uib.no). Below, you will find a summary of
the responses with only a few duplicates. Some papers are directly
available from the authors, which once again shows the power of the
network and the usefulness of this mailing list.

Ciao,

Here are a couple more references for you:

Ziegler, Douglas-Val. The Automatic Identification of Languages Using
Linguistics Recognition Signals.  SUNY Buffalo Ph.D. Dissertation,
1987.

Sibun, Penelope and A. Lawrence Spitz.  Language Determination:
Natural Language Processing from Scanned Document Images. To appear in
Proceedings of the Fourth Applied Natural Language Processing
Conference, Stuttgart, Germany, 1994.

The first paper has references for lots of other papers.

which describes a very successful method of language identification for

Dear Theo,

  Here is one reference I have,

  "N-Gram-Based Text Categorization", by William B. Cavnar and John M. Trenkle
in Symposium on Document Analysis and Information Retrieval in Las Vegas.
 
	The author also has software copy on line, the following is the direction to 
get it.

Cheers,
Paul

try:

 Sibun, Penelope and A. Lawrence Spitz.  Language Determination:
Natural Language Processing from Scanned Document Images. To appear in
Proceedings of the Fourth Applied Natural Language Processing
Conference, Stuttgart, Germany, October 1994.

there are many other papers referenced in the above; however, i don't
currently have a plain text version of the references to post.  i
could send a postscript or paper copy of our paper to anyone who wants
it.

I believe there are several well-established techniques.
I recommend the following papers:

Vitale, Tony, "An Algorithm for High Accuracy Name Pronunciation 
by Parametric Speech Synthesizer," Computational Linguistics,
Vol. 17, No. 3, 1991, p. 257-275.

This article describes some statistical and trigram techniques.
It contains a reference to a paper called "Language Identification
with Neural Networks" by Cole, Inouye, Muthasamy, and Gopalakrishnan,
in Proceedings, IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications,
Computers and Signal Processing, 1989. I haven't seen that paper.

Oshika, Machi, Evans, and Tom, Feb. 1988, "Computational Techniques for
Improved Name Search," Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Applied
Natural Language Conference, Austin, Texas, ACL, 203-210.

This article describes using an HMM model for the classification.

I seem to remember one other article called something like
"Triphone Analysis" which described a technique similar to
the trigram method except that it uses phonetic information too,
but I can't find the reference right now.

Good luck in your research.

Hi Theo,
This may be relevant:
Gavin Churcher, Judith Hayes, John Hughes, Stephen Johnson and Clive Souter,
 "Bigram and Trigram models for language identification and classification"
in L. Evett and T. Rose, eds, Computational Linguistics for Speech and
Handwriting
Recognition: Proceedings of the AISB'94 Workshop, University of Leeds,
UK, 1994.
In case you have difficulty getting hold of these Proceedings, I'll
ask Gavin to email you a postscript version of this paper

regards,
        eric

An article of interest might be:

Vitale, Tony (1991): "An Algorithm for High Accuracy Name Pronunciation by
  Parametric Speech Synthesizer", Computational Linguistics, Vol 17, No 3,
  pp. 257-276.

It describes a trigram approach to analyzing words (names in this case) to
determine their ethnic origin. The application is a speaking phone book.
