I had a paper in volume 19, number 1 of Computational Linguistics.
The first two issues of volume 19 were a gold mine for this sort of
work. 

here are a few other references: 

Communications of the ACM, 35(12), December 1992, was a special issue on
information filtering and retrieval.

One of the recent IEEE Expert issues (sorry, I don't remember which one it
was, but it was somewhere in 1993 or maybe 1992) was a special issue in
this area as well.
