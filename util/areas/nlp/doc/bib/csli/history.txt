lingbib.csli is based on the bibliography files of Andras Kornai
(kornai@csli.stanford.edu) with significant contributions by Bill
Poser (poser@csli), Paul Kiparsky (kiparsky@csli), and Gerald Gazdar
(geraldg%svga@cs.acl.ac.uk). The present version is 1.0 (as of July 
1992) -- updates will probably follow once or twice a year. If 
you have material you wish to be added to this database, please
send it to kornai@csli. Do this only if you are prepared to put 
these references (not the papers they refer to, just the "compilation 
copyright" of the references themselves!) under CSLI copyleft.
