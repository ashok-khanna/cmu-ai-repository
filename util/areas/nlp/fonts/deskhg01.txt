The installation of this package is quite simple.
1.    Copy the DESK.ALL printer file to the directory where
      your printer files are. Normally this is C:\WP51, but in
      the installation menu you could have entered another
      directory. 
2.    Backup any other *.ALL and *.PRS file, and remove any
      other *.ALL files from this directory.
3.    Copy the Softfont files to an appropriate directory, for
      example C:\WP51\FONTS.
4.    Start WordPerfect.
5.    Hit Shift-F7. Hit S (Select printer). Now you see a list
      of one or more printers, depending on your system.
6a.   If there is already a HP Deskjet 500 or HP Deskjet 510,
      hit 3 (edit). Continue at step 7.
6b.   Else hit 2 (additional printers). The HP Deskjet 500 and
      HP Deskjet 510 will show. Select the printer you have. WP
      prompts the filename of the printer file which is OK. 
7.    In the menu you are in now two items are important. At
      Item 6 fill in the directory where you put your
      softfonts, C:\WP51\FONTS, or whatever is the name of the
      directory. After you did this, choose item 4.
8.    Take the cursor down to the item Softfonts, end hit
      [Enter].
9.    Now you are in the list of font groups, these are Greek
      and Hebrew. Now you have to decide which fonts you want
      to use. Press enter, and put an asterix (*) in front of
      every font you want to use. Press F7, and go to the
      second font group, and repeat.
10.   Press F7 until you are back in the menu where you can
      select printers. Select the HP Deskjet 500 or HP Deskjet
      510, depending on what printer you have.

Before you can use the softfonts, you have to download them to
your printer. This can be done in WordPerfect, by choosing the
option 'Initialize Printer', in the Print menu.
Good luck.
