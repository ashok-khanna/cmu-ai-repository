Summary:      Miniature NLU programs from Schank and Riesbeck

Version:      13-JUL-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Common Lisp versions of the miniature
   natural language understanding programs from

      Roger C. Schank and Christopher K. Riesbeck, "Inside Computer
      Understanding" Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1981. 

   The distribution includes the SAM, ELI, and Tale-Spin miniatures. It
   will eventually include copies of the miniature versions of PAM, and
   POLITICS. 

   Also included in the distribution are:

      -  FOR Macro. This is the generalized iteration macro found, among
         other places, in Charniak's "Artificial Intelligence Programming"
         (1987).  An older version of it is used in the original
         versions of the mini programs.  

      -  CD Functions. This is a set of functions for manipulating and
         matching lisp representations of Conceptual Dependency formulas.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Tested in MCL, Ibuki CL, and AKCL.
