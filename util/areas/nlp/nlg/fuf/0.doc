Name:         FUF and SURGE

Summary:      NLG system based on Functional Unification Grammar

Version:      FUF 5.3 (24-APR-94); SURGE 1.2 (21-DEC-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains FUF and SURGE. FUF is a natural language
   generation system based on the formalism of functional unification
   grammars.  SURGE is a large grammar for FUF with a very good coverage
   of English syntax. SURGE is inspired by systemic grammars [Halliday
   1985] and HPSG. A user manual and numerous examples are included.
   Also included is a copy of Elhadad's thesis, which provides
   detailed information on the design of FUF and the only documentation
   available on the SURGE grammar.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Tested under Lucid CL, Allegro CL, MCL, Ibuki CL, and
              POPLOG CL.
