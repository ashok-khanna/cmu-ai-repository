                                -------
This distribution contains FUF 5.2 and SURGE 1.2, a system of natural
language generation based on the formalism of Functional Unification
Grammars. FUF 5.2 is written in Common Lisp.  The SURGE grammar has very
good coverage of English syntax and is inspired by systemic grammars
[Halliday 85] and HPSG.  Numerous examples are included.

USES:
- Research in text generation.
- Teaching of syntax and/or text generation [very successful].
- Front-end to text generation systems.
