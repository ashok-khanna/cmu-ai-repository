Package:      areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/

Name:         BELIEF

Summary:      Implementation of Paris and Vencovska's model of belief

Version:      18-MAR-94

Description:  

   Paris and Vencovska's paper provides a mathematical model of an
   agent's belief in an event by identifying it with his ability to
   imagine the event within the context of his previous experience.
   This approach leads to beliefs having properties different from
   those normally ascribed to it [1].

   The package includes a brief introduction, an implementation of
   Paris and Vencovska's model of belief and a description of the
   implementation.
