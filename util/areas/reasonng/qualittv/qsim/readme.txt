This ftp directory is for the public distribution of software developed
at the University of Texas under the direction of Ben Kuipers.  All
software in this directory is distributed under the copyright agreement
which is included in the file copyright.

Systems distributed in this directory:

  1.	QSIM

The latest release of QSIM is 

		qsim2.0.tar.Z.

Documentation regarding this release and its installation is included
in the release.  Once you have transferred this file to your machine,
you can unpack it by executing the following unix command:

		zcat beta.tar.Z | tar xvf -

This command will unpack the release file and create a directory hierarchy 
with the QSIM code.  Release notes and installation instructions are included
as postscript files in the documentation directory of the unpacked file.
In addition, we have included a working copy of the latest version of the
QSIM User's Manual.  It is also in the documentation directory and
is called q.ps.

The version called qsim-nodoc.tar.Z is the same version; however,
it does not include any documentation.  If you are 
downloading QSIM to the MacIntosh you may want to obtain this
version to reduce the time required to down load.  The documentation
can be obtained from a separate file called doc-qsim.tar.Z.


Thank you for you interest in QSIM and other software distributed by this
group.  If you have any questions or comments please sent them to
clancy@cs.utexas.edu.  If you would like to report a QSIM bug, then 
send mail to qsim-bugs@cs.utexas.edu.
