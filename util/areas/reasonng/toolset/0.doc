Summary:      OSU LAIR Generic Task Toolset

Version:      Fafner release 1.1-DoD

Description: 

   The Integrated Generic Task Toolset provides computational mechanisms
   especially suited for certain reasoning tasks which are typically
   encountered during the course of diagnosis, design, planning, and
   similar knowledge-based activities.  By directly supporting a set of
   basic reasoning tasks, the toolset provides building blocks out of
   which more complex reasoning systems can be built.  To support a
   particular reasoning task, the toolset provides a set of appropriate
   mechanisms, each with its own control strategies and characteristic
   ways of organizing and representing knowledge.  Thus, the toolset
   provides to the knowledge system builder an advantage over rules,
   logic, semantic nets, frames, and neural nets, similar to the
   advantage that higher-level languages provide over assembly language
   for the computer programmer.
