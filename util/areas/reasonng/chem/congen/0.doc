Summary:      Molecular Structure Elucidation in Organic Chemistry

Version:      

Description: 

   The DENDRAL Project was an application of computer science to the
   problem of molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry: the
   determination of the topological structure of organic compounds from
   indirect observations of these compounds with the empirical procedures
   of modern chemistry such as mass spectrometry.  This problem is
   important because the chemical and physical properties of compounds
   are determined not just by their constituent atoms, but by the
   arrangement of these atoms as well.

   "DENDRAL" is the name of the research project, which was conducted at
   Stanford University from 1965-1980, under Joshua Lederberg, Edward
   Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, and Carl Djerassi as principal
   investigators.  "DENDRAL" is also the name of the programs produced by
   the project.  DENDRAL originally stood for DENDRitic ALgorithm, a
   procedure for exhaustively and nonredundantly enumerating all the
   topologically distinct arrangements of any given set of atoms,
   consistent with the rules of chemical valence.

   The CONGEN program, the CONstrained GENerator, is one of the most
   important programs resulting from this research and embodies the
   general (acyclic and cyclic) generation algorithm in a system that
   allows a chemist to constrain its enumeration in a variety of ways.
   CONGEN is written in BCPL and is being made available to interested
   researchers as is, without any warranty or support.
