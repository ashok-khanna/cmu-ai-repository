Summary:      Knowledge Acquisition for Heuristic Classification Tasks

Version:      15-FEB-90

Description: 

   CL-PROTOS is a Common Lisp reconstruction of the research version of
   the Protos exemplar-based learning apprentice conceived by E. Ray
   Bareiss and Bruce W. Porter of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
   at The University of Texas at Austin.  Protos was originally developed
   as an experiment in knowledge acquisition for heuristic classification
   tasks.

   The original research version of Protos was written in Prolog.  This
   Common Lisp implementation is a reconstruction, not a Prolog-to-Lisp
   rewrite.  Thus, CL-Protos differs from the original Protos in several
   places, but mostly by intention.  Ray Bareiss had a consulting role in
   this reconstruction and suggested many of the changes.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        CL-Protos has been run on Symbolics, TI Explorer, and HP 9000.
