Name:         TimeGraph II (TG-II)

Summary:      Reasoning about Qualitative Temporal Information

Version:      1.0 (30-MAR-94)

Description: 

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point
   Algebra and of the Pointizable Interval Algebra (also called Simple
   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure. 

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Tested under Allegro CL 4.2 and Lucid CL 4.0.0.
