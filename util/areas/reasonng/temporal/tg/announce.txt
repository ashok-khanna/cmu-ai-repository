Subject: TimeGraph-II: temporal reasoning system available via FTP

                          TimeGraph-II
                          ------------

TimeGraph II (TG-II) is an efficient system for reasoning about 
temporal information which is now available to interested people 
via anonymous FTP to cs.rochester.edu: files tg-ii.readme and 
tg-ii-1.tar.gz in the directory ~ftp/pub/ai/knowledge-tools/ 

TG-II handles the set of the relations of the Point Algebra and of the
Pointizable Interval Algebra. Temporal relations are represented
through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
structure. TG-II is written in Common Lisp.

For a description of the theory underlying the system see:

"Efficient Temporal Reasoning through Timegraphs", 
Alfonso Gerevini and Lenhart Schubert, in Proceedings of IJCAI-93; 

"Temporal Reasoning in TimeGraph I-II", 
Alfonso Gerevini and Lenhart Schubert, SIGART Bulletin 4(3), 1993.

"Efficient Algorithms for Qualitative Reasoning about Time", 
Alfonso Gerevini and Lenhart Schubert, Artificial Intelligece, to
appear; currently available as IRST Technical Report 9307-44, IRST
38050 Povo, TN Italy; or Technical Report 496, Computer Science
Department, University of Rochester, 14627 Rochester, USA.

A new version of TG-II which includes an algorithm for managing
disjunctions of point relations is in preparation.  This extension
will allow the representation of a larger class of interval relations,
including in particular interval disjointness relations such as
"interval I before or after interval J".

Subject: TimeGraph-II: address for FTP changed

This message is intended to correct a previous announcement about
the availability of TimeGraph-II (TG-II). TG-II is available
via anonymous FTP to cs.rochester.edu: files tg-ii.readme and 
tg-ii-1.tar.gz in the directory pub/knowledge-tools
(note that in the previous announcement the directory was 
~ftp/pub/ai/knowledge-tools).

Subject: TimeGraph-II

Hello,

I would like to inform you that TimeGraph-II is now officially
available to interested people via anonymous FTP to cs.rochester.edu
(files tg-ii-1.tar.gz and tg-ii.readme in the directory 
pub/knowledge-tools).

Some of you also asked about TimeGraph-I. This system is not
officially available yet. For more information about TimeGraph-I 
you can contact schubert@cs.rochester.edu or teng@cs.rochester.edu.

If you intend to ftp TimeGraph-II, please inform us that 
you obtained a copy of the system by sending a message to
bug-tg2-request@cs.rochester.edu.

Thank you very much for your interest in TimeGraph-II!

Best Regards,
Alfonso Gerevini
