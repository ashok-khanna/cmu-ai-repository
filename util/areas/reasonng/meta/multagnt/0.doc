Summary:      Prolog simulation of multi-agent tutoring.

Version:      21-AUG-93

Description: 

   MULTAGNT is a simulation of error detection and identification in a
   small tutoring setting, consisting of a Teacher and a Learner. The
   objective of MULTAGNT is to show, how through meta-logical knowledge the
   Teacher can detect and identify deficiencies in the Learner's knowledge.

   The meta-logical knowledge used consists of predicates:                   

       - can_do, for determining what a theory of an agent can prove
       - cannot_do, for determining what a theory of an agent cannot
         prove
       - demo_trace_2, for determining the erroneous clause in an
         agent's theory

   which are used by an agent (usually the Teacher) to judge the
   knowledge of another agent (referred-to as Learner). Agent's are
   represented by sets of theories, where a theory is a set of clauses.

   In this setting the Teacher's knowledge is assumed to be correct.
   Thus, it can be used as reference knowledge, for generating question
   posed to the Learner and to judge the knowledge of the Learner.
