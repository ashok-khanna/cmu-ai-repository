Summary:      Goal-Oriented Deductive Query Processing and Non-Monotonic 
              Reasoning

Version:      4-NOV-93

Description: 

   The SLG system is a meta interpreter implementation of 
   goal-oriented deductive query processing and non-monotonic 
   reasoning with the following features:

      * goal-oriented query evaluation of normal logic programs 
        under the well-founded semantics by Van Gelder, Ross 
        and Schliph;

      * goal-oriented query evaluation of general logic programs 
        under the alternating fixpoint logic by Van Gelder, with 
        the restriction that the body of a clause has to be either
        an existential conjunction of literals or a universal 
        disjunction of literals.

      * goal-oriented query evaluation under the stable model semantics
        by Gelfond and Lifchitz.

      * integration with Prolog execution, and the use of Prolog syntax 
        for all programs.
