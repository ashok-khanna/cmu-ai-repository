   The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
   is a collection of test problems for Automated Theorem Proving systems
   (ATPs), using the clausal normal form of 1st order predicate logic.
   The TPTP aims to supply the ATP community with the following:

   1. A comprehensive list of the ATP test problems that are available
      today, in order to provide a simple and unambiguous reference
      mechanism.

   2. New generalized variants of those problems whose original
      presentation is hand-tailored towards a particular automated proof.

   3. The availability of these problems via FTP in a general-purpose
      format, together with a utility to convert the problems to existing
      ATP formats. (Currently the METEOR, MGTP, OTTER, PTTP, SETHEO, and 
      SPRFN formats are supported, and the utility can easily be extended 
      to produce any format required.)

   4. A comprehensive list of references and other interesting information
      on each problem. 

   5. General guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system evaluation.
