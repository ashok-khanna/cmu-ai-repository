Summary:      General theorem prover with domain-independent control
              of inference.

Version:      2.4 (24-JUN-94)

Description: 

   DTP (Don's Theorem Prover) is a sound and complete inference engine
   for first-order predicate calculus. It specializes in
   domain-independent control of inference.  The intended audience is
   those who need a reliable black box for drawing conclusions and
   answering queries from a knowledge base of full first-order axioms.
   It was created to incorporate all the necessary search control
   knowledge; the database itself need have no search control at all,
   either explicit or implicit (e.g. rule or conjunct ordering).  An
   ideal application, for example, would be as the back end to a machine
   learning program or mobile robot.  Such systems have a hard enough
   time just discovering true things about their worlds, much less
   figuring out how to arrange that knowledge in a computationally
   tractable way.  The philosophy in DTP is that the user need only be
   concerned about writing down true axioms, and all search control
   knowledge will be embedded in the inference engine.

   It includes some logic puzzle examples and a users manual.

Requires:     Common Lisp (CLtL2)

              Common Lisp.
