Name:         RCSTAT 

Summary:      Produces probability intervals from raw data using
              the Kyburg/Pollock method.

Version:      9-DEC-92

Description: 

   Few uncertainty reasoning programs go directly from raw observations
   to probabilities.  Statistical techniques in the Neyman-Pearson
   tradition are widely available, but require more expert intervention
   than is acceptable for some AI applications.  The main problem is
   identifying the reference class: as past instances are required to
   resemble the target more closely, the sample of such instances
   diminishes.  The logic for finding the right balance between relevance
   and sufficient sample size is not treated in mathematical statistics,
   but is treated in the philosophical foundations of probability.
