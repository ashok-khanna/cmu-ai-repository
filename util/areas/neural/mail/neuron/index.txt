GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIGEST

Internet: NEURON@psych.upenn.edu

   Neuron-Digest is a list (in digest form) dealing with all aspects of neural 
   networks (and any type of network or neuromorphic system), especially:

      NATURAL SYSTEMS                   Software Simulations
      Neurobiology                      Hardware
      Neuroscience                      Digital
      ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS                Analog
      Neural Networks                   Optical
      Algorithms                        Cellular Automatons

   Some key words which may stir up some further interest include:

      Hebbian Systems                   Widrow-Hoff Algorithm
      Perceptron                        Threshold Logic
      Holography                        Content Addressable Memories
      Lyapunov Stability Criterion      Navier-Stokes Equation
      Annealing                         Spin Glasses
      Locally Couples Systems           Globally Coupled Systems
      Dynamical Systems                 (Adaptive) Control Theory
      Back-Propagation                  Generalized Delta Rule
      Pattern Recognition               Vision Systems
      Parallel Distributed Processing   Connectionism

   Any contribution in these areas is accepted.  Any of the following are 
   reasonable:

      Abstracts                           Reviews
      Lab Descriptions                    Research Overviews
      Work Planned or in Progress         Half-Baked Ideas
      Conference Announcements            Conference Reports
      Bibliographies                      History Connectionism
      Puzzles and Unsolved Problems       Anecdotes, Jokes, and Poems
      Queries and Requests                Address Changes (Bindings)

   Archived files/messages will be available with anonymous ftp from the
   machine psych.upenn.edu (130.91.68.31) in the directory
   pub/Neuron-Digest. That directory contains back issues with the names
   vol-nn-no-mm (e.g., vol-3-no-02).  I'm also collecting simulation
   software in pub/Neuron-Software. Contributions are welcome.

   All requests to be added to or deleted from this list, problems,
   questions, etc., should be sent to neuron-request@psych.upenn.edu.

USING THE ARCHIVE

The Neuron Digest archive is available in two ways:
  - by anonymous FTP over the Internet
  - through a mail server 

ACCESS BY INTERNET FTP

The Psychology Department at the University of Pennsylvania, who are the
generous hosts for the Digest, has opened an Internet FTP host and made
the Archive available on it.

Those users who are lucky to have FTP access can open a connection to 
   psych.upenn.edu
and look in the directory pub/Neuron-Digest to find the archive. 

Please observe the normal etiquette for FTP, e.g. do not request huge
transfers in one block, try to avoid the normal U.S. East Coast 
working day (e.g., 1400-2200 GMT for the US archive).

ACCESS BY MAIL SERVER

The address of the server is:
   archive-server@psych.upenn.edu 

For information on how to use the mail server, mail a message containing
the word "help" at the beginning of the line to archive-server, and
instructions will be sent to you.


CONTENTS OF THE ARCHIVE

The Archive service contains each issue of the Digest, i.e.:
	vol-1-no-01	Volume 1, no. 1
	   ...		    ...
	vol-1-no-04	Volume 1 no. 4

	vol-2-no-01	Volume 2 no. 1
	   ...		    ...
	vol-2-no-28	Volume 2 no. 28

		and so on
		to present

Note that the issue number is always two digits long, i.e. it may require a
leading zero. In general, the volume number changes every 6 months but
was a bit erratic early on.  The complete list includes:

  Volume   Total issues
    1		4
    2		28
    3		13
    4		34
    5		55
    6		73
    7		45
    8		16
    9		43
   10		25
   11		50
   12		29
   13		(in process)

A file called digest.lastissue holds the header (issue number and date)
of the last digest to be sent. This may be of assistance if you think you
are missing an issue.

The files vol-1.summary, vol-2.summary, etc. contain the subject lines at
the top of each issue of the digest in volumes 1, 2, etc. Getting these
summary files may help you decide which issues you really want.
