Summary:      CMU's Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

Version:      Fall 1993

Description: 

   This directory contains some of the materials for CMU's graduate
   course 15-882A, "Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks". Some
   materials have been excluded due to copyright restrictions (e.g.,
   the PDP simulator).

   There is some software included with the handouts and syllabus:

      backprop.lisp     A direct implementation of the backpropagation
                        learning algorithm of Rumelhart, Hinton, and
                        Williams, for networks with a single hidden
                        layer. Written by David Touretzky, July 1991. 

      backprop.c        Backpropagation algorithm for training a
                        fully-connected MLP neural network with 1 layer
                        of hidden units. Ported to C from backprop.lisp by
                        Justin Boyan, 5-OCT-93.

      perceptron.lisp   A simple-minded simulator for two-input perceptrons.
                        Written by David Touretzky, January 1990.

      perceptron.c      A simple-minded simulator for 2 bool input to
                        1 bool output perceptrons. Ported to C from
                        perceptron.lisp by Justin Boyan, September 1993.

      qpole.c           Q-learning to solve the cart-pole problem.
                        Written by Rich Sutton, Chuck Anderson, and
                        Claude Sammut.
