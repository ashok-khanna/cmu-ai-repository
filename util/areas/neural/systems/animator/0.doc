Name:         HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR

Summary:      Graphical display of backpropagation training data and weights

Version:      1.01 (10-OCT-93)

Description: 

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.  

Requires:     Motif toolkit on an IBM RS6000 with X-Windows. C.
