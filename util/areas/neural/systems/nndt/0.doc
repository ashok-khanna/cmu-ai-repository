Summary:      A Neural Network Tool for Windows

Version:      0.98b

Description: 

   NNDT is a tool for neural network development which runs under MS
   Windows 3.1. The program includes models for multilayer feed-forward
   and recurrent networks and routines for graphical presentation of the
   results. Network training is carried out by the Levenberg-Marquardt
   method. The program is easy to use; all parameters are presented in
   setup windows and on-line help is available. The user-interface is
   developed with Microsoft Visual Basic while the network calculations
   and the training method are implemented in C and compiled to
   dynamic-link library (DLL) routines.
