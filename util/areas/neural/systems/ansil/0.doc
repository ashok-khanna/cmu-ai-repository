Summary:      Advanced Network Simulator in Lisp

Version:      2.02

Description: 

   ANSIL (Advanced Network Simulator in Lisp) is a neural network
   simulator written in Lisp. It simulates a kind of neural network
   known as a RAAM (Recursive Auto-Associative Memory). RAAMs are
   built using a matrix implementation of backpropagation. The Matrix
   Backprop Package (MBP), in turn, is built upon a nice set of linear
   algebra routines written in Lisp (and C).

Requires:     Common Lisp
