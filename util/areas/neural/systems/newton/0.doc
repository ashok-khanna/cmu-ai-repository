Summary:      Demonstrations of backpropagation neural networks.

Version:      12-NOV-90

Description: 

   This directory contains a few demonstration programs to illustrate
   backpropagation neural networks. These programs demonstrate two
   features that one rarely finds in backpropagation neural nets: 

      (1) Newton's Method is used to update weights and threshold biases,

      (2) Recurrence is allowed, with "persistent activations" (the
          activation level of cells in the neural net is preserved
          between steps).
