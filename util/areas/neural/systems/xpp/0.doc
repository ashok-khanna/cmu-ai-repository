Name:         XPP

Summary:      Analysis and Simulation of Dynamic and Probabilistic Phenomena

Version:      1.61 (11-OCT-93)

Description: 

   XPP is a system for the analysis and simulation of dynamic and
   probabilistic phenomena.  It solves differential equations, difference
   equations, delay equations, functional equations, iterative equations,
   boundary value problems, and stochastic equations, all combined with
   probabilistic models.  It evolved from a chapter written by Bard
   Ermentrout and John Rinzel on the qualitative theory of nerve
   membranes and eventually became a commercial product for MSDOS
   computers called PHASEPLANE.  It is now available for free as a
   program running under X11 and UNIX.

   A variety of numerical methods are employed so that the user
   can generally be sure that the solutions are accurate.  Examples include
   connectionist type neural nets, biophysical models, models with memory,
   and models of cells with random inputs or with random transitions.  

   A graphical interface using X Windows as well as numerous plotting
   options are provided. PostScript output is supported.  


Requires:     C, X11

Ports:        The software has been successfully compiled on
              DEC,HP,SUN,IBM,NEXT workstations as well as on a PC
              running Linux.
