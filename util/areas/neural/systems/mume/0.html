MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. 

MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
University Electrical Engineering.

Version:      0.5

Requires:     C.

Ports:        Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to
              port it to the Fujitsu VP2200 vector processor using the VCC
              vectorizing C compiler, HP 9000/700, SGI workstations, DEC
              Alphas, and PC DOS (with DJGCC).

Copying:      MUME is available to research institutions on a
              media/doc/postage cost arrangement after signing a
              license agreement. The license agreement is included in
              this directory, as are the DOS executables.
