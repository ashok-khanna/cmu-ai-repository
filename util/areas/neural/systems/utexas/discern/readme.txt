DISCERN software 5/7/93
=======================

Copyright (C) 1990 - 1993 Risto Miikkulainen

Eventually, this directory will contain complete training, testing, and
data generation programs, sample data files, and full documentation for
the DISCERN system. However, I don't have the full DISCERN software
cleaned up quite yet. The only package available is discern.tar.Z, which
is a pre-release version of the code and data for running the complete,
trained DISCERN system. I am planning to clean it up by early June 1993,
and at that time, I will also make the DISCERN training programs and
documentation available.  Stay tuned.

In case you don't know what DISCERN is, See

A short summary paper is available in this directory as integrated.ps.Z.

DISCERN software can be copied and distributed freely for educational
and research purposes, provided that the source is acknowledged in any
materials and reports that result from its use. It may not be used for
commercial purposes. I would appreciate if you would let me know of any
attempts to use this software. You can send questions, comments, bug
reports and suggestions to risto@cs.utexas.edu. However, the software is
provided as is, and I am under no obligation to maintain it. You should
know that this is software that I have used in my research, and I have
not made a great effort to clean it up for public use.
