Summary:      Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator

Version:      SNNS 3.1; Nessus 2.1; SNNS2C 2.1

Description: 

   SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) is a software simulator for
   neural networks on Unix workstations developed at the Institute for
   Parallel and Distributed High Performance Systems (IPVR) at the
   University of Stuttgart. The SNNS simulator contains a simulator kernel
   written in ANSI C and a 2D/3D graphical user interface running under
   X11R4/X11R5. 

   SNNS includes the following learning procedures: backpropagation
   (online, batch, with momentum and flat spot elimin., time delay),
   counterpropagation, quickprop, backpercolation 1, and generalized
   radial basis functions (RBF), RProp, recurrent ART-1, ART-2 and ARTMAP,
   Cascade Correlation and Recurrent Cascade Correlation, Dynamic LVQ,
   and Time delay networks (TDNN). (Elman networks and some other network
   paradigms have already been implemented but are scheduled for a later
   release.)

   NESSUS is a language for the description of neural networks. The
   Nessus compiler creates a network description that can be read by SNNS.

   SNNS2C is a tool to convert the description of a neural network
   from SNNS format to C source code. This code can then be linked to an
   existing program as a subroutine.

   SNNS is among the most popular neural network simulators.

Requires:     ANSI C, X11
