	This is the README file for the Nessus program paket.

Nessus is a language for the description of neural networks. The
associate compiler creates a network description that can be read by
SNNS. The file Nessus.tar.Z contains the following files:


NESSUSv2.1/compiler/sources/*  		All source files to construct
					the nessus compiler

NESSUSv2.1/compiler/bin/sun4/nessus	An already compiled program
					for a SUN4

NESSUSv2.1/compiler/docu/nessus.ps	A postscipt version of the
					manual.

NESSUSv2.1/compiler/docu/*.tex		The latex sources for the manual

NESSUSv2.1/compiler/examples/		A directory with some example
					nessus programs.

NESSUSv2.1/Readme			Nessus installation hints

NESSUSv2.1/configure			A configuration script to
					simplify the installation.



========================================================================
			IMPORTANT NOTICE !!!!
========================================================================

Nessus was a studend project in 1991. It was written to fit the
capabilities of SNNSv1.3 !! We took it from the server with the
introduction of SNNSv2.1, since we regarded it as being outdated. Now,
after some external inquiries we decided to make it available once again.

We performed some modifications so that nessus should now fit
SNNSv3.1. We don't, however, have the manpower for a complete full
support.  Especially we can not provide an English manual for the time
being (The first manual was also written in German)
