Subject: NNUTL101.ZIP - C source library/tutorial for neural networks

The NNUTILS package (NNUTL101.ZIP) is now available on SIMTEL mirror
sights, such as wuarchive.wustl.edu.  At wuarchive.wustl.edu it is under

/mirrors/msdos/neural-nets

NNUTL101.ZIP    C source library/tutorial for neural networks

NNUTL101 is a tutorial/source code package in C for making and
understanding C implementations of neural networks.  It comes in the
form of documentation and over-commented code, so the code itself forms
a kind of compilable manual.  A little should be known about neural nets
and C programming, but extensive knowledge or previous experience
implementing neural nets is not needed.

This is version 1.01 uploaded by the author.  It was ZIPped with pkzip
2.04g, and must be unzipped using the -d switch.
