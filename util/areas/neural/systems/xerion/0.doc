Package:      areas/neural/systems/xerion/

Name:         XERION

Summary:      Neural network simulator

Version:      3.1.147

Description: 

   XERION is a neural network simulator from Drew van Camp at the
   University of Toronto. It provides a library of routines for building
   networks and graphically displaying them.  Example simulators include
   Backpropagation, Recurrent Backpropagation, Boltzmann Machine, Mean
   Field Theory, Free Energy Manipulation, Kohonnen Net, and Hard and
   Soft Competitive Learning.

   See also SCIAM, a little program that contains the basic kernel which
   was published in the September 1992 issue of Scientific American.

Requires:     C, X Windows (X11R4, X11R5)

Ports:        Xerion runs on SGI Personal Iris, SGI 4d, Sun3 (SunOS),
              Sun4 (SunOS), DEC 5000 (Ultrix), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), 
              HP 730 (HP-UX 8.07)
