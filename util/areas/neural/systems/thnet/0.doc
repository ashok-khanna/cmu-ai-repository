Summary:      THinkNet connectionist software

Version:      1.1 September 1988 (12-MAR-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains the THNET (THinkNet) connectionist software
   package, including ACME, ARCS, and ECHO. It is a set of Common Lisp
   programs for modeling high-level cognitive operations using
   connectionist networks.  Its major components are:

      1. common modules for running and displaying networks;

      2. ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine), a program
         that creates networks for analogical mapping;

      3. ECHO (Explanatory Coherence Model), a program that creates networks
         for evaluating explanatory hypotheses; and

      4. ARCS (Analogical Retrieval by Constraint Satisfaction), a program
         to model analogical retrieval.
