Package:      areas/neural/systems/flight/

Name:         Flight

Summary:      A neural network that learns to fly.

Version:      29-MAR-94

Description: 
   
   The Real Time Recurrent Learning Algorithm was used to train a
   multi-layer, feed-forward Artificial Neural Network controller to
   perform the function of a Flight Test Maneuver Autopilot for a High
   Performance Fighter Aircraft flight simulator.  The flight simulator
   was used to train an Artificial Neural Controller to fly a 2g
   coordinated turn at Mach 1 and 20000 feet.
