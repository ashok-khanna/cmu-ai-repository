Name:         RNS

Summary:      Recurrent Network Simulator

Version:      1.6b (5-MAR-94)

Description: 

   RNS (Recurrent Network Simulator) is a simulator for recurrent neural
   networks. Regular neural networks are also supported. The program uses
   a derivative of the back-propagation algorithm, but also includes
   other (not that well tested) algorithms.

   Features include

     -  freely choosable connections, no restrictions besides memory
        or CPU constraints

     -  delayed links for recurrent networks

     -  fixed values or thresholds can be specified for weights

     -  (recurrent) back-propagation, Hebb, differential Hebb, simulated
        annealing and more  

     -  patterns can be specified with bits, floats, characters, numbers, and
        random bit patterns with Hamming distances can be chosen for you

     -  user definable error functions

     -  output results can be used without modification as input

Requires:     C

Ports:        IBM PCs and Sun Workstations (SunOS 4.x)
