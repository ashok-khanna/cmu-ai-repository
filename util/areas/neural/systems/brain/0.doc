Name:         THE BRAIN

Summary:      Neural Network (Backpropagation) Simulator for MSDOS

Version:      1.2 (21-MAR-94)

Description: 

   THE BRAIN is a neural network (backpropagation) simulator for MSDOS
   systems. It is simple enough to be used by non-technical people,
   yet sophisticated enough for serious research work. 

   Examples include recognition of numerals (1, 2, and 3), AND, and XOR.

Requires:     MSDOS
