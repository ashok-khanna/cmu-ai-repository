Summary:      Implementation of ART-2 Neural Networks for NeXTStep

Version:      1.1 (12-AUG-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains a NeXTStep application for simulating an
   ART-2 network with a modification for distributed classification.
   Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks, as proposed by Carpenter
   and Grossberg, form clusters and are trained without supervision.
