Summary:      Simulation of ART-1 Neural Networks

Version:      ART-1 (18-MAY-91)

Description: 

   This directory contains a simulation of ART-1 Neural Networks.
   Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) networks, as proposed by Carpenter
   and Grossberg, form clusters and are trained without supervision.
