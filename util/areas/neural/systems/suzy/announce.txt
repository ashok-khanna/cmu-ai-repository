Dear all,

	Suzy is a simple neural net classifier system for PCs written in
C++ and Turbo Vision. RBFs are used to implement the classifier system with
a class-based algorithm being applied to find the centres and radii of the
RBF units. The program is not intended for any serious applications and is
quite slow (and probably) a bit buggy and unreliable. Still, I hope it is
of interest to some people. Please mail me (tgrove@psycho.fme.vutbr.cz)
with any comments.

Suzy 1.0 can be found at:

rhino.cis.vutbr.cz (147.229.3.10) in pub/software/ai/suzy.tar.Z

Full source (in Borland C++ 3.0 and Turbo Vision 2.0) are included along
with some documentation and example data files (xor problem, two spirals
and simple visual pattern recognition)

Tom Grove
