Summary:      Neural Network Classifier System for PCs

Version:      1.0 (11-OCT-93)

Description: 

   SUZY is a simple neural net classifier system for PCs written in C++
   and Turbo Vision. RBFs (Radial Basis Functions) are used to implement
   the classifier system with a class-based algorithm being applied to
   find the centres and radii of the RBS units. The program is not
   intended for any serious applications and is quite slow, but may be of
   interest to some people.

Requires:     C++, Turbo Vision, IBM PC.
