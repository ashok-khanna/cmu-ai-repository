Package:      areas/neural/systems/nevprop/

Name:         NevProp

Summary:      General purpose backpropagation in C.

Version:      1.16 (13-JUL-93)

Description: 

   NevProp is a C implementation of general purpose backpropagation
   software, based on Quickprop 1.0 by Scott Fahlman, as translated from
   Common Lisp into C by Terry Regier.  The quickprop algorithm itself
   has not changed substantially, but it now includes options to force
   gradient descent (per-epoch or per-pattern), generalization & stopped
   training, c index, and interface enhancements.

   Questions and comments regarding the Quickprop algorithm itself should
   be directed to Scott Fahlman at sef+@cs.cmu.edu. Issues pertaining
   to NevProp code or functionality itself should be directed to the authors.

Requires:     C

Ports:        It runs on Unix, Macintosh, and DOS.
