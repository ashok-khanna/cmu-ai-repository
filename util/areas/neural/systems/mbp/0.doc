Summary:      Matrix Backpropagation Package

Version:      1.1 (23-NOV-93)

Description: 

   MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is an efficient implementation of the
   back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.  The
   algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
   descent.  All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
   and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
   peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
   caches.  On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x speed-up
   can be measured respect to conventional implementations.
