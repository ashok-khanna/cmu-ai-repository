Description: 

   NeuDL (Neural-Network Description Language) is a prototype of a
   description language for the design, training, and operation of neural
   networks. 

   NeuDL is currently limited to the backpropagation neural-network
   model, but offers a great deal of flexibility.  For example, the user
   can explicitly specify the connections between nodes and can create or
   destroy connections dynamically as training progresses.

   NeuDL is an interpreted language resembling C or C++.  A NeuDL program
   can be run in interpreted mode or it can be automatically translated
   into C++ which can be compiled and then executed.  The NeuDL
   interpreter is written in C++ and can be easly extended with new
   instructions.
