Summary:      Biophysically-Based Compartmental Simulator 

Version:      7-JUL-94

Description: 

   Neuronc is a general-purpose computer language somewhat
   like C that has special features for simulating large neural 
   circuits using compartments.  It allows creating large arrays and
   uses an iterative difference equation solver so that virtually
   any network geometry may be specified (e.g. geometry is not
   limited to "tree" structure, and may include loops).

   Since NeuronC is primarily a language it does not contain a
   complete interactive pull-down menu system for describing and
   running a simulation.  However, there is a complete graphics
   facility for displaying on standard devices such as X11,
   PostScript, and VGA.  NeuronC also produces ray-traced 
   scenes for rendering with the POVRAY simulator.

   The "NeuronC" simulator was originally designed for vision
   experiments on large neural circuits. It includes a 2D light stimulus
   (with optical blur and photon noise) and photoreceptor models complete
   with spectral sensitivities and time-responses.  A flexible set of
   synapse and membrane channel models is also included, including HH,
   sequential-state, and calcium-dependent versions.  Any network
   geometry can be simulated (including electrical loops) and a virtually
   unlimited number of voltage- clamp/current clamp and recording sites
   may be specified and plotted.
