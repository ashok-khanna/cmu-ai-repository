Name:         NN-Simulator

Summary:      Flexible and User-Friendly Neural Network Simulator

Version:      26-JUN-93

Description: 

   The simulate program is a user-friendly and flexible neural network
   simulator.  It is designed to handle the simulation of associative
   learning style networks, such as the LMS (aka Rescorla-Wagner)
   learning procedure and Backpropagation.  Multiple interacting networks
   can be simulated in parallel, with their behavior and interactions
   specified by a simple command language.

   Some of the more useful features of the simulator include:

      -  Simulation weights can be saved, and later used to initialize the 
         weights of a new simulation.

      -  Multilayer networks with arbitrary interconnectivity can be
         created. 

      -  Quickprop, a faster version of backpropagation is supported.

      -  Network behavior on each cycle in the simulation can be
         specified. 

      -  The output of the simulation on each cycle can be specified.

   The example network files include:

      -  ENCODER. Simulation files for a 10-5-10 encoder (described in
         (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986 v.1).  Demonstrates a simple
         backpropagation network.

      -  HINTON. Simulation files for Hinton's "family tree problem"
         (Hinton, 1986).  This demonstrates a more sophisticated
         example of backpropagation: the network is six layers instead of 3.
         Includes both backprop and quickprop versions of the network.

      -  SHANKS. Simulation files for some simple linear associative
         networks (discussed in Shanks, 1991).
