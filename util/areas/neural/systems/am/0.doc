Package:      areas/neural/systems/am/

Name:         Aspirin/MIGRAINES

Summary:      Neural Network Simulator (Backpropagation Networks)

Version:      6.0 (24-AUG-93)

Description: 

   Aspirin/MIGRAINES is a neural network simulator available free from
   the MITRE Corporation. It contains a neural network simulation code
   generator which generates high performance C code implementations for
   backpropagation networks written in the Aspirin network description
   language.  MIGRAINES is an interface for exporting data from the
   neural networks to visualization tools such as Gnuplot3, Matlab,
   Mathematica, and Xgobi.

   Many examples are included, such as an implementation of NETtalk.
   Also included are some network analysis tools.

Requires:     ANSI C

Ports:        It runs on Apollo, Convex, Cray, DecStation, HP, IBM RS/6000,
              Intel 486/386 (Unix System V), NeXT, News, Silicon
              Graphics Iris, Sun3, Sun4, Mercury i860 (40MHz)
              Coprocessors, Meiko Computing Surface w/i860 (40MHz)
              Nodes, Skystation i860 (40MHz) Coprocessors, and iWarp Cells.
