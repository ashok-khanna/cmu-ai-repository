Questions concerning "Resources for Artificial Neural Network Research, Study,
   and Play":

Q: Why isn't my book/tutorial/journal/newsletter/etc. listed?

A: You probably have not sent a machine readable description to Wesley
   Elsberry yet.  Send email, dial-up the CNS BBS and leave a message, or
   send a floppy diskette.  I try to make the list as complete as possible,
   and update regularly, but, contrary to popular opinion, I'm not
   clairvoyant.

Q: Why is the description of my book/tutorial/journal/newsletter/etc. not
   anywhere near accurate?

A: Because I'm fallible.  Please correct those glitches by sending me updated
   or correct information.

Q: How can I get my demo program/simulation/tutorial/text added to the CNS BBS
   archives?

A: Again, send your contribution via email (compress and uuencode, please),
   floppy diskette, or upload directly to CNS.

Q: How can I get the latest version of RESRC*.TXT?

A: The latest version is always available for download from CNS BBS.
