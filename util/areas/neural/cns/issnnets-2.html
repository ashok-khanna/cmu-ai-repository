           Hiring New College Graduates: One Employer's Perspective
                            by Patrick K. Simpson**

 Embarking  upon  a career   that will apply  all  the wonderful and important
 things  that  have been learned during  your  education is  both exciting and
 frightening. The excitement  comes  from finally getting  paid to do what you
 have  so diligently worked toward for  several  years. The fright comes  from
 what you do not know.  You are probably asking  yourself, What is an employer
 looking for in a candidate employee? How  can  I optimally present  myself so
 that I am seen for the valuable person that I am? Below  are some suggestions
 and  hints  about things that  I  look for in  a  candidate employee.  I have
 broken the discussion into two parts;  the resume and  the interview.  Please
 keep in mind, this is only one man's opinion.
                                      
                                 THE RESUME
                                 ----------
 A person's  resume  is  their life-story on a single  sheet of paper.  When I
 look at a resume, I typically scan  it quickly  -  maybe 30 seconds. If I see
 things of  interest, I will  study  it further.   For this reason, it is very
 important  to  have  key information readily  accessible.   There are several
 things that I look for when I review a candidates resume.
                                      
 (1) DEMONSTRATION OF TECHNICAL COMPETENCE
 The first thing I look for is the technical  qualifications of the candidate.
 This should come as no surprise. If the candidate has a  technical background
 in the same (or similar) area that the position  requires, then other factors
 may be considered.
                                      
(2) WRITTEN COMMUNICATION SKILLS
 When considering  a   candidate,  the  single most  important   aspect is the
 ability   for that person   to demonstrate  effective  communication  skills.
 Although the ability to orally communicate can not  be fully evaluated in the
 resume  (this must  be done  in   the interview),   a  candidate's ability to
 communicate in writing can.
 
 There   are   several indicators   that  I   use  to   determine good written
 communication skills. The first is  the  resume itself. If  the candidate has
 succinctly  presented  a one-page   description  of  their   capabilities and
 qualifications in a  well organized and   grammatically  correct manner, then
 this tells me this person has potential. Be aware:  misspelled words can hurt
 and typos can be deadly.
 
 Second, I look for  papers. The more  advanced the  degree, the more papers I
 would expect to see. If the candidate has  a Bachelors degree, I would expect
 possibly one or two project papers  that were associated with course-work. If
 the candidate has   a Masters degree,  I would  expect  to see   a conference
 publication and a thesis. Finally, if the candidate  has a doctorate, I would
 expect to see several conference publications,  at least one refereed journal
 article, and the doctoral thesis. I usually ask  the candidates to  send me a
 few of their best papers prior to the interview. Doing this without asking is
 a  very  positive indicator  as  it  shows  pride in  authorship  as well  as
 foresight.
                                      
 (3) PRIOR WORK EXPERIENCE
 It has been  said that there is  no better teacher  than experience (at least
 that is what my mother always told me). This is  especially true when looking
 for a job. One of the best ways to land a job  when  you get out of school is
 to have  a job before you leave.   I look for  student interships,  part-time
 work,  and   research positions on   the resume.   I  don't necessarily place
 off-campus work ahead of on-campus employment, but I do look for work that is
 similar in  nature to  that  I have  a need for.   A  candidate  with  signal
 processing experience would probably be better  suited for a  company dealing
 with  radar applications than  one   dealing with  human factors.   Attaching
 letters  of  recommendation  and/or references from   previous and/or current
 employers along with your cover letter is always good.
                                      
 (4) KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE COMPANY
 Very few  candidates  take  the time to research a  company  before they send
 their  resume. This can  be usually done   with a single   call  to the human
 resources department of the company  and it carries  significant impact. If a
 candidate collects information about a company, then it is  possible to add a
 subtle slant to the resume  to fit the  company's focus. For example, if  you
 are applying to a company and you discover that the  group you are interested
 in working for has been working on a specific  type of  radar system, you can
 phrase your talents  with respect to the capabilities  necessary to work with
 such  systems. This information  is  also useful in  the cover letter and the
 interview. In addition, if a candidate can call the  person that will receive
 the  resume and briefly introduce  themselves, then that  person has improved
 their chances from the start.
                                      
 (5) UNIVERSITY ATTENDED AND DEGREE EARNED
 Note that I have  listed this fifth. This is not accidental. I am looking for
 discriminators when I am looking at a resume. Why  is this person better than
 the other   five  resumes that   I   have seen this  week.   In   my opinion,
 communication skills, prior work experience, and company knowledge  are those
 types  of  valuable discriminators that   carry  much weight.   This does not
 diminish the importance of the degrees.
 
                                      
                                THE INTERVIEW
                                -------------
 The interview is  the candidate's  opportunity to convince  the employer that
 they are the right person for the position. There are several elements that I
 look for when conducting an interview.
                                      
 (1) ORAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS
 One of the most important  elements in the  interview is the demonstration of
 good oral  communication  skills. I look  to see  if  the  candidate listens,
 answers succinctly, and  uses  proper language.    If  a  person gets  easily
 flustered it   is not  a  serious problem--everyone gets  nervous.   If   the
 candidate tends to ramble or of the candidate seems to  easily stray from the
 subject, these  are often seen  as negative attributes.  I   usually pick one
 technical  element from the resume and  ask the candidate to  provide a brief
 explanation   of that work.  Clear   and   understandable explanations have a
 positive impact.
                                      
 (2) DRESS TO IMPRESS
 First  impressions are important.  Dressing  professionally is  a  key  to  a
 successful interview. I am always reminded of  a pair of  pictures that I saw
 in a magazine article many years ago. In the first picture there was a man in
 a long untrimmed  beard, long  hair, a dirty tee-shirt, torn  blue jeans, and
 sneakers. In the second picture was a man  with short neat  hair, no beard, a
 three piece suit, and loafers. Under both pictures was the caption "Which one
 would you  hire?".  The  punch line was that  these pictures were of the same
 person. It might not  be fair that people assess  you by appearance,  but the
 reality is that it happens.
                                      
 (3) ASK QUESTIONS
 I am always impressed by a candidate  that asks questions and shows a genuine
 interest in the position available. Questions demonstrate that  the candidate
 has been  listening and has been thinking.   Good questions  to ask are, What
 would my day-to-day working activities be? What are  the goals of the program
 I would be working on? Who would be my direct supervisor? etc.
 
 Please  remember that  I might  be  looking for  things  that are  completely
 different than another perspective employer. I  hope that these  comments are
 helpful to those students that are, or will be looking for a job  in the near
 future.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   by Paolo Gaudiano <gaudiano@park.bu.edu>

 The last issue of the ISSNNet newsletter  featured  a personal perspective on
 the history of the field of neural networks.  The purpose of that article was
 to show "where we are coming from," and to suggest how a student society such
 as ISSNNet could be useful to the  field.
 
 Since that time the society  has  had its debut  in the "real world," and the
 results have been extremely  positive. This  note summarizes the projects  we
 have worked on this summer, and shows how the experience we gained has helped
 cast the purpose of ISSNNet into more concrete terms. But first, we'd like to
 apologize for the slow response to those of you that have already paid the $5
 membership fee and  have gotten no  response.  We have not forgotten you, and
 you should get a membership card and list of all members very soon.
 
 The first newsletter was followed by an effort to organize  ourselves for the
 conferences in  San Diego  (IJCNN) and Paris (INNC).  The organizers
 for both of  these conferences had donated  a booth for  ISSNNet materials in
 the exhibit hall.  The main purpose of the  booth was to sell T-shirts,  sign
 new  members, and gather  information  on  existing academic programs and job
 opportunities.  The society had an  informal meeting/dinner in San Diego that
 attracted about 60 people.   We signed on almost  100  new  members, and made
 ourselves known  to many people in the   neural network community. Similarly,
 the  Paris  conference attracted   almost 100 more  members,  and established
 further   contacts with  a   number  of   European academic  and professional
 institutions.
 
 We took advantage of these  conferences to publicize two  of our projects: To
 compile  a  listing  of academic programs around the  world that are involved
 with neural networks, and to provide a  profile  of neural network employment
 opportunities for recent graduates.   Specifically, we  asked people  to fill
 out one of our questionnaires, and the  results are summarized  later in this
 newsletter.  In  addition, we  had collected  a number of student resumes and
 submitted them to  companies that have  hired or  are looking to  hire recent
 graduates with neural network experience.
 
 In addition to   these projects,    we   broadened  our network  of   ISSNNet
 "governors" throughout the world.  The purpose of each governor is  to act as
 liaison between ISSNNet and local members,  as well as to encourage formation
 of local  groups for various activities.  This should promote an  exchange of
 information   among  individuals  in  different  fields  and/or at  different
 geographical  locations.   We are currently working  on a complete membership
 list that will be mailed to  official  members, and will  also be broken down
 into geographical areas by the governors.
 
 These examples are helping us to define in concrete terms what it is that the
 society can do, and how it fits in the scheme of neural network research.  As
 many people have   noticed, the "field"  of  neural networks   is  a   highly
 fragmented one.  People in engineering are doing different work from those in
 psychology, or physiology,  or computer science.  Some of the  work is purely
 theoretical, some is purely applied, and a  lot is somewhere in between these
 extremes.  Many companies have little ideas on where  to find good candidates
 for  neural network positions,  and the hiring   criterion is often  based on
 programming experience.  This  problem    seems  to stem from   two  distinct
 phenomena:  First, there   are    extremely few  academic  programs   devoted
 specifically to  neural networks, which makes  it difficult  for companies to
 assess  an individual's  qualifications based on where  he or she received  a
 degree.   Second,  there  is no  real  "standard" in neural  networks.   Many
 applications make use of  back propagation or  other gradient descent models,
 but as of yet there exist no standard benchmarks  or other  methods to decide
 which model is best suited for a particular problem.   As a result, companies
 often hire people simply to   investigate what neural network technology   is
 available, and how it could be applied to their products or research.
  
 The student's perspective  on these problems  was one of  the reasons for the
 creation  of ISSNNet.   Most  students are  only exposed  to  neural networks
 through  a single  established field, which  makes it   difficult to approach
 neural network models that are formulated in the jargon of a different field.
 As   a   result, students  may   become  highly   proficient   in   a  rather
 narrowly-defined  area,   but   may    have  difficulty   finding  employment
 opportunities that take advantage of their learned skills.
  
 It  is important to stress  that ISSNNet is  not  an organized structure with
 well-defined  purposes  and the  means   to carry them  out. Instead, ISSNNet
 should  be  regarded   as  an emergent   structure based  on   the desire  of
 individuals to improve the current state of affairs. The society started when
 a handful of  students realized it was  important to establish a common point
 of contact among students and between students and other organizations.   All
 tasks we have undertaken have been motivated by people's ideas about programs
 that could be useful to the  student community: We  are trying to establish a
 new  link for information  exchange  through various  communication  media by
 using computer mail when  we can, and  surface mail  otherwise.   We  want to
 provide a centralized source of information for prospective students, so that
 they may be able to better select the academic program  that best suits them.
 We   are   establishing   ourselves    as  an  important    liaison   between
 would-be-employees and employers, by providing the companies with information
 on recent graduates, and vice versa.
 
 One of the original  reasons  for the   creation of  the   society was to  do
 something about the declining level  of assistance for students  that want to
 attend neural net conferences.  In the years  since the  first ICNN  and INNS
 conferences, the average student registration fee has  been increasing, while
 the students get less and less for their money.  One of  the reasons for this
 trend  is the unwillingness  to  give students a good  deal (and  thus losing
 money) when it is  unsure how  many attendants  the conference will  draw. As
 part  of our commitment  to  this issue we   may oversee the  organization of
 volunteers for some future IJCNN conferences,  and we have been involved with
 negotiations to insure  that  conference volunteers  get adequate  reward for
 their  work.  We are also  hoping to organize an entire  session dedicated to
 student presentations at some of the future conferences.
 
 From a  more  practical standpoint, we   have officially become  a non-profit
 corporation in the state  of Massachusetts, and  we are planning to apply for
 tax-exempt status  with the IRS, which  makes student support more attractive
 to companies because donations are tax-deductible.  At the same time,  we are
 looking into the possibility of establishing international chapters to better
 handle all the members. We plan on using whatever profits  we make to support
 students in various ways, including direct monetary contributions.
 
 As the society grows in many different  ways,  the tasks  at hand are quickly
 outgrowing our ability to keep up with them. We are finding out, for example,
 just how  much detail  is involved  in setting  up  a  tax-exempt, non-profit
 corporation, and to keep track of  all the memberships and the  programs. One
 of our short-term goals is to  have official elections  before the end of the
 year. We have drafted a set of  bylaws that describe  in great detail how the
 society  will be run,  and  how it will self-organize  for future years (send
 e-mail  to <issnnet@park.bu.edu> for an  electronic copy,  available in plain
 text, PostScript, or LaTeX).
  
                            WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!
 As we  have mentioned,  ISSNNet is  based entirely  on individuals' desire to
 organize   projects that  help the  Neural  Net student  community. Continued
 success depends  on the involvement of a  lot of people.  In this newsletter,
 you  will find the  description  of a number  of positions for  which we need
 volunteers.  If you  would like to  be involved, let  us know.   Among  other
 things, this is a great opportunity to  get  in touch with other students and
 professionals that are interested in the  development of the  field of neural
 networks and the role students play within it.

 At both conferences this last summer (IJCNN in San  Diego and INNC in Paris),
 employment  questionnaires  were passed out  to  many companies attending the
 conference.  The first   part  of   this   column is   a  summary  of   these
 questionnaires.  Most of the companies are from the U.S.A.,  but we hope that
 as ISSNNet grows in the rest of the world, we  will receive  more information
 from other  companies.  In regards to  US companies hiring  foreign students,
 you must contact the company.  In general, it will  be your responsibility to
 get a Visa or work permit.  If you contact one of  these companies, please be
 sure to mention that you heard about them through ISSNNet.
 
 If you have  knowledge   of any companies hiring   please send  electronic or
 surface mail, and we  will be glad to list  them in the following newsletter.
 Good luck to those seeking employment.

                            Request for Proposals:
                            ----------------------
 We were recently  contacted by Simon  Cumming of British  Airway's Artificial
 Intelligence Unit, concerning a small  number of  sponsorships that will soon
 be available.  Mr.  Cumming is presently  conducting a study to determine the
 best use of available funds in the  area of  forecasting.  In particular, Mr.
 Cumming is  investigating  the use  of neural  network techniques to  develop
 applications   concerning forecasting or   data analysis and modelling  in  a
 dynamic  commercial  environment.  Though British   Airways  is based  in the
 United Kingdom, it may be possible  in some cases for  the work to be done in
 other places, providing  a knowledge  engineer from British  Airways would be
 able to visit for review of the project.  Resumes may be sent to:
 Simon Cumming, AI Unit (s590), Unit 2, Hatton Cross Centre,PO Box 10,
 Hounslow, TW62JA, England.   We suggest  that  in  addition to  sending  your
 resume, you include a cover letter  suggesting ways neural network techniques
 can be applied to forecasting.
                                      
                            RESUME SERVICE UPDATE
                            ---------------------
 In general the concept of a resume booklet was eagerly accepted  by employers
 seeking  to establish  a  link to  recent graduates with   studies  in neural
 networks.  In first starting the resume  service, the main  objective  was to
 have a booklet of  resumes of recent  or soon  to be  graduates available  to
 prospective  employers at  the  NNet  conferences. Initially  a  standardized
 resume  format was   not   considered, however after  reviewing   the resumes
 received we realized that a format  may be necessary.  Instead of passing out
 the resumes as a product that the society would offer employers, resumes were
 circulated for review and comments, and  of course if  any employer wanted to
 contact  a   student  they were more   than  welcome.  Comments received from
 employers confirmed the speculation  that  a standardized format is necessary
 in order  for   the resume   booklet to  be  successful.    Two comments made
 repeatedly follow.
 
 1)  Lack of a  Career Objective or  Focus on  Desired Employment: Many of the
 resumes received lacked the focus that employers are  looking for in resumes.
 It  may  be difficult to   write a resume   not   slated towards a particular
 position opening at a known company, but maintaining  some sort  of objective
 about the position you are seeking is crucial in making your resume stand out
 among others.   Typing up your  curriculum  vitae   and pages of publications
 without an objective as to what sort of employment you  are currently seeking
 is leaving too much guess work for any employer to deal with.
 
 2) Resumes were Too Long: Although there was  A  REQUIRED MAXIMUM  OF 2 PAGES
 many of  the resumes received  were 3 or  4 pages  long.    Not only are long
 resumes  usually boring, they often  provide  a lot   of information that has
 nothing to do with   getting a technical job.   In  addition, information  is
 usually repeated. Another reason for a 2 page maximum is that it is expensive
 to reprint    the   resumes.  Over   200   copies of  resumes  were  made for
 distribution. A way to cut down the information  that is not really necessary
 on  the first pass of the  resumes, is to  add a  line  at the bottom  of the
 resume: "Publications, Curriculum Vitae,  and  References upon Request". Once
 contacted by a prospective employer, you can send this information along with
 a cover letter introducing yourself and stating  that you look forward to the
 interview. NOTE: FUTURE  RESUME BOOKLETS WILL  HAVE A 1  PAGE LIMIT. A SECOND
 PAGE WILL BE ALLOWED AT A COST THAT IS YET TO BE  DETERMINED. NO RESUMES OVER
 2 PAGES WILL BE ACCEPTED.
 
 Taking   the suggestion supplied  by  the  many  reviewers a   format will be
 adopted.   Although the format  may be altered  slightly to  better emphasize
 one's experience, any resume that greatly deviates from the standard will not
 be  accepted.  If any  Governor  finds the standard format lacking  for their
 particular country, additional formats may be adopted. The standard format is
 currently being  adopted and will be published  in the next newsletter, along
 with a request for resumes. No resumes are currently being accepted.
 
 Another added point that needs to be made is  that many resumes were received
 past the  deadline and did  not get into  the booklet. Future  deadlines will
 continue to be honored in the same manner.

 This "Undergraduate Issues"  column is  a  way of  showing our  commitment to
 undergraduates, and  to  facilitate their inclusion  in a field dominated  by
 graduate students  and  professionals.   Although we have not    received any
 submissions for this column since the first issue,  in  the future we hope to
 present  undergraduate  research opportunities,  highlight  papers written by
 undergraduates, and present other material to complement the general-interest
 topics that appear in other  columns.  In  our next issue, this  column  will
 feature  a review by  undergraduate Thomeas  Edwards  of the  new concept  of
 "Compostional Learning".  What appears here, though, is to a large part up to
 you.  Are you an  undergraduate involved in neural  network research?  Do you
 have neural net research/programming positions available  for undergraduates?
 If so, send us a note by electronic or surface mail!

 The format of the column  in this issue will be different than usual.  We are
 endeavoring to build an academic program database that will  be useful to the
 entire  research  community.  Towards  this   goal,  we had people  fill  out
 "Academic Program Questionnaires" at  the two  big neural network conferences
 this  summer.  The results are  presented below. The  next ISSNNet newsletter
 should see this column return to its normal format of presenting descriptions
 of academic programs by ISSNNet members.

 Over 30 Schools responded from 11  countries: West  Germany (5), South Africa
 (1), Italy (3), France (6), Belgium (2), Switzerland (2), Cyprus (1), England
 (3), Canada (1), the Netherlands (1), and the USA (12).
 
 The following schools are accepting students in neural networks:

              ISSNNet Request for Academic Program Information
 
 The International Student Society for Neural Networks (ISSNNet)  is compiling
 a  list  of  academic programs relating   to  Neural Networks from around the
 world.  We would like your input if you are a member  of a scholastic program
 that  is  in any way   related to   Neural Networks,    Parallel  Distributed
 Processing,  Connectionism,  Computational   Neuroscience,  Neural  Modeling,
 Neural Computing, etc.
 
 We hope to provide this service so that (1)  interested students will be able
 to apply to those programs that  will most  closely satisfy their educational
 goals, and (2)  current students and  non-students will be aware  of existing
 academic programs.  This service is intended to not  only provide an overview
 of  these programs and  contact  points   for more  information, but  also  a
 personal glimpse  into  what's  behind   the  official    descriptions.  your
 submission will be taken as permission  to make the information public unless
 we are otherwise notified. Information should include:
 
 - Official  address to contact for  more information (surface mail and
   email)
 - Official description of the program.
 - Names of Faculty Members and their interests
 - Degrees requirements (BA, BS, MA, MS, PhD, etc.)
 - Short description of courses offered
 - Computing resources (Hardware and Software Tools)
 - Number of Students (grad/undergrad) and related faculty
 - A  brief *personal* description  of  the   program, department, etc.
   describing motivation, emphasis, goals, and/or overall ambiance.
 - Student Contacts (w/ telephone numbers, email and surface addresses,
   degree sought, interests, and date of graduation)
 
 This information  is above  and beyond the academic  questionnaires that were
 filled out at the San Diego and Paris conferences  and will  be  available to
 members by electronic mail. In the future, an ftp site may also be avaliable.
 Members without access  to  electronic mail should contact  us in writing, or
 contact their local Governor.
 
 Coordinated responses  from  each  institution  are  encouraged  and will  be
 appreciated.  Please submit descriptions of academic  programs in  plain text
 by electronic or surface mail.

 I enjoyed the first edition of the Newsletter.  Its great that  ISSNNet is so
 international. May I suggest that "Spring  Edition"  (or any other season) is
 an inappropriate  designation for  such a world-wide  journal.  Its autumn in
 the Southern  Hemisphere- I can feel the  chill in the air! However basically
 we  do manage to keep the  same calender down here- so   that may  be  a more
 general means of naming your editions. Keep up the good work,  
                Rohan. 
  
 Editor's reply: 
 Well, I'll never cease to  be amazed by  the ease  with  which we forget such
 basic things. Hopefully we won't make the same faux pas on the next issue.

 John Reynolds writes: 
 I wanted to let you know I enjoyed reading the ISSNNet newsletter.   It could
 potentially provide a platform on which to build unity in the  field, without
 the political intrigue some of our elders have been involved in.  If there is
 some way I can help out, please let me know.
 
 A couple of  observations: Especially considering this  is the first issue, I
 think  it was  in   bad  taste to characterize  work   in back-propagation as
 "attention grabbing."   This implies   "flashy and  without substance" to  my
 mind.  Second, while it may  indeed be valid to  argue in favor enhancing the
 interdisciplinary  nature  of the field,  your segregation of neural  network
 research groups into "those of us that are lucky enough to belong to such (an
 interdisciplinary) program" and those who need our help was, I fear, a bit of
 a snub.  While we certainly owe it  to the field  to promote what we perceive
 to be the proper approach to research, it will be  impossible to do so  if we
 antagonize the vast majority.
 
 Other  than  that I was, on  the  whole, pleased   and impressed, and send my
 congratulations and encouragement to  you and  all those who were involved in
 publishing the first issue.
                                      
 Paolo Gaudiano replies: 
 Thanks for the note. I   have heard exactly  the same  remarks from a  couple
 other  people, so I  suspect other  readers may have felt the  same way.  The
 backprop  remark was not  meant to sound  as pejorative as some may interpret
 it,  but rather to suggest that  some of the  work that  put backprop  in the
 spotlight was meant to excite people. In  particular, I personally  found the
 NetTalk  demo to be  an  incredibly compelling demo,  much  more than someone
 telling me "backprop can do nonlinearly-separable  maps", although I now feel
 that the  mathematical  properties of backprop  are  more important  than its
 ability to learn  mappings between specially-constructed   data sets. Perhaps
 "captivating" would have been a better term.
 
 About your second remark, my comment reflects the subjective opinion that the
 study of NNets AS A  FIELD requires an interdisciplinary approach,  something
 only a  few students  have the opportunity  to do.  This does  not imply that
 anyone who only  wishes  to study a  particular application of neural nets is
 any  less of  a  researcher.  Rather,  the    comment was  motivated  by  the
 observation that there are many students who would like to learn more aspects
 of neural nets, but they simply do not have the opportunity  to do it through
 their academic institution. If  other students can provide additional sources
 of information through ISSNNet, then everyone will benefit.

            Call for help: be a part of the ISSNNet organization!
            ---------------------------------------------------- 

 As  the society is  growing, we are  finding out that  it   takes more than a
 handful of people to take  care of  it.  Part  of the effort  in writing  the
 official ISSNNet bylaws was the   description of positions on the   governing
 board, to insure that the  workload would be adequately  distributed  among a
 number of people, so that the well-being of the society  would  not depend on
 few individuals. This is particularly important for a  student society, as we
 all know that the amount of spare time  of a student  is highly variable, and
 of course  we do  not want  society matters to  interfere with good scholarly
 conduct.
 
 The bylaws call for  a flexible governing board,  consisting of  four society
 Officers  (President, Vice President,  Director, and Treasurer), and a number
 of "Governors." The number  of Governors on the  Board at any time depends on
 the number of  members: any group  can  select  a Governor  by sending  us  a
 nomination  letter  with the  name and  signatures  of   at least  ten active
 members. The Governor will primarily act as a liaison between the society and
 the local members. As we try to  provide information exchange through various
 means of communication, it becomes important  to optimize the distribution of
 information. We are charging a $5  annual fee, and  it  can cost $2 to send a
 single newsletter by surface mail to foreign countries.  Even electronic mail
 can be costly across continents.  With a local  Governor, it becomes possible
 to  send a single copy  of  a newsletter  (in various formats)  to one or few
 locations, and have it circulated locally at a much lower cost. The Governors
 should also keep the  society informed of  local  events, maintain a  list of
 local members, and organize annual membership drives.
 
 We already have a number of Governors for various countries around the world,
 but we need more,  particularly  within  the USA.  Because of the multi-media
 nature of ISSNNet, it is important that Governors  have  access to an account
 with electronic mail on a major network (e.g., ARPANET, JANET, BITNET, etc.).
 If you can volunteer an average of  one or  two hours a week (flexible), send
 electronic  mail   to <issnnet-governors@park.bu.edu>   to   receive  further
 details.
 
 The four  Officer positions will be  filled by  election.   We are  trying to
 organize the first elections before the end of the year.  The main  duties of
 the  Officers will  be to represent   ISSNNet and to   insure that all  vital
 society matters are taken care of. This means primarily to oversee volunteers
 assigned to different tasks. If you are interested in  running for one of the
 officer positions, send us a message for more details <issnnet@park.bu.edu>.
 
 The following is a list of some of the tasks for which we need volunteers, if
 you wish to help with one of these, send an e-mail message to:
 <issnnet-volunteers@park.bu.edu>.
 
 *) Maintain overall membership directory.
 *) Organize yearly elections.
 *) Organize membership drive.
 *) Maintain our Industry directory.
 *) Maintain Graduate School Directory.
 *) Maintain Computer database.
 *) Maintain electronic mailing lists.
 *) Basic accounting.
 *) Organize fundraising events.
 *) Organize meetings at conferences.
 *) Oversee/coordinate all governors.
 *) Put together the ISSNNet newsletter.
 
 All of  these positions are on a  voluntary  basis, although we are hoping to
 set up small "scholarships" as a  way of supporting  students  that help with
 these and other tasks. This is primarily  an opportunity for  students to get
 involved with ISSNNet, and can  be a  good way  to  gain experience and  meet
 people. Most of these positions require self-organizing people  that can work
 creatively and independently, because many of these tasks need to be done for
 the first time, and there may not be anyone to provide exact  details of what
 to do. We  hope to be  able to provide  general guidelines and the name  of a
 person to contact for general questions and assistance.
 
 Finally,  a  number of people have   suggested useful projects that  would be
 ideal as ISSNNet activities.   If you have  any projects  that you'd  like to
 organize, let us  know and we'll  try to work something  out.  Some  examples
 would   be  organizing  special   meetings,  or setting   up  a database   of
 public-domain neural net simulators.  Again, you should send ideas to:
 <issnnet@park.bu.edu>.
                                      
          =================== We need a computer! ===================

 We are still looking to get someone to give us access to a computer on one of
 the major networks that we can set up for the following tasks:
 
 *) To maintain our e-mail list and to use as a centralized mail server.
 *) To  set up an  archive for  a  USENET newsgroup that   will complement the
    electronic mailing list.
 *) To set up an anonymous FTP site for access  to various ISSNNet information
    (academic programs, articles, software, whatever).
 *) To take care of general ISSNNet tasks, such as editing and  formatting the
    newsletter, maintaining the membership list, etc.
 
 The ideal solution would be a UNIX workstation with  telnet access,  on which
 we could set up an account  with administrative privileges.  We have a number
 of experienced students that would be willing and able to set up the ftp site
 and the other  things. Because we  are offically incorporated as a non-profit
 organization, equipment   donations   can be   used as    a    tax write-off.
 Alternatively, if   an instituion were willing  to  let us  have control of a
 portion of an existing anonymous FTP site, and maybe an account with a few MB
 of disk, that  would be a good start. If you can  help, please  contact us by
 electronic or surface mail (addresses on front page).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SPONSORS:  We are now an  official non-profit organization. We need monetary
 and material  support.  All our profits  are  used to support  students (with
 minimal overhead through much  volunteer work).  We  would  like  to  receive
 travel and registration money for students  presenting papers at conferences.
 If you want to  sponsor an individual  paper, or wish  to contribute in other
 ways, please send us electronic or surface mail (addresses on front page).

 cost    (US)$5.  Students,  prospective students,  and   recent graduates are

 NOTE FOR NON-USA  Members:  if your country  has a  Governor, his or her name
 should appear on the membership form. Make your payment to that person's name
 in your local currency.  The fee will  be the round  sum  nearest $5  in your
 currency, as decided by your Governor.
  
                      ---- MEMBERSHIP LIST UPDATE: ----
 We apologize to all the members who  have sent in  their fee  and never heard
 from us.   We are compiling a  full membership list to  be   sent  out to all
 members. However, we have  a lot of incomplete  information  for many of you.
 Unfortunately, most  of the forms we sent  out did not  ask for  the member's
 interests in NNets, which is one  of the main  purposes of a membership list.
 We ask that everyone send a brief message to <issnnet@park.bu.edu> describing
 what aspects of NNets you are interested in.
