Application :     Adaptive noise cancellation in fetal electrocardiography
Model :           ADALINE
Hardware/
 Software:        ?
Organization :    Stanford University
Notes :           Use of leads from upper chest and abdomen of mother allow
                        for noise cancellation, thus "revealing" the fetal
                        cardiac waveforms.

Application :     Channel equalization
Model :           ADALINE
Hardware/
 Software:        ?
Organization :    Stanford University
Notes :           Adaptive equalizer uses incoming signals as training
                        response to develop channel inverse, thus
                        compensating for irregularities.  "Any least-squares
                        algorithm can adapt the weights, but the
                        telecommunications industry uses the LMS algorithm
                        almost exclusively."

Application :     Learning Mortgage Underwriting Decisions
Model :           Restricted Coulomb Energy in multiple subnetworks (MNNLS)
Hardware/
 Software:        ?
Organization :    Nestor, Inc.
Notes :           An ANN here was trained on mortgage applications, looking
                        at the approve / disapprove decision.  The network
                        was trained to be conservative.  The test cases were
                        ordered by level of difficulty.  At th simpler end
                        of the scale, the network agreed with the
                        underwriter 96% of the time; at the difficult end,
                        82% of the time.  Differences here stem mainly from
                        a lack of consistency in the underwriter's
                        appraisal.

Application :     Diagnosis of skin disease
Model :           Back-propagation (BP)
Hardware/
 Software:        Software
Organization :    University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
Notes :           Diagnosis of papulosquamous disease using expert diagnosis
                        as training signal for BP.  Performed at about 67%
                        correct diagnosis, which is pretty good given that
                        the field is dermatology.

Application :     Diagnosis of low back pain
Model :           Multi-layer Perceptron
Hardware/
 Software:        Software
Organization :    Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, Frenchay Hospital,
                        Western Infirmary (all groups are in the UK)
Notes :           Multi-layer perceptrons were trained on back pain
                        diagnoses.  In tests against three different groups
                        of doctors and a fuzzy logic system, the only group
                        of diagnoses which the MLP performed less well than
                        the others was simple low back pain.  MLP
                        outperformed other groups for Spinal Pathology test
                        cases, which were the most critical.

Hardware/
 Software:        Software training/hardware product
Organization :    AT&T Bell Labs
Notes :           Corrections for proximity effect in electron beam
                        lithography can be computed using an iterative
                        method, but it's slow.  Software ANN performed to
                        within 0.5% of iterative results, and was 37 times
                        faster.  Hardware version built using weights from
                        software version was over 1000 times faster.

                        the network gave a diagnosis in 64% of cases (47.6%

                        reduced data (derived using principal components

Notes :           38 possible maneuvers, 40 scenarios.  Production system
                        agreed with pilots in 10 scenarios, ANN agreed in

Application :     Seismic first-break picking
Model :           BP
Hardware/
 Software:        Software
Organization :    Amoco
Notes :           Seismic data analysis involves the removal of spurious
                        reflected waves in the, which requires
                        identification of the first break signal.  NN
                        produced 95% accurate results in about a minute for
                        a run of 53 records (81 traces per record).  The
                        accuracy exceeds that of current computational
                        methods, the speed shows an eight-fold improvement
                        over manual picking.

Application :     Loan scoring
Model :           BP
Hardware/
 Software:        Software w/hardware accelerator
Organization :    HNC
Notes :           Financial service tested ANN for loan scoring using a
                        database of 17,000 loans.  10,000 were used for
                        training, the remaining 7,000 for testing.  "The
                        results imply that use of neural network technology
                        could increase overall profitability up to 27% over
                        the existing approval method, in which the company
                        staff uses a computer-based credit scoring
                        algorithm."

Application :     Inspection and quality control

 Software:        Software w/hardware accelerator
Organization :    HNC
Notes :           Video image is processed using FFT, then presented to
                        back-propagation network for classification.  This
                        was demonstrated at 1988 ICNN for use in a product
                        inspection system, where the product was a
                        liquid-filled bottle.  Faults recognized by the
                        system were "fill too low," "fill too high," "label
                        misaligned," and "top not properly in place."

Application :     Bond-rating
Model :           BP
Hardware/
 Software:        Software
Organization :    University of California (Berkeley)
Notes :           ANN compared to multiple linear regression technique for
                        assigning a rating to a bond.  The ANN consistently
                        outperformed the MLR technique (80% compared to 63%
                        on training data; 82% compared to 65% on test data). 
                        Dutta and Shakhar noted that the MLR technique
                        sometimes gave a wildly inaccurate rating when
                        wrong; the ANN never was off by more than one rating
                        level.

                        control 17 hour batch debutanizer process.  Results
                        indicate that the ANN is in control about 80% of the
                        time, more if the batch is unstable.

Notes :           Job scheduling for the resources of the Hubble Space
                        Telescope uses a Hopfield network in conjunction
                        with other tools.  This allows for multiple "good"
