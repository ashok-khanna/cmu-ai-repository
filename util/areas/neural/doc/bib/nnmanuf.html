Compiled List for References to Neural Networks used in Manufacturing Processes
===============================================================================


Created by Stefan Korn, Glasgow Caledonian University : 21.3.1994

Last Change :

Version : I



This is the approach to put together a reference list of this kind. I would 
like to encourage anybody who has any comments or additions or who has found
an error in this list, to write to me and tell me about it. I will try to 
keep this list up to date therefor any help is appreciated.

Stefan.
