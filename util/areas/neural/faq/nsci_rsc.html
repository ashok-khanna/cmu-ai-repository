- ---------------------------------------------------

After considerable effort and plenty of invaluable input and
advice from the Internet's neuroscience community, we are
happy to announce the availability of The Neurosciences
Internet Resource Guide, version 1.0.  This document aims to
be a guide to existing, free, Internet-accessible resources
helpful to neuroscientists of all stripes.  We are pleased
and proud to present the first fruits of our labor, a
snapshot of what we found on the Internet between September
and December of 1993.  This is not a static document -- we
expect it to change and you can help change it.  Let us know
what we missed <nirg@umich.edu>.
