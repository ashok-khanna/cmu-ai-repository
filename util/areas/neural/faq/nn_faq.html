This is a reminder for the existence of a monthly posting to the 
Usenet newsgroup comp.ai.neural-nets. The posting is called 
   FAQ in comp.ai.neural-nets
where FAQ stands for 'Frequently Asked Questions'.

Its purpose is to provide basic information for individuals who are
new to the field of neural networks or are just beginning to read this 
group. It shall help to avoid lengthy discussion of questions that usually 
arise for beginners of one or the other kind.


>>>>> SO, PLEASE, SEARCH THIS POSTING FIRST IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION <<<<<

                           AND

>>>>> DON'T POST ANSWERS TO FAQs: POINT ASKERS TO THE FAQ POSTING  <<<<<


The FAQ posting departs to comp.ai.neural-nets on the 28th of every month.
It is also sent to the group news.answers where it should be available
at any time (ask your news manager).
This reminder is posted every Sunday.

The FAQ posting is archived in the periodic posting archive on
host rtfm.mit.edu (and on some other hosts as well).
Look in the anonymous ftp directory "/pub/usenet/news.answers",
the filename is 'neural-net-faq'.

If you do not have anonymous ftp access, you can access the archive
by mail server as well.  Send an E-mail message to
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "help" and "index" in the body on
separate lines for more information.

The following questions are answered in the FAQ posting:
