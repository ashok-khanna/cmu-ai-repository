Summary:      CMU Neural Networks Benchmark Collection

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains the CMU Neural Networks Benchmark Collection.
   All the benchmark data sets are in a standardized format.  The data
   sets include the NETtalk data, speaker-independent recognition of
   vowels, N-input parity, prediction of secondary structure of proteins,
   classification of sonar signals, distinction of a twin spiral pattern,
   and the traditional XOR task.
