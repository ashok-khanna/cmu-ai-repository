Name:         Eden

Summary:      Poplog-based AI Microworld

Version:      1.0 (29-NOV-92); 2.0 (21-AUG-93)

Description: 

   Eden is a Poplog-based AI microworld developed by Simon Perkins,
   Jocelyn Paine and Edmund Chattoe of the Oxford University Artificial
   Intelligence Society. It is intended to serve as a testbed for
   learning and planning programs. Programs written in Pop-11, Prolog,
   Lisp, and ML control a "bug" that lives in a 2-dimensional world. Any
   kind of algorithm may be used to control the bug, including genetic
   algorithms, neural nets, and rule-based systems. Eden consists of a
   grid of cells, each of which can contain objects such as keys, doors,
   boulders and quicksand. Bug's objective is to find and eat a piece of
   food which the simulator has placed somewhere within this grid. To do
   this, Bug must negotiate its way towards the food while dealing
   intelligently with obstacles. Eden's laws of physics allow Bug to take
   one of several different actions when it encounters an object. The
   simulator then works out the consequences of the chosen action on Bug
   and on Eden, and displays these graphically in a Ved window. Bug's
   perceptions are updated to reflect the new state of the world, and the
   cycle repeats. 

   Eden includes PopBeast, a simple Prolog bug which can read and
   parse simple commands, extract their meaning, plan how to satisfy
   these commands, and then carry out the plans.

   Two versions of Eden are included. Version 1 is the original, which
   was used in the bug competition. Version 2 is an updated version
   used by Jocelyn Paine in an AI and Prolog course and includes a
   production-system bug. Version 2 is not compatible with the
   original and is not intended for the competition; please use the
   original for that.

Requires:     PopLog, Pop-11, Prolog, Lisp, ML

Ports:        Parts of the current Eden are coded in Pop-11, so
              porting it to Prologs other than Poplog will require
              some effort. Most of the recoding needed is in the
              grid-world simulator and the definition of objects. Send
              mail to Jocelyn Paine <popx@vax.oxford.ac.uk> if you're
              willing to try this.
