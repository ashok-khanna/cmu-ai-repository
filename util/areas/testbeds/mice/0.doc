Summary:      Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment testbed

Version:      MICE 2.0 (18-OCT-92); MacMICE 3.0 (1-APR-94)

Description: 

   The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is a
   tool for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems
   under a variety of conditions.  MICE simulates a two-dimensional
   grid-world in which agents may move, communicate, and affect their
   environment.  MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that
   helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides
   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain
   and its properties, etc.  

   Source code, documentation, and examples are included.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        MICE runs on Un*x boxes (under XWindows), on Macs (MACL), and
              on TI Explorers, with relatively consistent graphical
              displays.
