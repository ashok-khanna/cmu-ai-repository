Summary:      Abstract Robot Simulator

Version:      1.0 (27-JAN-93)

Description: 

   The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
   includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
   interface to the X window system. The simulator is written in Nisp,
   a macro-package for Common Lisp. 
   
   RPL is the reactive plan language interpreter.

Requires:     Common Lisp, CLX, Nisp, X Windows
