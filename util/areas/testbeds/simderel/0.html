<H2>Simderella: Robot Simulator</H2>

Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
(the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot. It is a fast
general-purpose display method which places separate objects in space
depending on the homogeneous matrices it receives from SIMMEL. CONNEL
is the controller, which must be designed by the user. In the
distributed version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.
No neural networks are included.  The programs use Unix sockets for
communication, so you must have sockets, but you can run the programs
on different machines.  Since data communication is high-level (all
data is encoded before transmission), cross architecture portability
is high.  In fact, CONNEL can simultaneously control a real robot and
the simulated one.  When nothing is happening, Simderella will sleep
and not use any processor time.
