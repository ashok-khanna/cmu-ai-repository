Major number changes hardly ever occur.
Minor number changes when libraries change.
Subminor number changes frequently.

2.0 -> 2.0.1: (March 17, 1994)
	Added
	#elif linux
	#       define HAVE_SIGNBIT             0
	#       define HAVE_IEEE_INCLUDES       0
	#       define HAVE_GETDTABLESIZE       1
	in include/config.h.  Thanks to Scott Heavner <sdh@po.cwru.edu>
	who again tried to install Simderella under Linux.
	Since this is so important, I decided to make it into
	a new release immediately...

1.1 -> 2.0:
	- New Feature: Imakefiles.  Simplifies installation.
	  The libraries "communication.a" and "matrix.a" have
	  been renamed to "libcommunication.a" and "libmatrix.a"!
	  The include/config.h needs no change anymore, if I'm
	  not mistaken.  If you need to change some defines,
	  please let me know.
	- runs on DEC Alpha (implemented by Conor Doherty):
	  o simmel/communication.c: send_end_effector() call to encode()
	    must be augmented with dummy 0.0's
	  o bemmel/datastruct.c in convert(): repair for the
	    case when #elements passed to calloc is zero
	  o entry in config.h for Alpha,
	- NR_LINKS is now defined in the right place, i.e., global.h
	- added "case BEMMEL" in simmel/main.c, as
	  a possible return value from select_receive_next_command().
	  (October 14, 1993).  Accepts also "HALT".
	- changed "#include <strings.h>" to "#include <string.h>"
	  in bemmel/input.c.  The calls to index() are replaced by
	  the SYSV call to strchr().
	- in simmel, the matrices for bemmel are not computed
	  anymore when no bemmels are connected.
	- compiles now also under Solaris on a SUN.  This required
	  some adaptations in, mainly, the communication.a library.
	  To compile for Solaris, first do a make clear, then a make
	  depend, and finally a make.
	- bemmel has been updated:
	  o when holding the left mouse button depressed in the window,
	    the incoming homogeneous matrices (in fact, all messages
	    from simmel) will be blocked.  The robot can now be moved
	    by moving the mouse pointer.
	  o resize works correctly now w.r.t. positioning of the robot
	  o the "o" (origin) command follows resizes.  Try resizing the
	    robot, move it around, and press "o": it retains its size
	    and position after the resize.
	- includes a new program in stand-alone-bemmel/ for drawing
	  3D geometrical figures.

Version 1.0.2 -> 1.1 (October 1993):
	- added "make depend" to makefiles
	- simmel now computes the apparent velocity and acceleration of
	  the object relative to the hand, due to the motion of the
	  hand itself.  A new message "GET_POSITION_AND_D" is introduced
	  which requests the (x, x' x", y, y', y", z, z', z") of the
	  object in the hand coordinate frame.  Notice that the fact
	  that the object may be moving is not included; this extension
	  is trivial, however.  See relative_object_motion() in
	  kinematic.c.
	- WAIT and CONTINUE signals now must match!  Sending a WAIT
	  signal to simmel increments the wait variable, CONTINUE decrements
	  it.  Only when at least as many CONTINUE signals are sent as
	  WAIT signals, the robot will continue moving.
	- a new command interpreter in connel, now word-based instead
	  of character-based.
	- no more "version numbers" since I never updated them anyway.

Version 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2 (March 11, 1993):
	Suggested by sdh@falstaff.MAE.cwru.edu (Scott Heavner),
	corrections for compilation under (POSIX and) Linux.
	Basically, rewriting the signbit() and iszero()
	routines, since fp_class.h is not available under Linux.

Version 1.0 -> 1.0.1:
	A new file "include/config.h" has been created which
	is included in each and every .h and .c file.  Most
	notably, this file has a flag to set for compilation
	on SGI.  Documentation has changed accordingly.

	Files are now compiled with "gcc -O2" instead of "gcc -g".
