                                     Bugs
 
     Bugs is my first major attempt at artificial life except for a 
couple ofemergent complexity simulations I've written.  What Bugs
essentially does isproduce a map on the screen with sharp graphics
(16 color for quick animationbut still very impressive if I don't say
so myself).  The user may release anumber of bugs into a variantly
hostile environment dependent on how the usersets the large number of
controls at their disposal.  The bugs move about onthe map eating
plants which appear occasionally.  The bugs are equipped withseveral
genes, modifying mainly how the bugs search for food and how their
energy is expended.  If a bug runs out of energy, it dies.  If a bug
reachesthe reproduction energy threshold it reproduces introducing
mutations intothe offspring's genes.  Over time it is possible to see
the entire genepool(visible through several bar graphs) converge at new points, different fromthe values set at the beginning of the simulation.
This is primarily asimulation that can be used to show that mass
populations can and will altertheir overall genepool to adapt to an
environment, the fundamental theorynecessitated in evolution.
