Summary:      Bugs search for food and adapt or die

Version:      9-MAR-95

Description: 

   This directory contains an artificial life simulation of emergent
   complexity in a bug population.

   The user may release a number of bugs into a variantly hostile
   environment dependent on how the user sets the large number of
   controls at their disposal. The bugs move about on the map eating
   plants which appear occasionally.  The bugs are equipped with several
   genes, modifying mainly how the bugs search for food and how their
   energy is expended.  If a bug runs out of energy, it dies.  If a bug
   reaches the reproduction energy threshold it reproduces introducing
   mutations into the offspring's genes.  Over time the entire genepool
   (visible through several bar graphs) converges at new points,
   different from the values set at the beginning of the simulation.
   This is primarily a demonstration that mass populations can and will
   alter their overall genepool to adapt to an environment, a fundamental
   requirement of evolution.
