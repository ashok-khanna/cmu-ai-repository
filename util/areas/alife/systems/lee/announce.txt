specific information on how to compile and run the program.
To get the PostScript paper, use the Unix utility 'uncompress'.
To unpack the source and/or Mac executables you must use the Unix 
utility 'unshar'. After this, to get the binary Mac executables 
and/or resource file, use, eg, 'BinHex 4.0'.

OVERVIEW OF LEE (from lee.doc)
==============================

        LEE (Latent Energy Environments) is both an Alife model
and a software tool to be used for simulations within the
framework of that model. We hope that LEE will help us understand
a broad range of issues in theoretical, behavioral, and
evolutionary biology. The LEE tool described here consists
of approximately 7,000 lines of C code and runs in both Unix
and Macintosh platforms.

        The modeling of environmental complexity across
different Alife experiments is perhaps the main motivation behind
this project. LEE allows the specification of environments of
graduated complexity. A spacially distributed series of
"atomic elements" must be combined to transform their "latent
potential energy" into "work" necessary for survival.
Behavioral strategies must be evolved by the population such
as to allow an efficient exploitation of the available energy.
This latent energy can be used to measure the environment
complexity with respect to the survival task.

        A steady-state genetic algorithm is used in the 
LEE model rather then a lock-step generational one. The
progression of the adaptive process is measured in terms of time
rather than generations. At any one time step possibly all the
organisms in the population may live, use and/or acquire energy,
and reproduce or die. Consequently, the size of the population
varies with time. If latent energy is not made available at a
rate sufficient to support the energy expense of the
population, extintion may occur.

        An organism is implemented by a feed-forward neural
network plus a sensory-motor system and a gut, i.e. a
reservoir for energy, both in work (usable) and latent
(atomic elements) form. The sensory system consists of a
user-specified set of sensors that are mapped onto the network
input units. The network may have as many hidden layers as desired.
The output layer maps its activation values onto the motor
system, made of a set of user-specified motors. Learning can
occur in the current version by means of standard
back-propagation of error. The error is computed on an input
prediction task.

        Each organisms lives by moving in a world consisting
of a rectangular grid with toroidal edge conditions. Each
basic life cycle (sweep) consists of 5 steps:
1. Gather information about the surrounding world by means of
   a set of sensors.
2. Elaborate the sensory information to produce a motor action.
3. Make a movement in the world by means of a set o motors.
4. (Optional) Use the new sensory information as teaching
   input for a prediction task learned during an organism's
   lifetime on a subset of the neural net.
5. Consequences of the movement: there is an energy cost,
   there may be an energy increase or decrease (depending on the
   contents of the new world position and the reactions caused
   by the acquisition of such contents), and finally these energy
   changes may result in death or reproduction.

        Different sensor systems implemented in the current
version are: GUT, CONTACT, and AMBIENT. The first senses 
elements present in an organism's own gut; the second senses 
those present in the world cell in front of the position 
currently occupied by the organism; the third senses those 
present in a local range, weighed according to their distange 
in number of steps. Each sensor has a complex that identifies 
which elements can be sensed by it.
	There is one simple  motor system currently implemented:
BINARY. It allows the organism to make one of four possible
moves: stay still, turn left or right 90 degrees, or move
ahead. Each motor has a power that specifies how far the
organism can be moved by it.

(*) This paper is available on the LEE ftp site as
    'pinep.ps.Z'. An abstract follows:

A novel ALife model and simulator, called LEE, is introduced
and described. The motivation lies in the need for a measure
of complexity across different ALife experiments. This goal is
achieved through a careful characterization of environments in
which different forms of energy are well-defined and
conserved. A steady-state genetic algorithm is used to model
the evolutionary process. Organisms in the population are
modeled by neural networks with non-Lamarckian learning during
life. Behaviors are shown to be crucial in the interactions
between organisms and their environment. The flexibility of
LEE for the study of a variety of problems related to complex
evolutionary systems is illustrated by some general emerging
properties of the model, and by preliminary results of a
number of experiment currently under way.
