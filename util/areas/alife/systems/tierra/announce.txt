1) Tierra moves to ATR in Japan

     The Tierra project has emerged from a one year period of dormancy,
and has moved to the new Evolutionary Systems Department headed by
Katsunori Shimohara, in the Human Information Processing Research
Laboratories of ATR (Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute
International).  ATR is located in the new Kansai Science City, near
Nara and Kyoto.

     Tom Ray came to ATR as an invited researcher on August 8, 1993,
and is on a two year leave of absence from the University of Delaware.
Current email is ray@hip.atr.co.jp, ray@udel.edu is forwarded.
Kurt Thearling joined ATR as a research affiliate on November 1, 1993.
Kurt remains an employee of Thinking Machines, but will be working on
the Tierra project at ATR until April 1994.  Email is kurt@hip.atr.co.jp,
kurt@think.com is forwarded.

     The primary objective of the Tierra project for the coming months
will be to experiment with the evolution of multi-cellular digital
organisms, which are parallel processes.

      Several other evolutionary projects are also underway in the
 Evolutionary Systems Department at ATR as follows:

 - CAM-Brain project aiming at growing/evolving an artificial brain, which
   contain thousands of interconnected artificial neural network modules,
   inside special hardware called Cellular Automata Machines.
   Hugo de Garis, degaris@hip.atr.co.jp

 - Emergent Intelligence project modeling intelligence as a non-linear
   developmental process from genotype to phenotype, under the influence
   of the environment.  Jari Vaario, jari@hip.atr.co.jp

 - EgoWare (Evolutionary Generator of Genome in Hardware) project aiming
   at self-producing hardware-description programs by evolving
   HDL (Hardware Description Language) production rules and derivation
   trees.  Hitoshi Hemmi, hemmi@hip.atr.co.jp and Junichi Mizoguchi,
   mizo@hip.atr.co.jp

 - Learning methods for modularized neural networks with evolvability
   aiming at developing an autonomous system consisting of heterogeneous
   neural network modules.  Sung-Bae Cho, sbcho@hip.atr.co.jp

 - Computational evolutionary biology, Kennosuke Wada, kwada@hip.atr.co.jp

 - Chaotic information processing, Yukio Hayashi, yhayashi@hip.atr.co.jp
   and Masaaki Sato, masaaki@hip.atr.co.jp

 - Alife and music, Seiji Adachi, adachi@hip.atr.co.jp and
   Hiroyuki Ohtsuki ohtsuki@hip.atr.co.jp

     Additional foreign researchers will be joining the department next
year to extend these projects to evolutionary robotics and molecular
computers.

2) New manuscripts available

     Several new manuscripts have been written, and are listed with
the Tierra publications below.  The most important two manuscripts have
also been placed in the Tierra ftp site (see section 7 below).  These
two manuscripts are in the /doc directory of the ftp site.  The one in
press at the journal Artificial Life is available as the file
Zen.tex.  The one submitted to Physica D is available as the
file PhysicaD.tex.  Unfortunately this second manuscript includes a
lot of figures which are not available electronically.

8) Tierra ftp access

     The Tierra V4.0 source code; and the source code, and DOS executables
of all tools; and documentation and manuscripts is available.  Please
note that the source code in the ftp site and the source code provided on
disk will each compile and run on either DOS or UNIX platforms.  It is
exactly the same source code in either case.  The DOS executables are
available only on disk (available from Virtual Life), and can not be
freely distributed.

     The complete source code and documentation (but not executables) is
available by anonymous ftp at:

tierra.slhs.udel.edu [128.175.41.34] and
  life.slhs.udel.edu [128.175.41.33]

in the directories: almond/, beagle/, doc/, and tierra/.

To get it, ftp to tierra or life, log in as user "anonymous" and give your
email address (eg. tom@udel.edu) as a password.  Be sure to transfer binaries
in binary mode (it is safe to transfer everything in binary mode).
Each directory contains a compressed tar file (filename.tar.Z) and a SRC
directory that contains all the files in raw ascii format.  You can just
pick up the .tar.Z files, and they will expand into the complete directory
structure with the following commands (Unix only):

uncompress tierra.tar.Z
tar oxvf tierra.tar

9) Mailing Lists

     There are two mailing lists for Tierra users.  The first list is for
people who only want to get the official announcements, updates and bug-fixes.
The other will carry the official postings, and are intended for discussion
of Tierra by users.  This one is distributed in digest form, when there is
enough material.  The lists are:

tierra-announce    official updates, patches and announcements only
tierra-digest      discussion, updates, etc. (digest form)

The addresses are: 

tierra-request@life.slhs.udel.edu   the list administrator (Tom Uffner). to
                                    be added, removed, or complain about
                                    problems with any of these lists.

tierra-digest@life.slhs.udel.edu    to post to the list.

tierra-bug@life.slhs.udel.edu       for bug-reports or questions about the
                                    code or installation.

     You may also be interested in the Artificial Life mailing list.

10) What Tierra Is

     The C source code creates a virtual computer and its operating system,
whose architecture has been designed in such a way that the executable
machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the machine code can be mutated
(by flipping bits at random) or recombined (by swapping segments of code
between algorithms), and the resulting code remains functional enough of the
time for natural (or presumably artificial) selection to be able to improve
the code over time.

     Along with the C source code which generates the virtual computer, we
provide several programs written in the assembler code of the virtual
computer.  Some of these were written by a human and do nothing more than make
copies of themselves in the RAM of the virtual computer.  The others evolved
from the first, and are included to illustrate the power of natural selection.

     The operating system of the virtual computer provides memory management
and timesharing services.  It also provides control for a variety of factors
that affect the course of evolution: three kinds of mutation rates,
disturbances, the allocation of CPU time to each creature, the size of the
soup, etc.  In addition, the operating system provides a very elaborate
observational system that keeps a record of births and deaths, sequences
the code of every creature, and maintains a genebank of successful genomes.
The operating system also provides facilities for automating the ecological
analysis, that is, for recording the kinds of interactions taking place
between creatures.

     This system results in the production of synthetic organisms based on
a computer metaphor of organic life in which CPU time is the ``energy''
resource and memory is the ``material'' resource.  Memory is organized into
informational patterns that exploit CPU time for self-replication.  Mutation
generates new forms, and evolution proceeds by natural selection as different
genotypes compete for CPU time and memory space.

     Diverse ecological communities have emerged.  These digital communities
have been used to experimentally examine ecological and evolutionary
processes: e.g., competitive exclusion and coexistence, host/parasite density
dependent population regulation, the effect of parasites in enhancing
community diversity, evolutionary arms race, punctuated equilibrium, and the
role of chance and historical factors in evolution.  This evolution in a
bottle may prove to be a valuable tool for the study of evolution and ecology.
