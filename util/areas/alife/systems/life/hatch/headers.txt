Conway's game of life on a torus, for a black&white Sun screen (/dev/bwtwo0).
Uses a very clever method of calculating 32 positions at once.
I don't know who invented it, but Lew Hitchner gave it as an assignment
in his Computer Architecture course at UCSC.
I optimized it as much as I could, so even I don't understand it any more.

On a sparc (compiled with -O) it gives about 6.8 frames per second
full screen, and proportionately faster on smaller regions.
