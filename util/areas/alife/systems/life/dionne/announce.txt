To the folks who requested a life program:

Yes, I know it is in VMS FORTRAN and designed for VT100 terminals...but hey, 
at least I posted _something_ ?!  BTW, I used a 1-D array as opposed to the 
traditional 2D array... and a few programming tricks to make execution time
run a little faster (like updating only the elements that change from screen
to screen instead of redrawing the screen each cycle).  I don't know if anyone
would actually want to use this code... but hey, you never know.

The code reads an initialization file:  LIFE.DAT  it then uses that to plot
the stuff on screen.
