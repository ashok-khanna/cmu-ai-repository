Summary:      Implementation of Conway's Game of Life for the PC.

Version:      1.06 (1-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains a fast implementation of Conway's Game of
   Life for the IBM PC. It allows a huge universe (524288 x 524288)
   and includes a large collection of patterns.

Requires:     

Ports:
