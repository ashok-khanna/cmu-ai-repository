Description

BioSimPC is a biologically oriented neuronal network simulator. 
It has a graphical interface enabling the user to create networks
to his liking. The neurones comprise three passive and one active
isopotential compartments. Active membrane properties can be modelled
by a simple on/off model or by a Hodgkin-Huxley type model. 
Ion channel and passive parameters may be changed by the user. 
The simulated potentials and currents of each neurone can be observed.
On-line help is supplied.
