Name:         BIOSIM

Summary:      Biologically-Oriented Neural Network Simulator

Version:      8-DEC-93

Description: 

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  BIOSIM includes a graphical user interface and was
   designed for research and teaching.

   NOTE: This is *not* the BIOSIM program of Per Hammarlund (Sweden).

Requires:     C

Ports:        UNIX workstations, PCs. The PC version is less powerful
              than the UNIX version.
