Summary:      Better to Use Genetic Systems

Version:      17-SEP-92

Description: 

   BUGS is a simple interactive genetic algorithms program. The system
   displays critters on the screen (graphs of Fourier Series) and lets
   the user select fit ones with the mouse. It is written in the spirit
   of Richard Dawkins' celebrated Blind Watchmaker software.  Breeding is
   by the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
   Illustrates genetic drift and premature convergence.

Requires:     C. Runs under Suntools and X Windows.
