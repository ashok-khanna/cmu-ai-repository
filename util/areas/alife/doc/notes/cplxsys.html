             	   Complex Adaptive Systems Information
		   ____________________________________

"Life is if it dies when you stomp on it."

Ok, for the past few months I've been looking for stuff that deals with Complex
Adaptive Systems and one thing has emerged : some order to the information out
there still needs to emerge ! This document represents the resources I've 
found so far, and while not exhaustive, still represents a fair slice of what 
is out there in terms of easily-accesible information.
Hope it makes life a little easier for someone !

o To retrieve via email, send mail to thesisnet-request@eniac.seas.upenn.edu 
  with the subject 'cplxsys'.

o Access via Mosaic : point your URL at 
  http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ale/cplxsys.html 
  This version is to be preferred, since it also has links to WWW sites in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FTP SITES

The following are some ftp sites which I've come across here and there
while wandering around blindly trying to find stuff on the Net.  The hyperlinks
get you to the appropriate top-level directories, since for sites like 
life.anu.edu.au and funic.funet.fi, there are quite a few potentially 
interesting sub-directories. 

o The ftp site at <life.anu.edu.au>, in /pub/complex_systems which is further 
subdivided into stuff like Alife, CA, Neural Nets etc. This also has an
ftp site containing papers presented at Complex Systems '92, held in
Australia, in the directory pub/complex_systems/anu92.

o The  UCLA ftp site at <cognet.ucla.edu> in /pub/alife  with a fairly 
extensive Alife bibliography, some source code and a few papers.

o The ftp site at <funic.funet,fi> , in pub/sci, which, it's maintainers claim,
is the largest ftp site in the world in all subjects ... it has stuff on Neural
Nets, Neurophysiology, Artificial Intelligence and lots of other such
subjects.  A really useful file to look at before anything else is the
file '00INDEX' in the directory pub/sci/neural.

o The Neuroprose Archives at Ohio State University : 
<archive.cis.ohio-state.edu>, in pub/neuroprose. Has _lots_ of stuff on
connectionism. Look at INDEX file for overview.

o The ftp site at <ftp.cogs.susx.ac.uk>, in /pub/reports/csrp : a whole bunch 
of PostScript files containing god-knows-what.

o The ftp site at <soda.berkeley.edu>, in /pub/corewar, contains some
information on Core Wars, concerned with evolving competing programs in
machine code. There is a tutorial on Core War, at the same site, in
pub/corewar/documents/tutorial.1.Z and pub/corewar/documents.2.Z. See also
the 'Newsgroups and Mailing Lists' and 'FAQs' sections.

o The Los Alamos National Laboratory ftp site at  <xyz.lanl.gov> in /nlin-sys: 
this contains preprints of various papers under the same headings as given 
later on in this document for the  *Nonlinear Science Bulletin Board*. 
(Seeing as they are at the same address, this is probably not surprising :-) )

o There is an archive for the Genetic Algorithm Digest at 
<ftp.aic.nrl.navy.mil>,in pub/galist.

o The  Xerox PARC site at <parcftp.xerox.com>, in /pub/dynamics,has some papers
on the evolution of cooperative behaviour.


o The Santa Fe Institute, which is pretty much the place where all the alife 
and complex systems stuff started, also has an ftp site, at ftp.santafe.edu. 
The pub/Users/mm subdirectory has some interesting papers on GA/CA.
The ENCORE (Santa Fe Institute Evolutionary Computation Repository) has an
excellent collection of papers/programs, at <alife.santafe.edu> in 
/pub/USER-AREA/EC. Look at the OVERVIEW and README files first.

o The TIERRA ftp site, which is the official site for all things 
Tierra-related : ftp to <life.shls.udel.edu> or to <tierra.slhs.udel.edu>. 
These sites have up-to-date source code, documentation and manuscripts.

o There is an ftp site for nonlinear systems, with both code and papers, at 
<lyapunov.ucsd.edu>, in /pub. Check out the file pub/README for a list of 
everything that is there.

o The archives of the Cellular Automata Mailing List are available 
via anonymous ftp at <think.com>, in the directory /mail, in the files
'ca.archive*' ie 'ca.archive-1987.Z' holds the compressed version of 
the 1987 correspondence. The current years' archive is not compressed and 
is in the file 'ca.archive'.

o The Illinois Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (IlliGAL) has an ftp site with 
some of its' technical reports, a GA bibliography and some reprints at
<gal4.ge.uiuc.edu>, in the directory /pub/papers/IlliGALs. The source code
in C for Messy GA is also available there, in pub/src. The file README in
pub/papers/IlliGALs has a list of all the papers currently available on the
server.

o An archive of genetic programming is at <ftp.cc.utexas.edu>, in 
/pub/genetic-programming.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIFIC PROGRAMS/PAPERS

The following list is, of course, nowhere near exhaustive; these are just 
programs/papers I've seen/read and that are mentioned fairly frequently. In
most cases, the hyperlinks just get you to the relevant directory, and it's 
up to you to retrieve the appropriate files; I've included the names of the 
'non-obvious' ones. (Unix source code is mostly archived in a file called 
*.tar.Z ... this needs to be uncompressed and 'untarred').


(the addresses come first, followed by a short description in most cases)

o <tierra.slhs.udel.edu> or <life.slhs.udel.edu>. These sites have 
source code (runs on both UNIX and DOS platforms) and documentation for TIERRA,
Thomas Ray's way cool digital ecology simulation. There are also some 
manuscripts on Tierra at this site, in the /doc subdirectory.  See also the 
Tierra mailing list below.

o <ftp.apple.com> in /pub/polyworld. POLYWORLD , another neat simulator,
complete with C++ source code written to run on a SILICON GRAPHICS machine and 
technical paper describing polyworld. README file has more info.

o <funic.funet.fi>, in /pub/sci/neural/genesis. GENESIS :  this is a 
program for Neural Network simulation, runs on X11 platforms and is supposed to
have rather good graphics.

o <alife.santafe.edu>, in /pub/SOFTWARE/Cellsim. CELLSIM, a cellular 
automata simulator.

o To obtain CELLULAR, a programmable CA simulator, send mail to 
<Majordomo@Think.Com>, with the message 
"get cellular-automata cellular.tar.gz.uu" or 
"get cellular-automata cellular.zip.uu" in the text body to get the UNIX or 
DOS versions respectively. (The DOS version should be unzipped with the
-d option.)

o <alife.santafe.edu>, in pub/USER-AREA/EC. This is the ENCORE (Santa Fe 
Institute Evolutionary Computation Repository), which has a _lot_ of papers and
programs. The file OVERVIEW is a list of all the stuff.

o <funic.funet.fi>, in /pub/sci/neural/SNNS. SNNS, a neural network 
simulator written at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

o <soda.berkeley.edu>, in /pub/corewar/systems.  This contains 
implementations of Core War for various sytems (Mac, PC and Unix/X-Windows).
See also the FAQ section.

o <life.anu.edu.au>, in /pub/complex_systems/alife/life. Game of Life: 
there are various Life forms ( geddit ?), for PCs and UNIX. Files ending in 
.zip are for PCs.

o <ralph.cm.cf.ac.uk>, in pub/GAs, there is an introduction to Genetic
Algorithms for beginners in two parts, as ga_overview1.ps and 
ga_overview2.ps.

o <life.anu.edu.au>, in /pub/complex_systems/alife. BUGWORLD simulates a 
bug-ecology, with predators and all. File is called  bugworld.tar.Z.

o <life.anu.edu.au>, in /pub/complex_systems/alife. L-systems : Aristid 
Lindenmayers' L-systems can be used for various neat things, like growing 
natural-looking plants out of very simple rules. The file is called 
lsys.tar.Z.

o <life.anu.edu.au>, in /pub/complex_systems/alife. Biomorphs: I have a 
strong feeling that this is Richard Dawkins' program that simulates evolution 
of what he calls 'biomorphs'; evolutionary pressure is towards critters that 
look interesting. It looks like this file is for PCs; it's called biomrf.zip.

o <alife.santafe.edu>, in pub/USER-AREA/EC/EA/src. LEE : Latent Energy
Environment, an Alife simulator. There is also a paper on it, available
from pub/USER-AREA/EC/EA/papers.
