NEW COURSE ANNOUNCEMENT...

... THE COURSE THAT'S BEEN MILLIONS OF YEARS IN THE MAKING ...

ARTIFICIAL LIFE 
COMPUTER SCIENCE 425
WINTER QUARTER 1993

Existing carbon-based lifeforms exploit energy (primarily from the 
sun) available from the environment to organize matter available 
from the environment in order to survive, reproduce, and evolve.  
Artificial life is synthetic biology.  The study of artificial life attempts 
to extrapolate the computational characteristics of the single instance 
of life observable on earth to the full range of possibilities that might 
arise using different materials, initial conditions, and evolutionary 
paths.  Because of the extreme behavioral plasticity of computer 
programs, the emphasis is on implementations of artificial life via the 
medium of computer programs.  Computational forms of artificial life 
exploit computer time to organize computer memory in order to 
survive, reproduce, and evolve.  

Artificial life will be presented from the perspective of both the 
major tools and the major issues of the field.   The major issues 
include the following:

Self-reproducing automata and computer programs
Spontaneous emergence of self-replicating computer programs
Emergence of diversity and complexity
Dynamics of evolution
Computational metabolisms and algorithmic chemistry
Programmable matter
Learning and development
Emergent computation
Universal computation at the edge of chaos
Applications

The following tools are currently employed in research in artificial 
life and will each be covered as needed: 
Cellular automata
Dynamical systems
ECHO system
Genetic algorithms
Genetic programming
Lindenmayer systems
Neural networks
Redcode
Turing gases

Organic life and molecular biology will be briefly surveyed.

Textbooks are Artificial Life II: Santa Fe Institute Studies in the 
Sciences of Complexity by Christopher Langton (Addison-Wesley 
1992, HB or PB) and a course reader available at Stanford bookstore.

Place:.......................Building 420 - Room 041
Instructor:         John R. Koza.    224 Margaret Jacks Hall.

Subject: Stanford ALIFE course reader

This is first of several messages I intend to post in the next few 
weeks to
this mailing list concerning my upcoming course, Computer Science 
425, at
Stanford on Artificial Life.

The textbooks for the course consists of Chris Langton's ALIFE-2 
books plus a
course reader produced by the Stanford Bookstore containing a 
number of
articles from other ALIFE sources.

The course reader may be purchased from the Stanford Bookstore at
415-329-1217 or 800-533-2670 and they ship everywhere. It's $36.

The contents of the course reader are shown below.

the rationale for the selection of these items to accompany Chris's 
book will
be covered when I send out the syllabus of reading assignment and 
course
lecture schedule for the course.  The course starts in early January 
1993.
