          The following are the items noted down at the meeting of the
          "Artificial Life Syllabus Group", which took place in the
          park of the Plaza of Santa-Fe, on June/18/1992.

          I composed them as a note, both in order to have a neater
          list than the pages we photo copied at Santa-Fe, and for the
          benefit of the "new-comers".

          Outlines of a Seminar in Artificial Life
          ---------------------------------------
          Emanuel Gruengard


          During the academic year 1990-1991 I have conducted a
          one semester seminar in Artificial life, for graduate
          students at the Department of Mathematics and Computer
          Science of the Bar-Ilan University in Israel.

          Nine registered students participated in the seminar, as
          well as a varying number of additional non-registered
          students (0 to 5), who drifted in and out of various
          lectures.

          Each of the student had two assignments, that he/she had to
          accomplish during the one and a half, to one and three
          quarters hour sessions that were allotted to him/her. The
          first one was a presentation and a discussion of a selected
          chapter from Artificial Life I (there was no Artificial Life
          II at that time). The second one, was a either
          running a demo of a small program, that had a relevance to
          the presented article, and which he/she had to code, or an
          additional discussion of a close topic. In most
          cases, the material was drawn from articles that appeared in
          the Computer Recreations section of the Scientific American
          magazine.

          We had eleven meeting as in addition to the students'
          presentations, there was an introductory session, in which I
          presented the subject of AL, its place in the developing new
          trends in computer science, its relevant to Neural Networks,
          (which was the AI seminar of the previous year, and the
          class lecture of the following year), and selected
          philosophical and ethical problems that are an integral part
          of the subject. This lecture was based mainly on Langton:
          "Artificial Life" from AL-I.

          I have also had a quest speaker. Dr. Yuval Davidor from the
          Weizmann Institute of Science, lectured about Genetic
          Algorithms, and distributed a reprint of his article: "An
          Intuitive Introduction to Genetic Algorithms as Adaptive
          Optimization Procedures".


          The nine (double) assignments were:

          (All articles, unless specified otherwise, were from
           Artificial Life I)

          (SA-CR stands for: Scientific American/Computer Recreations.
           All of these articles can also be found in the two books
           published by Dewdney: "The Armchair Universe" and "The Magic
           Machine")

          The students were also referred to complimentary books, for
          further enhancements of relevant topics:

          Pagles - The Dreams of Reason
          Minsky - The Society of Mind

          In a future note, I will provide, an annotated bibliography
          of the books mentioned above and additional ones, from which
          material could be selected for similar seminars.

          Now that we have "Artificial Life -II", and Valera's:
          "Toward a practice of an autonomous system (European
          Artificial Life - I)", we have a more comprehensive
          selection from which we could offer a better balanced
          seminar.

       --------------------------

       There are so many books dealing with the creation of life, either
       biological or robotics, the techniques, the ethics and the
       outcomes, that it would be meaningless to list them all, or to dare
       to select the "best".
       Nevertheless, some are listed below.

    *  The legend about Pygmalion and Galatea

    *  Gershon Winkler - The Golem of Prague, The Judaica Press, New York,
                        1980

    *  Mary Shelly: Frankenstein

    *  Carlo Collodi: Pinocchio

    *  E. T. A. Hoffmann: Erzahlungen (i.e The Sandman, which served as the
                basis for Offenbach's Opera : Les Contes D'Hoffmann, in
                which appears Olympia - a mechanical doll.)

    *  Olaf Stapleoon: Last and First Men

    *  Carl Capeck: R.V.R

    *  Luis Borges: Many short stories (e.g. Funes the Memorious, The
                  Circular Ruins, The Immortals, ...)

    *  Issac assimov: The robot stories (e.g. I robot)

    *  Clifford Simack: City

    *  Ridley Scott(director): Blade Runner (movie)

           Outlines of Seminar # 2 in Artificial Life
           ------------------------------------------

           In a previous note (5 July 1992) I outlined the seminar I
           conducted during 1990-1991, at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.
           During the first semester of this academic year (1992-1993)
           I have conducted the second Seminar for graduate students.

           The seminar was conducted along much the same line, and 
you
           will be able to find its structure in the previous note. The
           major difference was that this time we used "Artificial Life
           II". Therefore the key topics were concerned with Genetic
           Algorithms, rather then Cellular Automata, which was the
           dominating topic of  Artificial Life I", and the first
           seminar.

           I assume that a more balanced approach is needed, and any
           subsequent seminar (or course) will try to balance more
           thoroughly the topics.

           After my Introduction lecture about AL, the assignments
           were:

           1. John Holland - Genetic Algorithm, Scientific American,
              July 1992.

              Daniel Hillis - Co-Evolving Improve Simulated Evolution
              as an Optimization Procedure (Al-II)

           2. Richard Belew, ... - Evolving Networks: Using the
              Genetic Algorithm with Connectionist Learning

           ** (Student 1 & 2 had also to code (together) a computer
              program based on Dewdney's article in Scientific
              American, November 1985: "Exploring the field of genetic
              algorithms in a primordial computer sea full of flibs")

           3. David Jefferson, ... - Evolution as a Theme in Artificial
              Life: The Genesys/Tracker System (AL-II)

           4. Robert Collins, ... - Ant Farm: Towards Simulated
              Evolution

           ** (Student 3 & 4 had also to code (together) a computer
              program based on Dewdney's article in Scientific
              American, December 1984: "Sharks and fish wage an
              ecological war on the toroidal planet Wa-Tor")

           5. Mark Bedau, ... - Measurement of Evolutionary Activity,
              Teleology, and Life (AL-II)

           6. John Koza - Genetic Evolution and Co-Evolution of

              for social equilibrium at a computer party")

           7. Thomas Ray - An Approach to the Synthesis of Life

              bacteria")

              the students the Tierra program)

           9. Steen Rasmussen, ... - Dynamics of Programmable Matter
              (AL-II)

           ** (Student 9 had also to code a computer program based on
              Dewdney's article  "A computer grid illustrates social
              networks and epidemics" in Algorithms, issue 2.3, May
              1991

          10. David Ackley, ... - Interaction between Learning &
              Evolution (AL-II)

           ** (Student 10 had also to code a computer program based on
              Dewdney's article  "Bringing tur-mites to life" in
              Algorithms, issue  1.7, November 1990


         **** In addition the students were invited to my house where I
              showed them  the "Artificial Life II - Video Proceedings"



           Bibliography: Additions
           -----------------------

           In my note from 11 September 1992, I supplied quite an
           extensive bibliography relating to AL.

           I feel that the following books should also be included:



           Philip N. Johnson-Laird: The Computer and the Mind, An
           Introduction to Cognitive Science, Harvard University Press,
           Cambridge, 1988

           Keith Campbell: Body and Mind, MacMillan Press, London 
1970

           Daniel C. Dennet: Brainstorms - Philosophical Essays on Mind
           and Psychology, The MIT Press, 1991

           Arthur C. Clarke: Childhood's End
