"Artificial Life" (ALife) is a name being given to theoretical, 
mathematical,
and computational studies of phenomena commonly associated with 
"life," such as
replication, metabolism, morphogenesis, evolution, and adaptation, 
which rely
heavily on computer representation and simulation. ALife is the 
newest example
of what Herbert Simon called "the sciences of the artificial." Artificial 
Life
is to life what Artificial Intelligence is to intelligence.

Although it is too early to tell if the research activities subsumed 
under
ALife will crystalize as a distinct field, these activities are of 
considerable
interest; consider, e.g., the use of cellular automata as a modeling
methodology, the application of evolutionary and ecological ideas in
computational methods, advances in the generation and 
representation of form,
the phenomenon of computer viruses, the variety of simulation 
packages for
computational biology, etc.

As Christopher Langton, one of the founders of this field, writes: 
"Artificial
Life ... complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with 
the
analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life-like 
behaviors
within computers and other artificial media. By extending the 
empirical
foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbon chain life 
that has
evolved on Earth, Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology 
by
locating life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-
could-be."
(C. Langton, Center for Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos National 
Laboratory)

The course will sample the research literature in this field, and will 
be
organized in a seminar format.
