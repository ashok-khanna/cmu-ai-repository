<H2>UCPOP: Partial Order Planner</H2>
<pre>

<listing>
This directory contains UCPOP, a domain independent partial order
planner that handles an expressive action representation (conditional
effects, universally quantified effects, and universally quantified
preconditions and goals.  UCPOP is both complete and sound.

UCPOP operates with actions that have conditional effects, universally
quantified preconditions and effects, and accepts universally
quantified goals, in addition to disjunction, negation, and
existential quantification.  With a conservative search strategy
UCPOP is both sound and complete for this representation. 

The Common Lisp implementation is quite efficient requiring between
5-50ms to explore and refine a partial plan. In particular, UCPOP is
as fast as or faster than SNLP in comparable domains. (UCPOP is upward
compatible with SNLP.) Instructors interested in using UCPOP in a
classroom setting will be happy to note that the UCPOP code is
exceptionally clean and only slightly larger than SNLP. It also has a
CLIM-based graphical plan-space browser, a user's manual, and a
large set of domain theories and search functions for testing.
