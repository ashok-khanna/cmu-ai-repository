Summary:      Nonlinear planning with abstraction

Version:      v93 (19-APR-93)

Description: 

   ABTWEAK is a complete hierarchical, non-linear planner that extends
   David Chapman's (MIT 1986) TWEAK planner as described by 
   Yang (Waterloo) and Tenenberg (Rochester) in 1989.  This implementation
   by Steven Woods (1991 Masters Thesis) includes a complete search
   strategy suited to abstraction hierarchies known as LEFT-WEDGE
   (Woods 1991). This planner and related work predates that of SNLP. 

   The planning language is the first order predicate logic
   without quantifiers and logical connectives.  Given an initial state
   description and a goal state description, represented as sets of
   literals, it finds a partially ordered, least-committed set of
   operators to achieve the goal.  It is correct in that every solution
   plan found necessarily solves the goal from the initial state, and
   complete in that it will terminate with a solution if one exists.
