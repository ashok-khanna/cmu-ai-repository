This directory contains the material discussed below. For more information 
please contact Steven Woods at woods@drev.dnd.ca

PLEASE let me know if you FTP a copy of the planner (or one of the papers) so
that I can maintain a  list of people who may be using it.  I will be letting
these people know of future releases or related papers that may become
available.

NOTE...

For an introduction into what AbTweak is, refer to Yang and Tenenberg's work
in AbTweak: Abstracting a Nonlinear, Least Commitment Planner, in 
Proceedings of the AAAI90. 

And of course, for even more background refer to David Chapman's work,
Planning for Conjunctive Goals, in AI Journal volume 32, pages 333-377, 1987.
