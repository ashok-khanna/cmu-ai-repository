The Strips software is available via anonymous ftp at

	sauquoit.gsfc.nasa.gov


While there is no promise of formal software support,
periodic updates will be placed in the ftp directory.
Bug reports, comments, suggestions, etc. should be sent to

	idm-users@dunloggin.gsfc.nasa.gov

If there is enough interest in starting a bulletin board,
send email to this account.

Finally, as is the tradition with shareware, we hope that various
developers will contribute to this code over time.  We promise to make
every new release available at this location.  In fact, the next
planned release will follow the Fikes paper and is planned for release
in a few months.


HAPPY PLANNING,

Nick Short
