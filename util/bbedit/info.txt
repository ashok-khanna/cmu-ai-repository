Text Editors vs. Word Processors
==== ======= === ==== ==========
 
Many people consider that text editors and word processors are
actually the same type of application, differing mainly on the basis
of size and cost. There are, however, a number of practical features
which affect how a given program should be categorized.
 
Text editors are applications which are used strictly for editing and
transforming text. In this context, "text" means a document which
contains any arbitrary combination of characters, including letters,
numbers, punctuation marks, and other symbols. Some examples include
PostScript text files, BinHex or uuencoded data files, program source
code files, or documents such as this one. The functional emphasis for
a text editor is on manipulation of characters and lines (often within
very large files), rather than words or other units of written
language. This of course does not imply that text editors cannot or
should not have word-oriented functions as well, but rather that they
must handle a variety of arbitrary types of file content which word
processors are not optimized for.
 
A text editor does not commonly incorporate extensive formatting
options, as its goal is to manipulate files which will be employed or
passed on in digital form (e.g. as ASCII files, or as input to some
external formatting or processing program). Thus, provisions for
external interactions with programming environments or similar tools
are also common among text editors.
 
In contrast, word processors are applications optimized and primarily
used for preparing and formatting documents for printed output. In
keeping with the nature of printed documents, word processing programs
naturally focus on language elements such as words, paragraphs, and
sentences, and on providing extensive sets of formatting options to
aid in the production of printed output.
 
In principle, word processors can provide many of the text
manipulation features of text editors. In practice, text editors are
leaner and meaner: they enjoy much smaller footprints (in other words,
they take up less space, both on the disk and in RAM), and are faster
at display and scrolling than word processors. They contain features
that most word processors don't have, such as multi-file search and
replace, line-oriented text manipulation, and even more. They are
ideal tools for programming, telecommunications, cross-platform text
transfer, data analysis, and simple composition (such as the file
you're reading now).
 
BBEdit is a text editor.
 
 
Why BBEdit is so Cool
=== ====== == == ====
 
Most text editors are capable tools. BBEdit is a power tool:
 
	-	Integrated support for THINK C(tm) and Symantec C++.
			(THINK C/Symantec C++ version 6.0 or later required)
	-	Support for MPW(r)'s ToolServer.
	-	Support for the MPW "411" on-line Macintosh
			programming reference.
	-	Importing and Exporting of foreign file formats via
			Claris XTND(tm).
	-	Disk and Glossary Browsers.
	-	Ability to read THINK C, THINK Pascal, and Code
		Warrior projects for browsing and searching.
	-	Support for On Location(tm) for text searches.
	-	Multi-file search and replace.
	-	Built-in Compare utility.
	-	Automatic line feed translation.
	-	Stationery documents.
	-	Ability to open multiple files with one command.
	-	Pattern ("grep") searching.
	-	System 7 savvy; System 6 friendly.
	-	A/UX(tm) 3.0 compatible.
 
Here's what some of the critics have to say about BBEdit:
 
	"It doesn't suck."
		- Leonard Rosenthol, Director of Advanced Technology,
			Aladdin Systems.
			
	"It has that, as the French say, 'I don't know what'".
		-  Keith Rollin, co-author, Macintosh Programming Secrets
		
	"It's the feel-good hit of the summer".
		-  Phil Shapiro, Software Engineer, Symantec Corporation
	
	"BBEdit provides much functionality in an uncluttered
		interface that belies its power." -	TidBITS #202
		
BBEdit 2.5 has been designated a Finalist for the 1993 MacUser Editors'
Choice Awards in the category of Best New Development Tool.
 
Why not use Another Text Editor?
=== === === ======= ==== =======
 
There are many reasons:
 
	-	None of them are as well-supported as BBEdit. Others
		go years between maintenance versions and major releases;
		we continually maintain and enhance BBEdit to meet our
		customers' needs.
	
	-	None of them work as smoothly with your chosen development
		tools (THINK C/Symantec C++, THINK Reference 2.0, or MPW
		ToolServer) as BBEdit does.
	
	-	None of them can read or search THINK C, THINK Pascal,
		and Code Warrior project documents.
		
	-	None of them support the Claris XTND mechanism.
	
	-	Or On Location.
		
	-	Or have any neat features like disk browsers.
	
	-	Or support for Balloon Help.
	
And the list goes on.
 
BBEdit has been around for a while, and continues to support its
installed base. And it promises to keep on doing so. Let's face it:
there are old text editors, and there are bold text editors, but there
are no old, bold text editors.
