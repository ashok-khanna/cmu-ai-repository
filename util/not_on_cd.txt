Most files in the CMU AI Repository also appear on the Prime Time Freeware
for AI CD-ROM publication.

In general, the only files that don't appear on the CD are:

   +  Files with export restrictions, such as implementations of
      cryptographic algorithms

   +  Files of a time dependent nature, such as calendar of events

   +  Files which the authors didn't want to appear on the CD, for
      whatever reason (very few of these).

   +  Files added to the repository since the CD was pressed. Of course,
      such files will appear on the next CD.
