Daydreamer: A computer model of the stream of thought

This is Common Lisp code for the Daydreamer program
developed at UCLA from 1984 to 1988. It implements the
following:

  - daydreaming goals: strategies for what to think about

  - emotional control of thought: triggering and direction
    of processing by emotions

  - hierarchical planning: achieving a goal by breaking it
    down into subgoals

  - analogical planning (chunking): storing successful plans
    and adapting them to future problems

  - episode indexing and retrieval: mechanisms for indexing
    and retrieval of cases

  - serendipity detection and application: a mechanism for
    recognizing and exploiting accidental relationships among
    problems

  - action mutation: a strategy for generating new
    possibilities when the system is stuck
