I.  Special Considerations 
==========================

The AT-2500TX supports autonegotiation. If the connected 
device does not support autonegotiation, you must select 
the port settings. In this case, refer to the "Connection 
speed and duplex" information file. 

Configuration of the AT-2500TX resources is under PCI 
control. For most applications, no setup other than normal 
installation of the network software is necessary. To 
change port settings, to manually view the card's 
configuration or to run Diagnostics, use the CardAssistant 
setup program, SETUP25.EXE. 

The SETUP25 utility only runs on DOS. To enter 
DOS mode in Windows 9x, reboot and press F8 when the 
"Starting Windows 9x" message appears. Select the Command 
prompt only option (#6).

To de-install the drivers, use the remove driver option 
from your Windows 9x Network Control Panel. See 
"IV. Removing an Existing Driver".


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\A25v3m4.SYS (NDIS4 driver)*
\NETATI25.INF (OEM setup file for Windows 95b/95c/98)
\NDIS5\A25v3m5.SYS (NDIS5 driver)*
\NETATI25.INF (OEM setup file for Windows 98)
\NDIS3\A25V3m.SYS (NDIS3 driver)*
\NDIS3\NETATI25.INF (OEM setup file for Windows 95/95a)
\INFO\WIN95_98.TXT (this file)

*NOTE: Use the NDIS4 driver for Win 95 build 950b and 
greater and for Win 98. Use the NDIS3 driver for Win 95 
build 950a or lower. The NDIS5 driver can be used instead
of the NDIS4 driver with Win 98. (You can check the Windows 
release number in the System Properties dialog box, General 
tab.)


III. Automatically Installing the AT-2500.
===============================================

1. Start Windows with no AT-2500 installed in the 
   system.  Use Windows "Run" command from the Start
   menu and type in "A:\winprep".  Winprep will copy
   the NDIS drivers and configuration files to the 
   appropriate directories.

2. Power down the system, installed the NIC and reboot.  
   During system boot the NIC will be automatically 
   detected and the correct NDIS version installed.  
   This is a function of ATINDI.DLL where
   the correct NDIS version is matched with the 
   appropriate operating system version.  After the 
   driver is loaded the system will required a reboot.
 
3. If the auto-NDIS version is not preferred, the user
   may go into the NIC advance properties and
   select the desired NDIS driver.  However, Windows 
   95, 95a will not accept anything higher than NDIS3  
   and Windows 95b nothing higher than NDIS4.


IV. Manually installing the AT-2500 with Windows 9x
===========================================

1. With Windows 9x installed as per Microsoft installation 
   instructions, shutdown Windows 9x, power off your 
   computer.

2. Following the instructions in your computer manual for 
   PCI card installation, install your AT-2500 card, and 
   reboot your system.

3. Have the Windows 9x setup CD-ROM disc or floppy 
   diskette(s) available. You will be called on to copy 
   support files for networking. 

4. Windows 9x finds the PCI adapter card. The new hardware 
   found message appears, and you are prompted for the 
   driver.

5. Insert the Allied Telesyn CardAssistant diskette in the 
   floppy drive. A dialog box prompts for a source, 
   proposing "A:\". (If you are running Windows 95, which 
   driver to use depends on which build of Windows 95 you 
   have. If you are not sure which build you have, you can 
   check the release number in the System Properties 
   dialog box, General tab.) If you are running Windows 98 
   or Windows 95 build 950b and greater, the correct 
   driver (NDIS4) is in the root directory. If the NDIS5
   driver is desired for Windows 98, select a:\ndis5.  
   For Win 95 build 950a or lower, use the NDIS3 driver: 
   in the source dialog box, type "A:\NDIS3" to point 
   Windows to the NDIS3 driver. 

   Click OK.

6. When prompted by Windows 9x, insert the Windows 
   installation media. 

7. Reboot the computer into Windows 9x as prompted. Remove 
   the CardAssistant diskette from the drive and click Yes. 
   Windows 9x will complete the driver installation process.


V. Removing an Existing Driver
===============================

1. From the "My Computer" icon, choose "Control Panel". 
   Then choose "Network".

2. From the "Network" dialog box, select the adapter to 
   remove. Then choose "Remove".

3. Do Not Shutdown or Restart Windows 9x at this time. 
   To install the AT-2500 driver, complete the steps listed 
   in section III.


VI. How to See MAC Address
=========================

To determine a MAC address for a card:

1. Boot the computer into DOS with no drivers loaded. To 
   enter DOS mode in Windows 9x, reboot and press F8 when 
   the "Starting Windows 9x" message appears. Select the 
   Command prompt only option (#6).

2. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in the floppy drive 
   and launch SETUP25: type a:\setup25.

3. The main screen shows a table listing the AT-2500 Fast 
   Ethernet cards installed in the computer. Write down the 
   address(es) listed in the "MAC" column of the table.
