Installing an AT-2500 Fast Ethernet adapter in a PCI slot
=========================================================
Warning
High voltages inside the computer present a safety hazard. 
Make sure the power is off before removing the cover. This 
LAN adapter card is for use only with IBM or compatible UL-
listed personal computers that have installation 
instructions detailing installation of card-cage 
accessories. Installation should be performed with 
precautions to prevent damage to static-sensitive 
components.

1.  With power off, put the adapter in the computer.

2.  Start the computer. In most cases, the PCI computer 
    automatically configures the adapter.  See the next 
    section if you have trouble and must do some manual
    configuration.


If you have problems
====================

ATI has found that some PCI computers require additional 
configuration to install a PCI adapter. Follow these steps 
to complete the installation:

1.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS version for your 
    computer.

Contact your computer's manufacturer to make sure you're 
using the latest BIOS. Here are the phone numbers for the 
top PCI computer manufacturers:

Company            Phone         
----------------   -------------
ALR               (800) 257-1230
Ambra             (800) 465-2227
AST               (800) 727-1278
Compaq            (800) 652-6672
Dell              (800) 626-4308
                  (800) 624-9896

ZEOS              (800) 554-7172
                  (800) 228-5390


2.  Make sure the BIOS is set up correctly.

In some PCI computers, you may need to enable the PCI slot 
using the "CMOS" or "BIOS" Setup program. 

After installing the adapter, turn on the computer and 
enter the "CMOS" or "BIOS" Setup program during system 
initialization (usually by pressing F1, F2, Ctrl-Alt-INS, 
Ctrl-Alt-Esc, or Ctrl-Alt-S). The key you press is usually 
shown on the screen.

Once in Setup, find the entry for PCI slots.  Set these 
parameters:

PCI Slot#:     Slot where the adapter is installed (1-3) 
Master:        ENABLED
Slave:         ENABLED
Latency Timer: 40
Interrupt:     Choose an IRQ.
Edge-level:    Level

The exact wording of the parameters varies with different 
computers.

Save the changes, exit Setup, and continue with the 
installation.
