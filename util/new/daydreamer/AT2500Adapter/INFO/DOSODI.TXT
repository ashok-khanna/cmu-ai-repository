I.  Special Considerations
==========================

NOTE: YOU CANNOT GENERATE THE MONOLITHIC "IPX.COM" FILE 
      USING "WSGEN" OR "SHGEN" WITH OUR DRIVERS - USE THE 
      IPXODI DRIVERS INSTEAD.

Any version of NetWare can support an ODI driver.
 
Configuration of the AT-2500TX is under PCI control, and 
the AT-2500TX is NWAY capable. For most applications, no 
setup other than normal installation of the network 
software is necessary. For any half-duplex application, the 
card by default auto-detects the speed of the link (10 Mbps 
or 100 Mbps). If the connection is full-duplex without NWAY 
capability, you must select one of the full-duplex settings.
In this case, refer to the "Connection speed and duplex" 
information file. 

In PCI machines with the PCI 2 bus, the processor may cycle 
indefinitely through the bootup process if the adapter card 
is not installed but the driver is loaded. This can happen 
if the adapter card has been removed from the computer, yet 
the driver files are still loaded. Since it is not always 
possible to determine if you are running a PCI 1 vs a PCI 2 
bus on your processor, do not allow the driver to load if
the AT-2500 is not present in the system.


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================
\DOSODI\NET.CFG
\DOSODI\LSL.COM
\DOSODI\IPXODI.COM
\DOSODI\NETX.COM
\DOSODI\a25odi.COM    DOS ODI client driver 
\INFO\DOSODI.TXT      This file 


III.  Installing the AT-2500 DOS ODI driver using the DOS 
     Requester installation from Novell
=========================================================

1. Insert the Novell Workstation Installation diskette 
   "WS_DOS1" into a floppy drive and run "Install".

2. Select the appropriate options for your system such as
   altering startup files, Windows support, etc. 

3. In the appropriate section, supply the path to the ODI 
   drivers provided on the CardAssistant diskette:

       A:\DOSODI

   The AT-2500 should appear in the "Insert the Driver 
   Disk" menu. Select the driver and press ENTER.

4.   Continue installation.


IV.  Installing the AT-2500 DOS ODI driver manually
===================================================

1. Copy the contents of the DOS directory of the 
   CardAssistant diskette to a directory you specify, 
   i.e. C:\NET.

2. Check the NET.CFG file to make sure the first frame type 
   listed under the LINK DRIVER section matches the frame 
   type the server is using. If you don't know, go to the 
   file server console and type CONFIG. This will should the
   driver information for the server, including which frame
   types are available.

3. Modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT (or batch file that loads the 
   Novell drivers) to contain the following lines in this 
   order:

     LSL
     a25odi
     IPXODI
     NETX (or VLM)

4. When using NETX.EXE, Check the CONFIG.SYS file in the root
   directory of drive C: for a LASTDRIVE statement. If there is
   none, the first network drive will be F:. Otherwise, the first 
   network drive will be the next letter after the one 
   specified by LASTDRIVE. Otherwise, make sure that LASTDRIVE
   is set to Z when using VLMs, and that the NET.CFG specifies
   the first network driver under the Novell DOS Requester section.

   Also, if you have a PCI-1 bus in your system, add 
   the line BUSTYPE PCI1 to the NET.CFG file, i.e. 

     LINK DRIVER a25odi
          BUSTYPE PCI1

   Otherwise the driver may not find the card. If you don't 
   know which bus you have, try loading without the option. 
   If it loads, you don't need it.

5. Reboot your computer by pressing the reset button, or by 
   turning the power switch off and on. Do NOT use 
   <Ctrl>+<Alt>+<Delete>. Some PCI systems do not reset 
   bus-mastering cards with a warm boot.

             SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILES - ODI
             --------------------------------

CONFIG.SYS
----------
BUFFERS=30,0
FILES=45
DOS=HIGH,UMB
LASTDRIVE=Z 

Note: Set LASTDRIVE=Z only when using VLMs. The Novell
DOS workstation installation will automatically set it
for you. When using NETX, the first network drive is the
next letter after the LASTDRIVE setting in the CONFIG.SYS.

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------
PATH C:\DOS
PROMPT $P$G
CD \NET
LSL
a25odi
IPXODI
NETX
F:
LOGIN SERVER/USERNAME

STARTNET.BAT (DOS Requester - VLMs)
-----------------------------------
@ECHO OFF
CD \NWCLIENT
SET NWLANGUAGE=ENGLISH
LSL
a25odi
IPXODI
VLM
CD \

NET.CFG (VLMs)
--------------
LINK DRIVER a25odi
      FRAME ETHERNET_802.2

NETWARE DOS REQUESTER
      FIRST NETWORK DRIVE = F      

NET.CFG (NETX)
--------------
LINK DRIVER a25odi
      FRAME ETHERNET_802.2


V. Removing an existing driver 
===============================

To de-install the driver, remove the driver from the 
STARTNET.BAT or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or comment it out, 
and reboot.


VI. Finding the MAC Address
==========================

To determine the MAC address assigned to the NIC:

1. Boot the computer into DOS with no drivers loaded.

2. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in the floppy drive 
   and launch SETUP25: type a:\setup25.

3. The main screen shows a table listing the AT-2500
   cards installed in the computer. Write down the 
   address(es) listed in the "MAC" column of the table.
