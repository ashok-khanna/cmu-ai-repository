I. Special Considerations
=========================

The AT-2500TX supports autonegotiation. If the connected 
device does not support autonegotiation, you must select 
the port settings. In this case, refer to the "Connection 
speed and duplex" information file. 

Configuration of the AT-2500TX resources is under PCI 
control. For most applications, no setup other than normal 
installation of the network software is necessary. To 
change port settings, to manually view the card's 
configuration or to run Diagnostics, use the CardAssistant 
setup program, SETUP25.EXE. 

The SETUP25 utility only runs on DOS. If you do not have 
a DOS boot partition on your Windows NT drive, boot DOS 
from floppy. 

To de-install the driver, use the remove driver option from 
your Windows NT Network Control Panel. See "IV. Removing 
an Existing Driver".


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\A25v3m4.SYS (NDIS4 driver)*
\OEMSETNT.INF (OEM setup file for NT 4.0 and greater)
\NDIS3\A25v3m.SYS (NDIS3 driver)*
\NDIS3\OEMSETNT.INF (OEM setup file for NT 3.51)
\INFO\WINNT.TXT (this file)

*NOTE: Use the NDIS3 driver for Windows NT version 3.51. 
Use the NDIS4 driver for Windows NT 4.0 and greater. If 
you are running version 3.1, you must upgrade your copy 
of Windows NT. (You can check the Windows release 
number in the System Properties dialog box, General tab.)

III. Installing the Miniport Driver
===================================

If you are installing multiple adapter cards in a single, 
computer, complete the installation process for each card. 

1. If the AT-2500 adapter card is already installed, reboot 
   into Windows NT. If you have not installed the AT-2500 
   adapter card into your computer, shutdown the computer, 
   turn it off and unplug it. Install the card by following 
   the instructions that came with your computer. Then turn 
   the computer on again. Boot into Windows NT.

2. Double-click the Network icon in the Control Panel.

3. NT 4.0:  Select the Adapters tab; click the Add button.
            From the Select Network Adapter pop-up window,
            do not select from the Network Adapter list; 
            choose the Have Disk button.
   NT 3.5x: From the Network Adapter Card drop-down list in 
            the Add Network Adapter dialog box, choose 
            "<OTHER> Requires Disk from Manufacturer." Then 
            click Continue.  
 
4. NT 4.0:  Insert the CardAssistant diskette into your 
            floppy disk drive; make sure a:\ appears in the 
            text field and click OK.
   NT 3.5x: Insert the CardAssistant diskette into your 
            floppy disk drive; type "a:\NDIS3" in the text 
            field and click OK.

5. Verify that "ATI 2500 Fast Ethernet card" appears in 
   the Choose OEM Option dialog box. Then click OK.

6. In the Network Settings dialog box, verify that "ATI 
   2500 Fast Ethernet" card appears in the "Installed 
   Adapter Cards" list. Then click OK.

7. This completes the card installation. Click OK. Windows 
   NT prompts you to configure the protocols you will be 
   using for network communications.

8. From the Network Settings Change dialog box, click 
   Restart Now.


IV. Removing an Existing Driver
===============================

If any drivers need to be removed from your existing 
installation, remove them first, shutdown the NT operating 
system and reboot.

1. Double-Click the Network icon in the Control Panel.

2. NT 4.0:  Select the Adapters tab. Select the adapter to 
            remove. Then  choose "Remove".
   NT 3.5x: From the "Network Settings" dialog box, select 
            the adapter to remove. Then choose "Remove".
   
3. From the "Network Settings" dialog box, verify that the 
   selected adapter has been removed from the "Installed 
   Adapter Cards" list. Then choose "OK".

4. From the "Network Settings Change" dialog box, choose 
   "Restart Now".

5. After the Windows NT operating system shuts down, turn 
   the power switch off and on.

6. Log on to Windows NT. 

7. Follow the "New or Additional Installation" section of 
   this file to install your AT-2500 Fast Ethernet Adapter.
