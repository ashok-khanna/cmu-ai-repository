I.  Special Considerations
==========================

Configuration of the AT-2500TX is under PCI control, and 
the AT-2500TX is NWAY capable. For most applications, no 
setup other than normal installation of the network 
software is necessary. For any half-duplex application, the 
card by default auto-detects the speed of the link (10 Mbps 
or 100 Mbps). If the connection is full-duplex without NWAY 
capability, you must select one of the full-duplex settings.
In this case, refer to the "Connection speed and duplex" 
information file. 


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\OEMSETUP.INF   (Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup 
                      information file)
\A25v3.DOS   (NDIS 2.0 Driver)
\A25v3.386   (NDIS ENHANCED DRIVER)
\A25ODI.COM   (ODI type driver)
\INFO\WFW311.TXT   (this file)


III.  Installing NDIS3, NDIS2, ODI Drivers
==========================================

1.  From the "Network" group in Program Manager, choose 
    "Network Setup".

2.  In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "Networks".

3.  In the "Networks" dialog box, verify that "Install 
    Microsoft Windows Network" is selected. Then choose 
    "OK".

4.  In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "Sharing".

5.  In the "Sharing" dialog box, select whether to allow 
    file and/or printer sharing with other users.

6.  In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "Drivers". 
    Then, in the "Network Drivers" dialog box, choose "Add 
    Adapter".

7.  In the "Add Network Adapter" dialog box, select 
    "Unlisted or Updated Network Adapter". Then choose "OK".

8.  Insert the AT-2500 CardAssistant diskette into your 
    floppy drive. Then, in the text box of the "Install 
    Driver" dialog box, type: a:\ and choose OK.

9.  In the "Network Adapters" list of the "Unlisted or 
    Updated Network Adapter" dialog box, verify that "ATI 
    AT2500 Fast Ethernet" is highlighted. Then choose "OK".

10. In the "Network Drivers" dialog box, verify that "ATI 
    AT2500 [NDIS2/NDIS3]" and its default protocols, 
    "Microsoft NetBEUI" and "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport 
    with NetBIOS", appear in the "Network Drivers" list. 
    Then choose "Close".

11. In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "OK".

12. If prompted, insert the required Windows for Workgroups 
    diskette(s) into your floppy drive and then choose "OK".
    (WFW occasionally loses its place at this point; if you 
    get a message from Windows that it can't find a file, 
    try inserting WFW install diskettes 7 and 8.)

13. If prompted, reinsert the CardAssistant diskette into 
    your floppy drive. In the text box of the "Install 
    Driver" dialog box, choose "OK".

14. From the "Windows Setup" dialog box, choose "Restart 
    Computer".

Note: These are the default values for installation. If 
      you are adding any TCP/IP software, this 
      configuration will satisfy the NDIS 2.0 requirements 
      of TCP/IP systems. 


IV. Removing an Existing Driver
===============================

IMPORTANT - If you have already installed Windows for 
Workgroups and the A25v3.DOS NDIS driver, follow the 
numbered steps in this section.

The initial installation copies the OEMSETUP.INF to your 
WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. It renames the file to OEMx.INF, 
where x is a number starting with 0 for drivers that are 
not shipped with Windows for Workgroups; this also pertains 
to video and printer drivers.

1. Click on the Network Icon in the Network Control panel.
   Select the "Drivers" button in the Network Setup, select 
   the "Remove" button, then select "Yes" when asked if you
   want to remove the driver.  

2. Delete the OEMx.INF file(s) from the WINDOWS\SYSTEM 
   directory, where is the number corresponding to the 
   OEM file for the AT-2500 driver. Otherwise, Windows for 
   Workgroups will not allow any upgrades or changes to 
   existing drivers. If you have installed only one other 
   driver, the file has the following name:

   OEM0.INF     609 bytes     8/11/93

   If you are not sure if which OEMx.INF file to delete, 
   use a text editor to view the file. It will contain 
   references to ATI.

   All references to the AT2500 driver in the "Network
   Setup", "Drivers" dialog box will have been removed.


V.  Adding Novell NetWare 3.x or 4.x with IPXODI Support
========================================================

With IPXODI Support For NetWare 3.x
-----------------------------------

1. Make a directory on your hard drive (e.g.; C:\ATINET), 
   copy the contents of the \DOSODI directory on your 
   AT2500 CardAssistant diskette to the directory you 
   created. (The \DOSODI directory on the CardAssistant 
   diskette contains the ODI drivers.)

2. Verify that the ODI drivers for the AT-2500 Ethernet 
   Adapter Card are NOT loaded before setting up Windows 
   for Workgroups.

3. Start Windows. Then, from the "Network" group, choose 
   "Network Setup".

4. In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "Networks".

5. In the "Networks" dialog box, select "Install Microsoft 
   Windows Network" and then select "Other".

6. From the "Other" drop down list, select "Novell NetWare 
   (Workstation Shell 3.X)". Then choose "OK".

7. In the "Novell NetWare" dialog box, select "IPXODI.COM 
   and LSL.COM (recommended). Then choose "OK".

8. In the "Network Drivers" dialog box, verify that "ATI 
   AT2500 [ODI/NDIS2]" and its default protocols, 
   "Microsoft NetBEUI" and "IPX/SP Compatible Transport 
   with NetBIOS", appear in the "Network Drivers" list. 
   Then Choose "OK".   

9. When asked if you want to modify the net.cfg file, 
   you can enter the path to the directory created earlier 
   for your ODI files (e.g.;C:\ATINET). After you make 
   your changes, or if you do not want to make changes, 
   choose "OK".

10. From the "Windows Setup" dialog box, choose "Continue".

11. EDIT the Autoexec.bat file by inserting the following 
    file references BEFORE C:\WINDOWS\odihlp.exe:

    c:\atinet\lsl
    c:\atinet\a25odi
    c:\atinet\ipxodi
    c:\atinet\netx

12. Exit Windows and re-boot your PC by turning power OFF 
    then ON.

With IPXODI Support For NetWare 4.x
-----------------------------------

1. Verify that the ODI drivers for the AT-2500 Ethernet 
   Adapter Card are NOT loaded before setting up Windows 
   for Workgroups.

2. From the DOS command line, install the NetWare 
   DOS/Windows Client software. Select "Yes" to install 
   Windows support and then enter the path to your Windows 
   directory, for example, 

   C:\WINDOWS

3. Start Windows. Then, from the "Network" group, choose 
   "Network Setup".

4. In the "Network Setup" dialog box, choose "Networks".

5. In the "Networks" dialog box, select "Install Microsoft 
   Windows Network" and then select "Other".

6. From the "Other" drop down list, select "Novell NetWare 
   (Workstation Shell 4.0 and above)". Then choose "OK".

7. In the "Novell NetWare" dialog box, select "IPXODI.COM 
   and LSL.COM (recommended)". Then choose "OK".

8. In the "Network Drivers" dialog box, verify that "ATI 
   AT2500 family [ODI/NDIS2]" and its default protocols, 
   "Microsoft NetBEUI" and "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport 
   with NetBIOS", appear in the "Network Drivers" list. 
   Then choose "OK".

9. From the "Windows Setup" dialog box, choose "Restart 
   Computer".

Installing Novell NetWare 3.x and 4.x support adds the 
following lines to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

CONFIG.SYS
----------
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------
C:\WINDOWS\ODIHLP.EXE

Note: The sample AUTOEXEC.BAT shows VLM.EXE being used 
      instead of NETX.EXE. VLMs are required for 
      NetWare 4.x but may be an alternative to NETX with 
      NetWare 2.x and 3.x.
