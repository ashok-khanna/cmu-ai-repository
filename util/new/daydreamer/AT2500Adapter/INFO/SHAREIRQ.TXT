PCI Shared Interrupts

Shared interrupts are normal in PCI computers, but not all 
PCI device drivers support them. Although drivers for the 
ATI AT-2500 PCI adapter support shared interrupts, other 
PCI drivers used by your computer may not.

If you're having problems with a shared interrupt, try one 
of the following:

1.  Use your computer's BIOS setup program to change the 
    interrupt assigned to this adapter.

2.  Make sure that your AT-2500 PCI device driver loads
    AFTER the driver for any other device sharing this 
    interrupt.

3.  Contact the manufacturer of the other adapter or add-in 
    card that is sharing this interrupt for a new driver.
