Logic Programming Newsletter - SUBMISSIONS 
------------------------------------------

Issue 6/4 of the Newsletter is currently at the printers
and if you're a member of the Association of Logic Programming
(ALP) you should be receiving a copy in the next few weeks.

Never one to take a rest, I'm starting to gather contributions
for the next issue.

We'll print almost anything relevant to LP. For instance,
news on new products, abstracts, short notes on 
research (1-2 pages), your views on some aspect of LP,
trip reports, announcements of workshops,
conferences, meetings, etc.


The submission deadline is December 17th
                           -------------

Contributions are welcome by email, floppy disk (MAC or PC - please
include an ASCII version) or by mail for shorter contributions.
By ASCII, I mean plain text files - not LaTex please. 

There is a STRONG preference for material received via email or 
on disc - it saves a lot of retyping.
