AAAI's Mission and History

The American Association for Artificial Intelligence is
a nonprofit scientific society devoted to the promotion
and advancement of artificial intelligence--what
constitutes intelligent thought and behavior and how it
can be exhibited in computers. Membership is open to
anyone with an interest in AI research and development.
Periodicals and Journals

AI Magazine

Called the "journal of record for the AI community," AI
Magazine helps AAAI members stay abreast of significant
new research and literature across the entire field of
artificial intelligence. The quarterly publication
features timely, feature-length articles, consistently
crafted to be clear enough to permit specialists to
review work outside their particular area of expertise. 

The AI Directory

The AI Directory offers AAAI members a handy access
guide to their AI colleagues, companies, AI
consultants, libraries, and universities.


Journals

AAAI members can receive substantial discounts on a
number of journals in the AI field. Journals included
in this program include: Machine Learning, Artificial
Intelligence, and AI in Medicine Journal. 


Publications

AAAI Press books serve to keep AAAI members and the
scientific community abreast of breaking research in
AI. Members receive an annual catalog of AAAI Press
books, and are offered discounts on AAAI Press books at
the annual conference.

AAAI Press also makes selected workshop and symposia
papers available to members, through its Technical
Reports Series. This service provides members with
speedy access to state-of-the-art research in
fast-breaking AI subfields. Some papers are also
available even faster, through internet electronic
subscriptions.


Conferences

As a member of AAAI you will receive advance notice and
discounted registration fees for all of AAAI's
conferences, symposia, and other meetings.  The
National Conference on Artificial Intelligence AAAI's
summer national conference promotes theoretical and
applied AI research as well as intellectual interchange
among researchers and practitioners. The technical
program features substantial, original research and
practices. Conference panel discussions and invited
presentations identify significant social,
philosophical, and economic issues influencing AI's
development throughout the world.


Exhibit Program

AAAI's exhibits present the latest AI hardware,
software, consulting, publications, and services. Each
year, the exhibit program also features a special
event, such as the robot competition. Conference on
Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence 
AAAI's IAAI conference highlights innovative AI
applications that have been deployed worldwide.
Attendees view AI applications in use today, and learn
how these software systems are developed and
implemented. Industry experts also discuss successful
AI applications in interactive AI-On-Line panels.


Symposia

AAAI's Symposium Series affords participants a smaller,
more intimate setting where they can share ideas and
learn from each other's research.

Topics for the symposia change each year, and the
limited seating capacity and relaxed atmosphere allow
for workshop-like interaction. 


Workshops

AAAI workshops allow richer communications on basic and
applied research and engineering topics. AAAI members
receive advance notification of workshop topics as well
as an annual invitation to submit ideas for AAAI
sponsorship.


Tutorials

AAAI tutorials introduce attendees to evolving and
practical techniques in broad areas of artificial
intelligence. Attendees learn standard methods,
subtleties of the field, and a perspective on where it
is going. 


Subgroups

AAAI subgroups serve members with common interests in
medicine, manufacturing, law, and business. Some
subgroups publish newsletters for the benefit of
subgroup members.


Sponsored Activities, Grants, & Scholarships

As a part of its mission, AAAI sponsors, cosponsors,
and cooperates with many workshops, conferences, and
affiliated symposia throughout the world. AAAI members
receive information about many of these events through
AI Magazine. AAAI also sponsors a scholarship fund
enabling students to attend AAAI conferences and
symposia, and a grant program encouraging scientific
inquiry by women and minorities.
