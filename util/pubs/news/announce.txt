Archives of the AI-related newsgroups listed below can now be found in
appropriate subdirectories of
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/
Each of these newsgroups is being automatically archived on a weekly
basis.  For example, the gzipped tar file 94_10_08.tgz in the
comp.lang.lisp/ subdirectory contains all articles that appeared in the
comp.lang.lisp newsgroup during the previous week. Links to these
archives also exist in many of the topical directories of the CMU AI
Repository (e.g., /user/ai/lang/lisp/news/ contains links to
Lisp-related newsgroups).

The archives for most of the newsgroups start with articles appearing
on 23-JUL-94, which is when the newsgroup archiving software was first
tested. Some newsgroups, however, have archives that go back further
(sometimes with gaps) due to archives originally maintained elsewhere.
For example, the comp.lang.lisp archive includes articles from January
1990 through February 1992 in addition to the more recent archives.

The newsgroups being archived include: 

   comp.ai                        comp.lang.lisp 
   comp.ai.alife                  comp.lang.lisp.franz 
   comp.ai.edu                    comp.lang.lisp.mcl 
   comp.ai.fuzzy                  comp.lang.lisp.x 
   comp.ai.genetic                comp.lang.prolog 
   comp.ai.jair.announce          comp.lang.scheme 
   comp.ai.jair.papers            comp.lang.smalltalk 
   comp.ai.nat-lang               comp.object.logic 
   comp.ai.neural-nets            comp.org.lisp-users 
   comp.ai.nlang-know-rep         comp.robotics 
   comp.ai.philosophy             comp.speech 
   comp.ai.shells                 comp.std.lisp 
   comp.ai.vision                 comp.sys.ti.explorer 
   comp.constraints               comp.sys.xerox 
   comp.lang.clos                 sci.lang 
   comp.lang.dylan 

If there is sufficient demand, we will archive other newsgroups as
well. Comments and suggestions should be sent to
ai+news-archives@cs.cmu.edu.
