INTERNET NN APPLICATIONS LIST

A couple of weeks ago I posted a message to in newsgroup asking
people to tell me of any applications of neural networks which
they knew of, so that I could make a list of them for myself and
for other people to use.  The ambition is that this should be the
beginning of an increasingly comprehensive list which can help
people, with common areas of interest, to get in touch with one
another, and share their ideas and experiences.  I think that even
from this tentative start, this idea may already have been the
catalyst for some people to make connections.

The response has been quite good so far, and I hope that, by
posting the current list, I might inspire other people to write
to me so that I can add more to the list.

Here is the first alpha test version of the list:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

InterNet List of Neural Network Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VERSION 0.1

DESCRIPTION:
The following is a list of various applications for which neural networks have
been used.  Each entry consists of a one line description of the work, and an
E-mail address of a person who can be contacted for further information.
This person may or may not be the person who is doing the work.

REQUIREMENT:
The contact person must write to the list editor personally giving
permission for their address to be publicised in this list.

MORE APPLICATIONS WANTED:
Please write to the editor to get new applications entered in the list.

NOTE: If anyone could suggest a better way to classify the various
applications I would be most appreciative.

NOTE: If any of the wonderful people who have already written to me
feel that I have messed up the description of their work or other
details, could they please tell me - thanks.

APOLOGY: I was initially more broad in my request in that I did not ask
for the E-mail addresses of the researchers to be included.  Some people
wrote to me about other people's work, but I have not included this. Sorry
