   The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
   includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
   interface to the X window system. ARS MAGNA can be obtained by
   anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.yale.edu:/pub/nisp 
   as the file ars-magna.tar.Z. Installation instructions are in the file
   Installation.readme. The simulator is written in Nisp, a macro-package
   for Common Lisp. Nisp can be retrieved in the same way as the
   simulator. Version 1.0 of the ARS MAGNA simulator is documented in
   Yale Technical Report YALEU/DCS/RR #928, "ARS MAGNA: The Abstract
   Robot Simulator". This report is available in the distribution as a
   PostScript file. Comments should be directed to Sean Philip
   Engelson <engelson@cs.yale.edu>.

   Erratic, a mobile robot simulator and controller by konolige@ai.sri.com is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.ai.sri.com:pub/konolige/erratic-ver1.tar.Z

   The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is a
   tool for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems
   under a variety of conditions.  MICE simulates a two-dimensional
   grid-world in which agents may move, communicate, and affect their
   environment.  MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that
   helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides
   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain
   and its properties, etc.  MICE runs under XWindows on Un*x boxes, on
   Macs, and on TI Explorers, with relatively consistent graphical
   displays.  Source code, documentation, and examples are available via
   anonymous ftp to ftp.eecs.umich.edu:/software/Mice/Mice.tar.Z.  MICE was
   produced by the University of Michigan's Distributed Intelligent Agent
   Group (UM DIAG).  For further information, write to
   umdiagmice@caen.engin.umich.edu.

   RSIM, a SGI-based simulator from the University of Melbourne, with very
   nice graphics, is available by anonymous ftp from
      krang.vis.citri.edu.au:/pub/robot
   Write to cdillon@vis.citri.edu.au for more information.
   
   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
   (the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
   X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
   multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot.  CONNEL is the
   controller, which must be designed by the user (in the distributed
   version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.)  The programs
   use Unix sockets for communication, so you must have sockets, but you
   can run the programs on different machines.  The software is available
   by anonymous ftp from
      galba.mbfys.kun.nl:/pub/neuro-software/pd/ [131.174.82.73]
   as the file simderella.2.0.tar.gz. The software has been compiled using
   gcc on SunOS running under X11R4/5 on Sun3, Sun4, Sun Sparc 1, 2, and
   10, DEC Alpha, HP700, 386/486 (Linux), and Silicon Graphics
   architectures. For more information, send email to Patrick van der
   Smagt, <smagt@fwi.uva.nl>.

Search:

   AISEARCH is a C++ class library for search algorithms implemented by 
   Peter Bouthoorn <peter@icce.rug.nl>. It includes implementations of
   DFS, BFS, uniform cost, best-first, bidirectional DFS/BFS, and AND/OR
   DFS/BFS search algorithms. It is available by anonymous ftp from
   obelix.icce.rug.nl:/pub/peter/ as aisearch.zip or aisearch.tar.Z.

Simulated Annealing:

   ASA (Adaptive Simulated Annealing) is a powerful global optimization
   C-code algorithm especially useful for nonlinear and/or stochastic
   systems. Most current copies can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.alumni.caltech.edu:/pub/ingber/ASA.tar.gz [131.215.48.62]
   an uncompressed version, asa, also is in that archive.  There are several
   related (p)reprints in the Caltech archive, including sa_pvt93.ps.Z,
   "Simulated annealing: Practice versus theory." The first VFSR code was
   developed by Lester Ingber in 1987, and the reprint of that paper is
   vfsr89.ps.Z, "Very fast simulated re-annealing".  If you cannot use
   ftp or ftpmail, then copies of the code are also available by email
   from the author at ingber@alumni.caltech.edu. To be added to the
   mailing list, send mail to asa-request@alumni.caltech.edu.

   The VFSR code was made publicly available in 1992 under the GNU GPL, by
   Lester Ingber and Bruce Rosen.  The last version of that code before
   the introduction of ASA is available via anonymous ftp from
   ringer.cs.utsa.edu:/pub/rosen/vfsr.tar.Z.  Bruce Rosen has a comparison
   study, "Function Optimization based on Advanced Simulated Annealing,"
   which is available via anonymous ftp from
   archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:/pub/neuroprose/rosen.advsim.ps.Z.
   [VFSR is no longer supported, but ASA is. --mk]

Speech:

   RECNET is a complete speech recognition system for the DARPA TIMIT and
   Resource Management tasks.  It uses recurrent networks to estimate phone
   probabilities and Markov models to find the most probable sequence of
   phones or words.  The system is a snapshot of evolving research code.
   There is no documentation other than published research papers.  It is
   configured for the two specific databases and is unlikely to be of use as
   a complete system for other tasks. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/misc/recnet-1.3.tar.Z
   Related publications can be found in 
      svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/reports/ (see the ABSTRACT file first).
   You will need the relevant CDROMs, 150MByte of free space for TIMIT and
   300MByte for RM. If you use the code, the author would appreciate an
   email message so that he can keep you informed of new releases. Write to
   Tony Robinson, <ajr@eng.cam.ac.uk>, for more information.

   CELP 3.2a is available from super.org:/pub/celp_3.2a.tar.Z
   [192.31.192.1] with copies available on
   svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk:/comp.speech/sources/ The code (C, FORTRAN,
   diskio) all has been built and tested on a Sun4 under SunOS4.1.3.  If
   you want to run it somewhere else, then you may have to do a bit of
   work.  (A Solaris 2.x-compatible release is planned soon.) Written by
   Joe Campbell <jpcampb@afterlife.ncsc.mil> of the Department of
   Defense. Distribution facilitated by Craig F. Reese
   <cfreese@super.org>, IDA/Supercomputing Research Center.

   The OGI Speech Tools are set of speech data manipulation tools
   developed at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at
   the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (Portland
   Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and display signal
   representations, label speech at different levels (e.g., phonetic,
   phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers, and display the
   output of classification or recognition algorithms time-aligned with
   the speech. The OGI Speech Tools were written in ANSI C.  The OGI
   Speech Tools are available by anonymous ftp from
      speech.cse.ogi.edu:/pub/tools/ 
   as ogitools.v1.0.tar.Z. For more information, write to Johan Schalkwyk
   <tools@cse.ogi.edu>. If you're using the tools, please let Johan know
   by sending him a mail message.

   PC Convolution is a educational software package that graphically
   demonstrates the convolution operation.  It runs on IBM PC compatibles
   using DOS 4.0 or later. A demo version is available by anonymous ftp

   The LOTEC Speech Recognition Package is all you need to build a
   single-speaker, small-vocabulary, low-quality continuous speech
   recognition module, for use as part of a larger system. It accepts
   input in the form of Sun .au format sound files, along with a set
   of word templates in the same format, and outputs a lattice of word 
   hypotheses. LOTEC is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.sanpo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp:/pub/nigel/lotec/ [130.69.134.32]

Temporal Reasoning:

   See also KNOWBEL above.

   MATS     -- Metric/Allen Time System
               Contact: Henry Kautz <kautz@research.att.com>
               MATS is a Common Lisp program which solves temporal
               constraint problems.  Input constraints are either
               difference inequalities or Allen-style qualitative constraints.

   TimeGraph-- Metric and Qualitative temporal reasoning system which
               handles (<, =, >) point relations, bounds on absolute
               calendar/clock times, and bounds on durations. Data entry
               and retrieval is through interval or point relations.
               The system is scalable in the sense that storage
               remains linear in the number of relations added.
               Efficient retrieval is achieved through a simple 
               timepoint numbering scheme and metagraph structure.
               See SIGART Bulletin 4 (3), pp. 21-25, July 1993.
               Contact: Lenhart Schubert (schubert@cs.rochester.edu)

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point
   Algebra and of the Pointizable Interval Algebra (also called Simple
   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure. TG-II is written in Common Lisp.  For a description of the
   theory underlying the system see:

	  Reasoning through Timegraphs", in Proceedings of IJCAI-93.

   TimeLogic-- The TimeLogic system is an interval-based forward
               chaining inference engine and database manager of
               temporal constraints.  Relational constraints,
               indicating relative order between intervals, are based
               on Allen's interval logic.  The TimeLogic system also
               supports durational constraints, indicating relative
               magnitude between intervals, and reference links, used
               for the explicit or automatic construction of interval
               hierarchies.  Constraints are posed and propagated in
               user-defined contexts with inheritance. Supports relative
               metric constraints but no absolute dates or times.
               Written in Common Lisp.

   TIE      -- Temporal Inference Engine.  Written in Common Lisp.
               Contact: E. Tsang (Essex University, UK)

   TCNM (Temporal Constraint Network Manager) manages non-disjunctive
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations in an integrated
   way. These constraints allow us express absolute, qualitative and
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations, which are managed
   in an integrated way. In the updating processes, a non-redundant and
   global consistent Temporal Constraint Network is always maintained by
   means of an efficient and complete propagation method, with a O(n**2)
   temporal complexity. Sound and complete retrieval processes have a
   constant cost. Written in Common Lisp.  For more information, contact
   Federico A. Barber <fbarber@dsic.upv.es>.  See also SIGART Bulletin
   4(3), July 1993.

   dependent types) and gives it a logic programming interpretation in
   order to support search and the implementation of other algorithms (e.g.
   evaluation or compilation in programming languages).  It comes with a
   number of examples from logic and the theory of programming languages
   such as the Church Rosser theorem for the untyped lambda-calculus and
   type soundness for Mini-ML.  It is written in Standard ML and includes
   some support code for editing and interaction in gnu-emacs. It is
   available by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs/user/fp/public/

   Barker-Plummer <plummer@cs.swarthmore.edu> and Alex Rothenberg
   <alex@cs.swarthmore.edu>. 

   ISABELLE-93. Isabelle is a highly automated generic theorem prover
   written in Standard ML.  New logics are introduced by specifying their
   syntax and rules of inference.  Proof procedures can be expressed
   using tactics and tacticals. Isabelle comes with 8 different logics,
   including LCF, some modal logics, first-order logic, Zermelo-Fraenkel
   set theory, and higher-order logic. Isabelle-93 is not upwardly
   compatible with its predecessor, but comes with advice on converting
   to the new simplifier.  Isabelle-93 is available by anonymous ftp from
   the University of Cambridge,
      ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk:/ml/ [128.232.0.56]
   as Isabelle93.tar.gz. It is also available from the Technical
   University of Munich, 
      ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/lehrstuhl/nipkow/ [131.159.0.198]
   The distribution includes extensive documentation, including a 71-page
   introduction, an 85-page reference manual, and a 166-page description of
   the various logics supplied with Isabelle. For more information, write
   to Larry.Paulson@cl.cam.ac.uk and Tobias.Nipkow@informatik.tu-muenchen.de.
   An Emacs-Lisp package for Isabelle by David.Aspinall@dcs.ed.ac.uk

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.
   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. KEIM also provides
   functionality for the pretty-printing, error handling, formula parsing
   and user interface facilities which form a large part of any theorem
   prover. Implementing with KEIM thus allows the programmer to avoid a
   great deal of drudgery.  KEIM has been tested in Allegro CL 4.1 and
   Lucid CL 4.0 on Sun 4 workstations.  KEIM is available for
   noncommercial use via anonymous FTP from
      js-sfbsun.cs.uni-sb.de:/pub/keim/keim*
   For more information contact Dan Nesmith, Fachbereich Informatik/AG
   Siekmann, Universitaet des Saarlandes, Postfach 1150, D-66041
   Saarbruecken, Germany, or send email to keim@cs.uni-sb.de.  A mailing
   list for KEIM users is also being set up.  Send mail to
   keim-users-request@cs.uni-sb.de to be put on the list.

   theorems formulated by Bevier, Boyer, Brock, Bronstein, Cowles,
   Flatau, Hunt, Kaufmann, Kunen, Moore, Nagayama, Russinoff, Shankar,
   Talcott, Wilding, Yu, and others. The release of Nqthm-1992 includes
   three revised chapters of the book `A Computational Logic Handbook',
   including Chapter 4, on the formal logic for which the system is a
   prover, and Chapter 12, the reference guide to user commands.  Nqthm
   runs in Common Lisp, and has been tested in AKCL, CMU CL, Allegro CL,
   Lucid CL, MCL, and Symbolics CL. Nqthm-1992 is available by anonymous
   ftp from

Theorem Proving/Automated Reasoning (Problems):

   ATP Problems  -- anagram.mcs.anl.gov:/pub/ATP_Problems/*
                    Collection of ATP problems from Otter, CADE, and JAR.
                    The problems include algebra, analysis, circuits,
                    geometry, logic problems, Pelletier's problem set,
                    program verification, puzzles, set theory, and topology.

   The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
   is a collection of test problems for automated theorem provers (ATPs),
   using the clausal normal form of 1st order predicate logic.  The goal
   of the TPTP is to provide a firm basis for the testing, evaluation,
   and comparison of ATP systems through a comprehensive library of ATP
   test problems in a general purpose format. The TPTP includes tools to
   convert the problems to existing ATP formats, such as the OTTER, MGTP,
   PTTP, SETHEO, and SPRFN formats.  Each problem includes a list of
   references and other relevant information.  The TPTP also aims to
   supply general guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system
   evaluation. The TPTP can be obtained by anonymous ftp from either the
   Department of Computer Science, James Cook University, Australia,
      coral.cs.jcu.edu.au:/pub/research/tptp-library/   [137.219.17.4]

   as the files ReadMe (general information about the library),
		TPTP-v1.1.0.tar.gz (the library itself), and
		TR-v1.0.0.ps.gz (a postscript technical report about the TPTP).
   The TPTP is also accessible through WWW using either of the URLs

Subject: [6-2] Technical Reports available by FTP

This section lists the anonymous ftp sites for technical reports from
several universities and other organizations. Some of the sites
provide only an online catalog of technical reports, while the rest
make the actual reports available online. The email address listed is
that of the appropriate person to contact with questions about
ordering technical reports. 

When ftping compressed .Z files, remember to set the transfer type to
binary first, using the command
        ftp> binary

Other general locations for technical reports from several
universities include:
   wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/techreports/ [128.252.135.4]
   cs-archive.uwaterloo.edu:/cs-archive/  (see Index for an index)
      AKA watdragon.uwaterloo.ca [129.97.140.24]
The uwaterloo archive includes tech reports from the Logic Programming
and Artificial Intelligence Group (LPAIG) of the University of Waterloo.

There is also a WAIS server containing tech report abstracts that can be
searched. To use, create the file ~/wais-sources/cs-techreport-abstracts.src 
containing
   (:source
      :version  3
      :ip-address "130.194.74.201"
      :ip-name "daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au"
      :tcp-port 210
      :database-name "cs-techreport-abstracts"
      :cost 0.00
      :cost-unit :free
      :maintainer "wais@daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au")
and invoke your local wais client. To add to it, email abstracts of
your papers to wais@rdt.monash.edu.au in the following format:
   %TI Title
   %AU Author (use multiple %AU lines for multiple authors)
   %PU Published In (citation information)
   %AV Availability (e.g., ftp reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu:/1992/CMU-CS-92-101.ps)
   %OR Organization (see cs-techreport-archives.src for institution codes)
   %LT Local title (e.g., tech report number)
   %DA Date (and, if you want, %MN Month, %YR Year)
   %AB Abstract
If your papers are not available by FTP, you can use a %AV line such as:
   %AV mail harry.bovik@cs.cmu.edu
Further instructions are available from
   daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au:/pub/techreports/reports/README  
[Based on a post by Ashwin Ram.]

Subject: [6-3] Where can I get a machine readable dictionary, thesaurus, and
               other text corpora?

Free:

   /usr/dict/words

   Roget's 1911 Thesaurus is available by anonymous FTP from the
   Consortium for Lexical Research 
      clr.nmsu.edu:/CLR/lexica/roget-1911 [128.123.1.12]
   It is also available from
      src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/literary/collections/project_gutenberg/roget11.txt.Z
   An old Webster's dictionary is in /text/dict/{DICT.Z,DICT.INDEX.Z}.
   Project Gutenberg also has Roget's 1911 Thesaurus. The Project
   Gutenberg archive is at mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu:/pub/etext/. The
   Project Gutenberg archive collects public domain electronic books. For more
   information, write to Michael S. Hart, Professor of Electronic Text,
   Executive Director of Project Gutenberg Etext, Illinois Benedictine
   College, 5700 College Road, Lisle, IL 60532 or send email to
   hart@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu. 

   For people without FTP, Austin Code Works sells floppy disks
   containing Roget's 1911 Thesaurus for $40.00. This money helps support
   the production of other useful texts, such as the 1913 Webster's dictionary.

   The Online Book Initiative maintains a text repository on
   ftp.std.com (a public access UNIX system, 617-739-WRLD). See the
   README file on obi.std.com:/obi/. For more information, send email to
   obi@world.std.com, write to Software Tool & Die, 1330 Beacon Street,
   Brookline, MA 02146, or call 617-739-0202.

   The CHILDES project at Carnegie Mellon University has a lot of data of
   children speaking to adults, as well as the adult written and adult
   spoken corpora from the CORNELL project.  Contact Brian MacWhinney
   <brian@andrew.cmu.edu> for more information.

   A list of 110,000 English words (one per line, in ASCII) is
   available in the PD1:<MSDOS.LINGUISTICS> directory on SIMTEL20 as the
   files WORDS1.ZIP, WORDS2.ZIP, WORDS3.ZIP, and WORDS4.ZIP. Although the
   list is in MS-DOS files, it can easily be used on other machines (but
   first you'll have to unzip the files on a DOS machine). The list
   includes inflected forms of the words, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed, and -ing forms of verbs; thus the number of lexical stems in
   the list is considerably smaller than the total number of word forms.
   These files are available via FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
   [192.88.110.20].  SIMTEL20 files are mirrored on wuarchive.wustl.edu.

Subject: [6-5] AI-related CD-ROMs

Prime Time Freeware for AI:

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is an annual CD-ROM collection of
   Artificial Intelligence freeware source code and documentation. Prime
   Time Freeware for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions on any
   package it includes.  Each issue consists of two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs,
   bound into a 224 page book.

   The current issue (1-1; July 1994) includes a selection of the
   contents of the CMU AI Repository (see [5-1]), including most of the
   AI Programming Languages section and most of the AI Software Packages
   section. Thus the CD-ROMs contain nearly every free implementation of
   Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, and Smalltalk, including graphical user
   interfaces, object-oriented programming extensions, and other software
   development tools.
		      
   They also contain the most complete collection of free software in 
   every area of artificial intelligence research and practice, including 
   Artificial Life, Expert Systems, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms,
   Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning, Natural Language 
   Understanding and Generation, Neural Networks, Planning, Reasoning, 
   Speech Recognition and Synthesis, and Theorem Proving, and much, much more.
				 
   All of the more than 1,300 packages are extensively annotated and
   indexed, with programs for searching the index included on the CDs.
   Since the CD-ROMs use gzip for compression, this means that Prime
   Time Freeware for AI contains more than 5,000 megabytes of
   AI-related software.  

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is targeted at AI researchers, educators,
   students, and practitioners.  Prime Time Freeware for AI is
   particularly useful for programmers who do not have FTP access, but
   may also be useful as a way of saving disk space and avoiding annoying
   FTP searches and retrievals.
				
   Prime Time Freeware helped establish the CMU AI Repository, and sales
   of Prime Time Freeware for AI will continue to help support the
   expansion and maintenance of the repository. The product sells (list)
   for $60 US plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. Thus Prime Time
   Freeware for AI offers more than twice the contents of the NCC AI
   CD-ROM. For more information write to

   The AI CD-ROM is an ISO-9660 format disk usable on any computer system, and
   contains a variety of public domain, shareware, and other software of
   special interest to the AI community. The disk contains source code,
   executable programs, demonstration versions of commercial programs, 
   tutorials and other files for a variety of operating systems. Among the
   supported operating systems are DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and Unix. Among
   the items included are the latest version NASA software such as CLIPS v6,
   NETS, and SPLICER, the collected source code from AIExpert magazine from
   the premier issue in June of 1986 to the present, and complete 
   transcriptions of the first annual Loebner Prize competition. It also
   includes examples many different kinds of neural networks, genetic
   algorithms, artificial life simulators, natural language software,
   public domain and shareware compilers for a wide range of languages
   such as Lisp, Xlisp, Scheme, XScheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, ICON, SNOBOL,
   and many others. Complete collections of the Neural Digest, Genetic
   Algorithms Digest, and Vision List Digest are included. Most files on
   the disk are compressed in ZIP format. Macintosh specific files are 
   in BinHex v4 (.HQX) format. Network Cybernetics Corporation releases annual
   revisions to the AI CD-ROM to keep it up to date with current developments
   in the field. For more information, write to Network Cybernetics

Subject: [6-6] World-Wide Web (WWW) Resources

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia document that spans the
Internet.  It uses the http (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the
light-weight exchange of files over the Internet.  NCSA Mosaic is a
World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). 

Mosaic's popularity derives, in part, from its ability to communicate
using more traditional Internet protocols like FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
NNTP, in addition to http. Mosaic can display text, hypertext links,
and inlined graphics directly. When Mosaic encounters a file type it
can't handle internally, such as Postscript documents, mpeg movies,
sound files, and JPEG images, it uses an external viewer (or player)
like Ghostscript to handle the file. Mosaic also includes facilities
for exploring the Internet. In other words, Mosaic is an multimedia
interface to the Internet.

The hypertext documents viewed with Mosaic are written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).  All that is needed is just a few more
improvements, such as the ability to format tables and mathematics,
and a WYSIWYG editor, for HTML to greatly facilitate electronic
journals and other publications.

NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is available by anonymous ftp from  
   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Mosaic/
as source code and binaries for Sun, SGI, IBM RS/6000, DEC Alpha OSF/1, DEC
Ultrix, and HP-UX. Questions about NCSA Mosaic should be directed to 
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu (X-Windows version), mosaic-mac@ncsa.uiuc.edu
(Macintosh), and mosaic-win@ncsa.uiuc.edu (Microsoft Windows).

If you do not have a WWW client like Mosaic, you can search the WWW by
telnet to info.cern.ch. There is also an email interface; to use it,
send mail to listproc@www-0.cern.ch, and use lines like
   www http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/faqs/top.html
to retrieve the text of a particular URL (in this case, the AI FAQs page).

The remainder of this section lists WWW resources of interest to AI
researchers, students, and practitioners. Other URLs are scattered
throughout the FAQ. If the entry includes an email address, that is
the email address to which suggestions for additional links should be
sent. 

AI-related FAQ Postings:

   A simple HTML version of the AI FAQ (this FAQ) and several other
   AI-related FAQs is available as

Genetic Art and Movies:

   Programs which use genetic algorithms to create art, inspired by the
   work of Karl Sims at Thinking Machines. Votes from human users (folks
   like you) are used to determine the "fitness" of the pictures in the
   current generation. The more fit pictures are more likely to be used
   in the creation of the next generation. After about a dozen or so
   generations, really pretty pictures result.
