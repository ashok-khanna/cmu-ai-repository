Dylan(tm) FAQ
Apple Computer - June 2, 1994

This memo answers questions which are frequently asked about the Dylan
programming language, and its implementations.

The latest version of this memo is available by anonymous ftp from
cambridge.apple.com in the file /pub/dylan/dylan-faq.txt (plain ASCII), or
in the file /pub/dylan/dylan-faq.rtf (formatted, using RTF, which can be
read by Microsoft Word, MacWrite, and many other word processors). Other
Dylan documents are available for ftp from the same directory.

This FAQ was substantially revised on June 2, 1994.

General Questions About Dylan

What is Dylan?

Dylan is a new Object Oriented Dynamic Language (OODL).  Dylan combines the
features of static and dynamic languages.  The goal of the language is to
support a high level of programmer productivity, while still allowing the
efficient delivery of applications and libraries.

Dylan is consistently object-oriented.  It is not a procedural language
with an object-oriented extension.  To this end, Dylan does not attempt to
be compatible with any previously existing programming language.

What is the target audience for Dylan?

The target audience for Dylan is developers of commercial application
software, most of whom are currently using static languages such as C and
C++.   We expect Dylan will appeal to many other groups of programmers as
well, such as educational users who want a very clean object-oriented
language design, or in-house developers who need a high-level, very
productive language.

How does Dylan differ from previous OODLs?

Dylan is designed to allow the powerful and flexible programming techniques
and development environments associated with OODLs, while also allowing the
small, fast delivered applications currently associated with static
languages.

Unlike many dynamic languages, Dylan's design consciously enables the
runtime environment to execute without the development environment present.
In addition, Dylan will let you selectively 'turn-off' dynamic capabilities
when they are no longer needed, allowing more efficient compilation.

Where can I get a copy of the language specification?

The first book on the Dylan language was published in 1992.  Since then,
the language has undergone a great deal of change in response to feedback
from potential users and implementors.  Throughout this process, changes to
the language design have been published electronically in the form of
design notes.  The current round of language design is now essentially
complete except for the macro system.

A new Dylan language reference will be published in early 1995.  This will
be the definitive specification of the Dylan language.  Apple is working
closely with other Dylan implementors to ensure that this book is not
Apple-specific, but rather, applies equally to all Dylan implementations.

Of course, we realize that many people want to read about Dylan now!  So to
fill the gap until the new book is published, we'll make an interim Dylan
reference book available in the first week of June, 1994.  At that time,
you'll be able to get a copy of the interim book by anonymous ftp, in the
file /pub/dylan/interim-book.rtf  The interim book is a combination of the
original Dylan book, the  previously published design notes, and additional
previously unpublished design decisions.  The document is called "interim"
not because the language design is unfinished, but because this is a very
rough document intended for use until the new book is ready.

Are there any public mailing lists for discussing Dylan?

Yes.

The info-dylan mailing list is a forum for discussing all subjects related
to Dylan.  Each day's messages are gathered into a digest and sent as a
single compound message to the list info-dylan-digest.  The mailing list is
also linked to the Newsgroup comp.lang.dylan.

The announce-dylan mailing list is a moderated list, for major
announcements about Dylan (such as the availability of new implementations
of the language).  All messages sent to announce-dylan are also sent to
info-dylan.

To subscribe to info-dylan or announce-dylan, send mail to
majordomo@cambridge.apple.com.  The body of the message should be
"subscribe <list-name>", where <list-name> is the name of the mailing list
you want to subscribe to.  To unsubscribe to one of the mailing lists, send
majordomo a message with the body "unsubscribe <list-name>".  If you would
like to subscribe or unsubscribe an address which is different from the
return address of the message, include the address after the <list-name>.
For complete majordomo instructions, send a message with the body "help".

The name of the digest form of info-dylan is info-dylan-digest.

Please do not send administrative requests to the mailing lists!  If you
have trouble with info-dylan, send mail to sysadmin@cambridge.apple.com.

Where else can I get information about Dylan?

The Gwydion Project at Carnegie Mellon University is maintaining a
WorldWide Web (WWW) page of general information on Dylan.  This is
accessible using Mosaic or other web-browsing software.  This page contains
the original Dylan book in on-line form, annotated with links to the design
notes and changes that have been approved.  This will be replaced by the
interim book shortly after it is released to the public.  This web page
also contains the current FAQ from Apple and other general information of
interest to the Dylan community.

The URL is "http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu:8001/dylan/".

The Gwydion Project also intends to maintain an FTP-accessible on-line
repository of Dylan libraries and code that the authors wish to share with
the rest of the community.  When this is in operation, it will be announced
on the Dylan mailing lists and will be pointed to from the Dylan WWW page
mentioned above.

Where should I send comments on the Dylan language?

Most comments can be sent to info-dylan.  If you wish to send a private
letter to the Apple engineers working on dylan, you can send a message to
dylan-comments@cambridge.apple.com.  (AppleLink users should send mail to
DYLAN).

What should I do if I want to implement Dylan?

Send mail to dylan-comments@cambridge.apple.com.  We have put together a
program to support implementors, and we want to hear from you.  (AppleLink
users should send mail to DYLAN).

If you've written an implementation of Dylan and want to release it, please
contact us for a trademark license.

Does Apple have an implementation of Dylan?

Apple recently announced plans to release an implementation of Dylan.

The following description of Apple's implementation was taken from a data
sheet distributed by Apple.

The Apple Dylan development environment is designed to let you create
complex, commercial-quality projects with all the advantages of a
rapid-prototyping environment.

Your project is stored in a database, unlike traditional, file-based
systems. Apple Dylan's customizable browsers will give you a powerful new
way to look at and manipulate your application as it executes.  You can
browse class hierarchies graphically, find all references to a given
routine or variable, and inspect objects in your program while it's
running.

With Apple Dylan's incremental compiler, you will be able to actually
change code in a running program and see the results right away.  No more
waiting for a long edit, compile, link, execute, debug cycle.  This gives
you freedom as a programmer to explore various options and rapidly improve
your product.

Apple Dylan will include:
o       Dylan compiler and runtime
o       Integrated development environment featuring incremental
development and advanced configurable browsing and viewing of code
o       Dylan application framework
o       Dylan user-interface design and prototyping tool
o       Cross-language support allowing seamless access to existing C and
C++ code and APIs

The first release of Apple Dylan is scheduled to ship in the first quarter
of 1995.  This release will support native 68K stand alone applications.

Six to nine months after the first release, Apple will release a version of
Dylan which supports native PowerPC code and OpenDoc parts (components).

How can I get an early copy of Apple's Dylan implementation?

Send a message to the AppleLink address DYLAN, or the Internet address
dylan@applelink.apple.com.  The message should include your name, address,
phone number, and a brief description of how you plan on using Apple Dylan.

Are there third-party implementations of Dylan available?

Several third-parties have expressed interest in implementing Dylan.
-
One experimental implementation has been released and is being supported.
This implementation is called Marlais, and it was created by Brent Benson.
Marlais 0.3 is available in the Dylan ftp directory at cambridge.apple.com.
-
Harlequin is currently investing in a commercial implementation of Dylan.
They are building a PC based Windows (NT/Chicago) hosted version of the
language.
-
The Gwydion Project at Carnegie Mellon University is building an innovative
new software development and maintenance environment around the Dylan
language.  A part of this work will involve the development of a
high-performance Dylan implementation that will produce code for many
platforms.

For more information on this project, see the Gwydion project's WorldWide Web
page: "http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu:8001/gwydion/".

As a development tool, the Gwydion project has produced a byte-coded Dylan
implementation called "Mindy".  Though it is not very fast, does not have
an extensive environment, and time spent on maintaining it will be limited,
Mindy may be of some value to people who want to play with Dylan code and
get a feel for the language.  It will be released soon for general use. The
release will be announced on the Dylan mailing lists, and the latest
information on Mindy will be available in the Gwydion web page.

Is Dylan related to the Newton PDA?

Not at this time. If you are looking for more information on Newton
development, you need to contact the Newton Developer Relations at
NEWTON.DEVS@applelink.apple.com.

Is Dylan designed to be a replacement for Common Lisp?

No.  We see Common Lisp and Dylan filling two distinct needs.

Is Dylan a proprietary language?  Why is the Dylan name trademarked?

We want Dylan to be available on as many computers as possible.  To this
end, we are encouraging groups outside Apple to implement Dylan.

It is our intention to license the Dylan trademark to any implementation
which passes a standard test suite.  The purpose of the trademark is to
ensure quality and consistency among implementations.

Is the Dylan language design frozen?

With the exception of the macro system, the current language design is
complete.  At this time, we will only be making small tweaks, or changes
necessary to resolve bugs or inconsistencies in the specification.

Is there a group which promotes the use of object-oriented dynamic languages?

Yes.  There is an OODL special interest group of the Software Frameworks
Association (formerly called MADA).  SFA is a group which champions
object-oriented programming on the Macintosh as well as other platforms.

To subscribe to the OODL sig mailing list from AppleLink send mail to
OODL.SIG. Internet subscriptions should be requested from
oodl-sig-request@cambridge.apple.com.


Questions about the Dylan Language Design


What does the Dylan syntax look like?

The first Dylan book used a parenthesized, lisp-like syntax.  The current
version uses an Algol-like syntax, which will be very familiar to users of
Pascal or C.

Will Dylan have a standard macro system with the algebraic syntax?
Yes.

Are there plans to specify a standard I/O package for Dylan?  What about
threads?

Threads, I/O, and other language features may be provided as optional
libraries in the future.  They are not currently part of the language.

Because of the great variety of computing platforms-from PDA to
mainframe-we do not want to standardize on these features too strictly.

Why is make allowed to return a previously allocated instance, or an object
which is an indirect instance of the class passed to make?

We feel that this is a very important abstraction mechanism.  A class
should have flexibility in how it implements make, as long as the object
returned fulfills the protocol of the class.

For example, this allows a library to document a single abstract class
which is supported by several undocumented implementation classes. The
abstract class can choose which implementation class to instantiate based
on the additional arguments to make.  This allows optimizations which are
transparent to the clients of the library.

The default method for make of a user-defined class returns a fresh direct
instance of the requested class.

The Dylan manual doesn't require implementations to optimize tail-recursion
Was this an intentional omission, or an editorial oversight?

It was an editorial oversight.  Dylan implementations will be required to
be properly tail recursive.

The Dylan manual doesn't say much about modules.  Will this be specified in
the future?

The new language document includes a complete module specification.

Can the 'method' special form be used to create closures?

Yes.

I don't understand how setter variables work.  Is setter a special form?

This has been clarified in the new language design.  The new design is
included in the interim Dylan reference book.

What kind of object is used to return multiple values?

When a function returns multiple values, the return values are not stored
in a wrapper object;  they are returned directly.  For example, if a
function returns "the values 4 and 5", it returns two integers.  It does
not return a data structure which contains two integers.

Returning multiple values is similar to calling a function with more than
one argument.  When passing multiple objects as arguments to a function,
the objects do not have to be stored in a single data structure before they
are passed.

Is the specification of sealing complete?

Yes.  The new language design includes a complete specification of sealing.
This design will be included in the interim Dylan reference book.

Will Dylan include eval?

Some implementations may choose to support eval, but we do not have plans
to add it to the language standard.  We feel that the delivery of
applications which are space efficient requires the separation of
development time activity from runtime activity.

Will Dylan include an application framework?

We recognize the value of application frameworks, especially cross-platform
application frameworks.  Unfortunately, because of the great variation in
computing platforms, a single application framework will not be part of the
Dylan language.  On each platform, there should either be a Dylan-specific
application framework, or Dylan should be able to use application
frameworks written in other languages.

Will Dylan interface to other languages?

We recognize that seamless integration with other languages, especially C
and C++, is essential.  We are working on addressing this issue.  The
solutions may not be part of the Dylan language proper.
