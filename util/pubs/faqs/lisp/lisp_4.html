Subject: [4-0]   Free Common Lisp implementations.

Repositories of Lisp source code are described in the answer to
question [6-1]. 

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

   The Allegro CL 3.0 Web Version for Windows is a full functional free
   version of our Dynamic Object Oriented Programming Development System
   for ANSI standard CLOS, with some limitations*.  This version includes
   an in-core native 32-bit compiler, a drag & drop Interface Builder,
   full debugging and development tools and an editor.  We sell a supported
   version of this software, Allegro CL for Windows, without these
   limitations.  For more information, call 1-800-3-CLOS-NOW or
   1-510-548-3600, fax 1-510-548-8253, or send email to info@franz.com.
   Franz's web page is located at the URL
      http://www.franz.com/
   Suggestions and bug reports should be sent to web@franz.com. Since
   this software is unsupported, they may not get back to you, but the
   input is still welcome.
   * The limitations are: limited heap size, no foreign function support,
   missing compile-file, missing disassembler and missing save-image.
   The documentation fully explains these capabilities.

   CLiCC (Common Lisp to C Compiler) generates C-executables from Common
   Lisp application programs. CLiCC is not a Common Lisp system, and
   hence does not include any program development or debugging support.
   CLiCC is intended to be used as an add-on to existing Common Lisp
   systems for generating portable applications. (CLiCC has been tested
   in Allegro CL, Lucid CL, CMU CL, CLISP, and AKCL. It should run in any
   CLtL1 lisp with CLOS.)  CLiCC supports CL_0, a subset of Common Lisp +
   CLOS, which excludes EVAL and related functions. At present CL_0 is
   based on CLtL1, but is headed towards CLtL2 and ANSI-CL. The generated
   C code (ANSI-C or K&R-C compatible) may be compiled using a
   conventional C compiler on the target machine, and must be linked with
   the CLiCC runtime library in order to generate executables. CLiCC has
   a foreign function interface.  CLiCC is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.informatik.uni-kiel.de:/pub/kiel/apply/clicc-0.6.4.tar.gz
      [134.245.15.114].   
   CLiCC was developed by Wolfgang Goerigk <wg@informatik.uni-kiel.de>,
   Ulrich Hoffman <uho@informatik.uni-kiel.de>, and Heinz Knutzen
   <hk@informatik.uni-kiel.de> of Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet zu
   Kiel, Institut fuer Informatik und Praktische Mathematik,
   Preusserstr.  1-9, D-24105 Kiel, Germany. The authors welcome
   suggestions and improvements and would appreciate receiving email
   even if you just used CLiCC successfully. For more information,
   send mail to clicc@informatik.uni-kiel.de. 

   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) implementation by
   Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich
   University, both in Germany.  It runs on microcomputers (DOS, OS/2,
   Atari ST, Amiga 500-4000) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, Sun4,
   Sun386, HP9000/800, SGI, Sun3 and others) and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM.
   It is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL.
   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler, a subset of CLOS (e.g., no MOP)
   and, for some machines, a screen editor. Packages running in CLISP 
   include PCL and, on Unix machines, CLX and Garnet.  Available by anonymous 
   ftp from
      ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de:/pub/lisp/clisp/ [129.13.115.2]
   For more information, contact haible@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de.
   There is a mailing list for users of CLISP. It is the proper forum for
   questions about CLISP, installation problems, bug reports, application
   packages etc. For information about the list and how to subscribe,
   send mail to listserv@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de, with the two lines
          help
          information clisp-list
   in the message body.
   A Sybase SQL interface interface for CLIPS is available
   by anonymous ftp from wuarchive.wustl.edu:packages/clips2sybase/. For
   more information, write to Sherry Steib <sherry@informatics.wustl.edu>.

   CMU Common Lisp (CMU CL) is free, and runs on HPs, Sparcs (Mach,
   SunOs, and Solaris), DecStation 3100 (Mach), SGI MIPS (Iris), DEC
   Alpha/OSF1, IBM RT (Mach) and requires 16mb RAM, 25mb disk. It
   includes an incremental compiler, Hemlock emacs-style editor,
   source-code level debugger, code profiler and is mostly X3J13
   compatible, including the new loop macro.  It is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/clisp/release [128.2.206.173]
   Login with username "anonymous" and "userid@host" (your email
   address) as password. Due to security restrictions on anonymous ftps
   (some of the superior directories on the path are protected against
   outside access), it is important to "cd" to the source directory with
   a single command.  Don't forget to put the ftp into binary mode before
   using "get" to obtain the compressed/tarred files. The binary releases
   are contained in files of the form
                <version>-<machine>_<os>.tar.Z
   Other files in this directory of possible interest are
   17f-source.tar.gz, which contains all the ".lisp" source files
   used to build version 17f. A listing of the current contents of the
   release area is in the file FILES. You may also use "dir" or "ls" to 
   see what is available. Bug reports should be sent to cmucl-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.

   ECoLisp is a Common Lisp implementation which compiles Lisp functions
   into C functions that use the C stack and standard procedure call
   conventions. This lets Lisp and C code be easily mixed. It can be used
   as a C library from any C application.  It is available by anonymous
   ftp from 
      ftp.di.unipi.it:/pub/lang/lisp/     [131.114.4.36]
      ftp.icsi.berkeley.edu:/pub/ai/ecl/  [128.32.201.7]
   as the file ecl-??.tar.gz where ?? is the version number. This is an alpha
   release. So far it has been tested on Sun workstations (SunOS 4.x),
   SGI (IRIX 4.x), and IBM PC (DOS/go32). For more information, please contact
   Giuseppe Attardi <attardi@di.unipi.it> or <attardi@icsi.berkeley.edu>.

   GNU Common Lisp (GCL) is a free implementation of Common Lisp (CLtL1)
   based originally on Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL). Versions 1.0
   and above of GCL (aka versions 1-625 and above of AKCL) are
   available under the GNU General Public Library License v2.0, and no
   longer require the kcl.tar file to build the system. For
   information on previous versions of AKCL, see the KCL entry. GCL
   generates C code which it compiles with the local optimizing C
   compiler (e.g., GCC).  It is intended to eventually support the
   ANSI standard for Common Lisp. GCL runs on Sparc, IBM RT, RS/6000,
   DecStation 3100, hp300, hp800, Macintosh (under A/UX), mp386, 
   IBM PS2, IBM RT_AIX, Silicon Graphics 4d, Sun3, Sun4, Sequent
   Symmetry, IBM 370, NeXT, Vax, and IBM PC 386/486 (linux, bsd).
   GCL version 1.0 and above are available by anonymous ftp from  
      ftp.cli.com:/pub/gcl/		[192.31.85.129]
      math.utexas.edu:/pub/gcl/		[128.83.133.215]
   as the file gcl-X.X.tgz (e.g., gcl-2.1.tgz), where X.X should be 
   replaced with the version number; you'll generally want the largest
   version number. The bandwidth to math.utexas.edu is higher than cli. 
   The file pcl-gcl-1.0.tgz contains a port of PCL (CLOS) to GCL.
   The file xgcl-2.tgz contains an interface to X Windows for GCL,
   including a low-level interface to Xlib, and in addition to being
   available from the above sites, is also available from
      ftp.cs.utexas.edu:/pub/novak/xgcl/
      http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/
   For more information, write to William Schelter <wfs@math.utexas.edu> 
   (or <wfs@cli.com>, <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>). GCL is under
   continuing development, and folks interested in helping should send
   him email. Andy Wang <awang@plains.nodak.edu> has compiled GCL 1.0
   for Linux 1.1.50 (using gcc 2.5.8 and libc 4.5.26) and made the
   resulting binaries available by anonymous ftp from
      sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming/gcl-1.0.bin.tgz

   Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is free, but requires a license. Conforms to CLtL1.
   KCL was written by T. Yuasa <yuasa@tutics.tut.ac.jp> and M. Hagiya
   <hagiya@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp> at Kyoto University in 1984. Austin
   Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) is a collection of ports, bug fixes and
   improvements to KCL by Bill Schelter (<wfs@cli.com> or
   <wfs@rascal.ics.utexas.edu>). Since 1994, AKCL versions 1-625 and
   higher are covered by the GNU GPL, so generally one will generally
   not need KCL (see GCL above for details). {A}KCL generates C code
   which it compiles with the local C compiler. Both are available by
   anonymous ftp from   
      rascal.ics.utexas.edu:/pub/ [128.83.138.20]
      ftp.cli.com:/pub/ [192.31.85.1]
      utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.JP:/pub/ [133.11.11.11]
   KCL is in the file kcl.tar, and AKCL is in the file akcl-xxx.tar.Z
   (take the highest value of xxx).  To obtain KCL, one must first sign
   and mail a copy of the license agreement to: Special Interest Group in
   LISP, c/o Taiichi Yuasa, Department of Computer Science, Toyohashi
   University of Technology, Toyohashi 441, JAPAN. Runs on Sparc, IBM RT,
   RS/6000, DecStation 3100, hp300, hp800, Macintosh (under A/UX),
   mp386, IBM PS2, Silicon Graphics 4d, Sun3, Sun4, Sequent Symmetry, IBM
   370, NeXT and Vax. For the beta test version of the DOS port, see
   the files akclexe.zip and go32sexe.zip in
      math.utexas.edu:/pub/msdos/akcl-beta/
   Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
   11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax
   512-258-1342, E-mail guthery@acw.com, including a CLOS for AKCL.

   PowerLisp is a Common Lisp development environment for the Macintosh.
   It consists of a Common Lisp interpreter, native-code 680x0 compiler,
   680x0 macro assembler, disassembler, incremental linker and
   multi-window text editor. It requires a Macintosh with at least a
   68020 processor (any Mac except a Plus, SE or Classic) and system 7.0
   or later. About 2 megabytes of RAM are required to run it, and to do
   much with it you need more like 5 or 6 megabytes. Like any Common Lisp
   system, the more memory the better.  PowerLisp has the ability to run
   in the background. While executing a Common Lisp program, the user may
   switch to another application as it continues to run. You can also
   edit programs while a Common Lisp program is running. PowerLisp is
   targeted to be compatible with CTLTL2 without CLOS (for now) but some
   Common Lisp functions are not yet implemented. Upcoming versions
   should include the remaining language features. The current released
   version is 1.10. PowerLisp is available from America Online and Genie as a
   shareware program ($50). It is also available from the Lisp
   Repository, as
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/powerlsp/v1_10/powerlsp.hqx
   Written by Roger Corman. For more information, send mail to
   PowerLisp@aol.com, roger@island.com or rogerc34@aol.com (RogerC34
   on America Online). 


   RefLisp is a small Lisp interpreter. Versions exist for MS Windows,
   MS-DOS and UNIX (AIX). The MS-DOS version supports CGA/EGA/VGA
   graphics and the Microsoft Mouse. The interpreter is a shallow-binding
   (i.e., everything has dynamic scope), reference counting design making
   it suitable for experimenting with real-time and graphic user
   interface programming. Common Lisp compatibility macros are provided,
   and most of the examples in "Lisp" by Winston & Horn have been run on
   RefLisp. RefLisp makes no distinction between symbol-values and
   function-values, so a symbol can be either but not both.  RefLisp
   comes with an ASCII manual and many demonstration programs, including
   an analogue clock which never stops for garbage collection.  It is
   written in ANSI C and is in the public domain. Source and binaries are
   available from the author's Web site at
       http://www.ozemail.com.au/~birchb/reflisp.html
   and from the Lisp Utilities repository by anonymous ftp from 
       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/reflisp/
   For further information, send email to the author Bill Birch
   <birchb@ozemail.com.au>. 

   WCL is an implementation of Common Lisp for Sparc based workstations.
   It is available free by anonymous ftp from 
      cdr.stanford.edu:/pub/wcl/  [36.93.0.31]
   as the files wcl2.2-solaris-src.tar.gz, wcl2.2-solaris-bins.tar.gz,
   wcl2.2-sunos4-src.tar.gz, wcl2.2-sunos4-bins.tar.gz, and
   wgdb4.2-sunos4.tar.gz. It includes a native solaris version (but with
   no dynamic .o loading or wgdb yet...), can use any version of GCC 2.X
   (GCC 2.1 is no longer required), and includes separate binary and
   source distribution so that recompilation is no longer needed to
   install WCL and WGDB. The wcl2.2-*.tar.gz files contain the WCL
   distribution, including CLX and PCL; wgdb4.2-sunos4.tar.gz contains a
   version of the GDB debugger which has been modified to grok WCL's
   Lisp.  WCL provides a large subset of Common Lisp as a Unix shared
   library that can be linked with Lisp and C code to produce efficient
   and small applications. For example, the executable for a Lisp version
   of the canonical ``Hello World!''  program requires only 40k bytes
   under SunOS 4.1 for SPARC. WCL provides CLX R5 as a shared library,
   and comes with PCL and a few other utilities.  For further information
   on WCL, see the paper published in the proceedings of the 1992 Lisp
   and Functional Programming Conference, a copy of which appears in the
   wcl directory as lfp-paper.ps, or look in the documentation directory
   of the WCL distribution. Written by Wade Hennessey
   <wade@sunrise.stanford.edu>.  Please direct any questions to
   wcl@sunrise.stanford.edu. If you would like to be added to a mailing
   list for information about new releases, send email to
   wcl-request@sunrise.stanford.edu.

   XLISP is free, and runs on the IBM PC (MSDOS), Windows 95, Apple
   Macintosh, and Unix. It should run on anything with an Ansi C
   compiler.  It was written by David Michael Betz, 18 Garrison Drive,
   Bedford, NH 03110, 603-472-2389 (H&W), DavidBetz@aol.com or
   dbetz@xlisper.mv.com. The reference manual was written by
   Tim Mikkelsen. Version 2.0 is available by anonymous ftp from
      cs.orst.edu:/pub/xlisp/ [128.193.32.1] or
      sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/lang/
   Version 2.1g* is the same as XLISP 2.0, but modified by Tom Almy 
   <toma@sail.labs.tek.com> to bring it closer to Common Lisp, in
   addition to fixing several bugs. The latest version of XLISP can be
   obtained by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/xlisp/ [128.2.206.173]
   It may also be available (in possible older versions) from
      ftp.biostr.washington.edu:/pub/xlisp      [128.95.10.115]
      wasp.eng.ufl.edu:/pub                     [128.227.116.1]
   A Macintosh port of version 2.1e (and the C source code to its
   interface) is also available, from Macintosh ftp sites such as
      sumex.stanford.edu:/info-mac/dev/xlisp-21e2.hqx
      mac.archive.umich.edu:/mac/development/languages/xlisp2.1e2.sit.hqx
   The Macintosh version was written by Brian Kendig, <bskendig@netcom.com>.
   To obtain a copy through US mail, send email to Tom Almy,
   toma@sail.labs.tek.com. A Windows version of the statistical
   version of xlisp is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cica.indiana.edu:/util/wxlslib.zip
   A version of XLISP-PLUS 2.1g that includes an experimental byte code 
   compiler is available by anonymous ftp from
      umnstat.stat.umn.edu:/pub/xlispstat/xlisponly/ [128.101.51.1]

    into C-related products; the Lisp end of the company remained strong.
    Harlequin announced on 23-NOV-94 that they have acquired the
    rights to the Lisp-related technology of Lucid, Inc., that they
    will market and support Lucid Common Lisp alongside their
    LispWorks products, and that they have hired several former Lucid
    employees for this purpose.]

Macintosh Common Lisp:

   Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) is an object-oriented dynamic language
   (OODL) from Digitool, Inc. MCL 4.0 will work on any Power Macintosh
   with at least 16 MB of RAM, 28 MB of disk storage, and Macintosh System
   Software 7.5 or later. MCL 3.1 will work on any 68K-based Macintosh
   with at least 8 MB of RAM, 15 MB of disk storage, and Macintosh System
   6.x or 7.x. Both versions are included on CD-ROM together with extensive
   documentation, runtime sources, development utilities, and sample code. 
   A CD-ROM drive is required for installation.
   
   MCL implements the industry standard Common Lisp programming language 
   and CLOS (as defined in Common Lisp: The Language, second edition), 
   and is fully integrated with the Macintosh family of personal computers.

   MCL is a completely integrated development environment, including a
   fast incremental compiler which produces efficient native PPC code or
   680x0 code, a window-based debugger, a source code stepper, a dynamic 
   object inspector, a stack backtrace inspector, a programmable 
   Macintosh-style emacs-like editor, online documentation, and an 
   interactive interface toolkit. MCL supports multiple processes and 
   provides both high-level object-oriented user interface class library 
   and complete low-level access to the Macintosh Toolbox.  

   Using MCL, you can create a standalone double-clickable Macintosh 
   application. A license is required to distribute an application
   created with MCL. Licenses are available to include the MCL compiler
   in a distributed application.

   MCL may be purchased individually or as a subscription; site licenses
   are also available. For more information, mailto:info@digitool.com;

Lisp-to-C Translator translates Common Lisp into human-readable ANSI
C.  Release 3.2 supports such features as CLOS, the condition system,
Lisp type declaration heeding, and Mac, Windows, and Alpha
compatibility.  (Release 3.0, introduced in 1992, eliminated the old
requirement that the garbage collector had to be called explicitly).
Works with Lucid, Symbolics, Allegro, Harlequin and MCL.  It costs
$11,995.  Write to: Chestnut Software, Inc., 2 Park Plaza, Suite 205,

Subject: [4-2] Scheme Implementations

Scheme implementations are listed in the Scheme FAQ posting,

Free Scheme implementations include PC-Scheme, PCS/Geneva, MIT Scheme (aka
C-Scheme), SCM, Hobbit, Gambit, T, Oaklisp, Elk, Scheme->C, SIOD
(Scheme in One Defun), XScheme, Fools' Lisp, Scheme48, UMB Scheme,
VSCM, Pixie Scheme, HELP (a lazy Scheme), Similix, FDU Scheme,
PseudoScheme, Scheme84 and Scheme88.

Commercial Scheme implementations include Chez Scheme, MacScheme, and EdScheme.

Of the free Scheme implementations, the following are implemented in Lisp:  

   Peter Norvig's book "Paradigms of AI Programming" has a chapters about
   Scheme interpreters and compilers, both written in Common Lisp. The
   software from the book is available by anonymous ftp from
   mkp.com:/Norvig/ and on disk in Macintosh or DOS format from
   the publisher, Morgan Kaufmann.  For more information, contact: Morgan
   Kaufmann, Dept. P1, 2929 Campus Drive, Suite 260, San Mateo CA 94403,
   or call Toll free tel: (800) 745-7323; FAX: (415) 578-0672

   PseudoScheme is available free by anonymous ftp from
      swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu:/archive/pseudo/pseudo-2-8.tar.Z [18.43.0.152]
   It is Scheme implemented on top of Common Lisp, and runs in Lucid,
   Symbolics CL, VAX Lisp under VMS, and Explorer CL. It should be easy
   to port to other Lisps. It was written by Jonathan Rees
   (jar@altdorf.ai.mit.edu, jar@cs.cornell.edu). Send mail to
   info-clscheme-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu to be put on a mailing list for
   announcements. Conforms to R3RS except for lacking a correct
   implementation of call/cc. It works by running the Scheme code through
   a preprocessor, which generates Common Lisp code.

   Scheme84 is in the public domain, and available by mail from Indiana
   University. It runs on the VAX in Franz Lisp under either VMS or BSD Unix.
   To receive a copy, send a tape and return postage to: Scheme84
   Distribution, Nancy Garrett, c/o Dan Friedman, Department of Computer
   Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. Call 1-812-335-9770
   or send mail to nlg@indiana.edu for more information. It will also
   run in Jeff Dalton's port of Franz Lisp to Net/Free/386BSD on 386-like
   machines.  (See the Lisp FAQ for information on Franz Lisp.)

   Scheme88 is a re-implementation of Scheme84 to run in Common Lisp. It
   available by anonymous ftp from
      rice.edu:/public/scheme88.sh
   and also from the Scheme Repository.

Subject: [4-4]   Free Implementations of Other Lisp Dialects

Franz Lisp:

   [Franz Lisp is a dialect of Lisp that predates Common Lisp. It is
   very similar to MacLisp. It lacks full lexical scoping.]

   The official archive site for Franz List Opus 38.92 and 38.93b (the
   last public domain releases) is
       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/others/franzlsp/
   It includes the official version from the ucbvax ftp site before
   its demise, Barry Schein's port of 38.92, the UC Davis port of 38.92,
   and Jeff Dalton's port of 38.92 (see below). For more information, 
   contact ai+franzlsp@cs.cmu.edu.

   An implementation of (Berkeley) Franz Lisp Opus 38.92 for 386/486
   machines running NetBSD 0.9 (and possibly also 386BSD and FreeBSD)
   is available by anonymous ftp from 
      macbeth.cogsci.ed.ac.uk:/pub/franz-for-NetBSD/
   The implementation generates C code and hence is quite portable. It
   has been tested on 68K Suns, VAX 750s, and ICL Perqs running PNX.
   A reference manual is included in the distribution. For more
   information, write to Jeff Dalton <J.Dalton@ed.ac.uk>, or see the URL
      http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~jeff/franz-for-386.html

   PC LISP is a Lisp interpreter for IBM PCs (MSDOS) available from any
   site that archives the group comp.binaries.ibm.pc, such as
      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/msdos/lisp/pclisp30.zip 
   PC-LISP is a Franz LISP dialect and is by no means Common LISP
   compatible. It is also available directly from the author by sending
   2 blank UNFORMATTED 360K 48TPI IBM PC diskettes, a mailer and
   postage to: Peter Ashwood-Smith, 8 Du Muguet, Hull, Quebec, CANADA,
   J9A-2L8; phone 819-595-9032 (home). Source code is available from the
   author for $15.

EuLisp:

   Feel (Free and Eventually Eulisp) is an initial implementation of the
   EuLisp language. It can be retrieved by anonymous FTP from
      ftp.bath.ac.uk:/pub/eulisp/ 
   as the file feel-0.75.tar.Z. feel-0.75.sun4.Z is the Sparc executable.
   The EuLisp language definition is in the same directory.  Feel is also
   available from
      ftp.gmd.de:/languages/lisp/eulisp/ [129.26.8.84] 
   It includes an integrated object system, a module system, condition
   system, and support for parallelism (threads). EuLisp (European
   Lisp) is sort of like an extended Scheme.  The program is a C-based
   interpreter, and a bytecode interpreter/compiler will be available
   sometime soon.  The distribution includes an interface to the PVM
   library, support for TCP/IP sockets, and libraries for futures, Linda,
   and CSP.  Feel is known to run on Sun3, Sun4, Stardent Titan, Alliant
   Concentrix 2800, Orion clippers, DEC VAX, DECstation 3000, Gould
   UTX/32, and Inmos T800 transputer (using CS-Tools). (All bar the last
   four have a threads mechanism.) It can run in multi-process mode on
   the first three machines, and hopefully any other SysV-like machine
   with shared memory primitives. Porting Feel to new machines is
   reasonably straightforward. It now also runs on MS-DOS machines.
   Written by Pete Broadbery <pab@maths.bath.ac.uk>.

   Apply/Eu2C is an EuLisp->C compiler available from ISST.  Eu2C runs on
   top of Franz Allegro CL 4.1 and compiles EuLisp-Modules into C source
   code which then must be compiled by an ANSI C-compiler (currently only
   GCC is supported).  The Eu2C implementation provides EuLisp 0.99
   level-0, with the exception of concurrency. Future versions of Eu2C
   will include a C interface and straight module compilation.  The
   development of Apply/Eu2C was supported by the German Federal Ministry
   for Research and Technology (BMFT) within the joint project APPLY. The
   partners of this project are the Christian Albrechts University Kiel,
   the Fraunhofer Institute for Software Engineering and Systems
   Engineering (ISST), the German National Research Center for Computer
   Science(GMD), and VW-Gedas.  The main goal of APPLY project is to
   develop a Lisp system which consistently supports the efficient
   execution of applications and simplifies their integration into
   current software environments.  Towards that end, ISST is
   investigating strategies for the compilation of EuLisp-Modules into
   efficient stand-alone C-Programs. The Eu2C compiler is the first step
   along this path. Eu2C is available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.isst.fhg.de:/APPLY/Distribution/.  Please send bug reports and
   comments to ulrich.kriegel@isst.fhg.de or ingo.mohr@isst.fhg.de. If
   you're using Eu2C, please send them a message with "Apply/Eu2C" in the
   subject line to be added to the mailing list of users.

   More information about EuLisp may be found in 
      Lisp and Symbolic Computation 6(1-2), August 1993
   which was devoted to EuLisp.

   Le-Lisp includes a compiler, color and graphic output, a debugger, a
   pretty printer, performance analysis tools, tracing, and incremental
   execution. Le-Lisp currently runs on Unix, VMS, and Windows 3.1.  Note
   that Le-Lisp is neither Common Lisp nor Scheme.  Le-Lisp was
   originally developed in 1980 at Inria, the French national computer
   science laboratory, by a team led by Jerome Chailloux for work on VLSI
   design. It was based on several earlier Lisps in the MacLisp family,
   but was not directly derived from MacLisp.  Le-Lisp enjoyed a large
   success in the French academic world because it was small, fast, and
   portable, being based on a abstract machine language called LLM3.  In
   1983, for example, Le-Lisp ran on Z-80 machines running CP/M. In 1987,
   Ilog was formed as an offshoot of Inria to commercialize and improve
   Le-Lisp and several products which had been developed with it,
   including a portable graphic interface system and an expert system
   shell.  Since then, Ilog has continued to grow and expand the use of
   Le-Lisp into industrial markets around the world.  Ilog is the largest
   European Lisp vendor, and continues to develop new products and
   markets for Lisp.  In 1992, Ilog released the next major version of
   Le-Lisp, Le-Lisp version 16.  This version modernizes Le-Lisp for use
   in the industrial world, adding lexical closures and
   special-form-based semantics for static analysis, a new object system
   based on the EuLisp object system (TELOS), an enhanced module system
   for application production, a conservative GC for integration with C
   and C++, and compilation to C for portability and efficiency on a wide
   range of processors.  For pricing and other information, write to

   Lily (LIsp LibrarY) is a C++ class library that lets C++ programmers
   write LISP-style code. Includes some example programs from Winston's
   Lisp book recoded in Lily. Most or all of chapters 17 (Symbolic
   Pattern Matching), 18 (Expert Problem Solving), and 23 (Lisp in Lisp)
   are implemented in the examples. Lily works with GNU G++ (2.4.5) and
   Turbo C++ for Windows. Lily is available by anonymous ftp from
     sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/packages/development/libraries/ [152.2.22.81]
   as lily-0.1.tar.gz. This site is fairly slow; a copy is available from
   the Lisp Utilities collection. For more information, contact 
   Roger Sheldon <sheldon@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov>.


Other Lisps for PCs include: 

   o  UO-LISP from Calcode Systems, e-mail:calcode!marti@rand.org
      It comes complete with compiler and interpreter, and is optimised for
      large programs.  It is Standard LISP, not Common LISP. They are based
      in Amoroso Place in Venice, CA. 

   o  LISP/88 v1.0. Gotten from Norell Data Systems, 3400 Wilshire Blvd,
      Los Angeles, CA 90010, in 1983. They may or may not still exist. 

   o  IQLisp. Not a Common Lisp but still very good for PCs - you can
      actually get a lot done in 640K.  The lisp itself runs in less than
      128K and every cons cell takes only 6 bytes.  Unfortunately that
      makes the 640K (maybe a little more, but certainly no more than 1M)
      limit really hard. It has a byte code compiler which costs extra. 
      This has support for all sorts of PC specific things.
      It costs $175 w/o compiler, $275 with.

Subject: [4-6] What is Dylan?

Dylan is a new Object-Oriented Dynamic Language (OODL), based on
Scheme, CLOS, and Smalltalk.  The purpose of the language is to retain
the benefits of OODLs and also allow efficient application delivery.
The design stressed keeping Dylan small and consistent, while allowing
a high degree of expressiveness. Dylan is consistently object-oriented;
it is not a procedural language with an object-oriented extension. A
manual/specification for the language is available from Apple Computer.
Send email to dylan-manual-request@cambridge.apple.com or write to
Apple Computer, 1 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142.  Include your
complete address and also a phone number (the phone number is
especially important for anyone outside the US). Comments on Dylan can
be sent to the internet mail address dylan-comments@cambridge.apple.com.

The mailing list info-dylan@cambridge.apple.com is for any and all
discussions of Dylan, including language design issues, implementation
issues, marketing issues, syntax issues, etc. The mailing list
announce-dylan@cambridge.apple.com is for major announcements about
Dylan, such as the availability of new implementations, new versions
of the manual, etc.  This mailing list should be *much* lower volume
than info-dylan.  Everything sent to this list is also sent to
info-dylan.  The newsgroup comp.lang.dylan is gatewayed to the
info-dylan mailing list.  

Send mail to the -request version of the list to be added to it.
You can also send an email message to majordomo@cambridge.apple.com
with "subscribe info-dylan" or "unsubscribe info-dylan" in the body,
and likewise for the other lists, mutatis mutandis.

Apple hasn't announced plans to release Dylan as a product.  

The directory cambridge.apple.com:pub/dylan contains some documents
pertaining to Dylan, including a FAQ list.

======== THOMAS ========

Thomas is a compiler for a language that is compatible with the
language described in the book "Dylan(TM) an object-oriented dynamic
language" by Apple Computer Eastern Research and Technology, April
1992. Thomas was written at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge
Research Laboratory. Thomas is NOT Dylan(TM) and was built with no
direct input, aid, assistance or discussion with Apple.

Thomas is available to the public by anonymous ftp at
       crl.dec.com:/pub/DEC/Thomas
       gatekeeper.pa.dec.com:/pub/DEC/Thomas
       swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu:/archive/Thomas

The Thomas system is written in Scheme and runs under MIT's CScheme,
DEC's Scheme->C, and Marc Feeley's Gambit.  It can run on a wide range
of machines including the Macintosh, PC compatibles, Vax, MIPS, Alpha,
and 680x0.  Thomas generates IEEE compatible Scheme code.

A ready-made version of Thomas 1.1 interpreter built upon MacGambit
2.0 as a double-clickable Macintosh application is available by
anonymous ftp from cambridge.apple.com:/pub/dylan/gambit/ as
the file thomas-1.1-interp.hqx.

For discussion of Thomas, send a note to
   info-thomas-request@crl.dec.com 
to be added to the mailing list. 

DEC CRL's goals in building Thomas were to learn about Dylan by
building an implementation, and to build a system they could use to
write small Dylan programs. As such, Thomas has no optimizations of
any kind and does not perform well. 

The original development team consisted of:
          Matt Birkholz (Birkholz@crl.dec.com)
          Jim Miller (JMiller@crl.dec.com)
          Ron Weiss (RWeiss@crl.dec.com)
In addition, Joel Bartlett (Bartlett@wrl.dec.com), Marc Feeley
(Feeley@iro.umontreal.ca), Guillermo Rozas (Jinx@zurich.ai.mit.edu)
and Ralph Swick (Swick@crl.dec.com) contributed time and energy to the
initial release.

======== Marlais ========

Marlais is a simple interpreter for a language strongly resembling
Dylan. It is available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.cis.ufl.edu:/pub/Marlais
   cambridge.apple.com:/pub/dylan/Marlais
   travis.csd.harris.com:/pub/ 
Currently runs on i386 and i486 (OS/2 or Linux), IBM PC/RT, IBM
RS/6000, HP9000/300, HP9000/700, DECstations (Ultrix), SGI (IRIX),
Sony News, Apple Macintosh (A/UX), Sun3, Sun4, Vax (4.3bsd and
ultrix), m88k (Harris Nighthawk running CX/UX), MIPS M/120, Sequent
Symmetry, Encore Multimax.  Contact Joe Wilson <jnw@cis.ufl.edu> or
Brent Benson <brent@ssd.csd.harris.com> for more information.

================

The Gwydion Project at CMU is developing an innovative new software
development environment based on the Dylan language (and, in the
process, will make available a very high-quality implementation of
Dylan). This project includes many of the same people responsible for
CMU Common Lisp. (In Welsh mythology, Gwydion is the uncle of Dylan
and nephew of Math.) A Mosaic page describing the project goals, how
they fit in with the Dylan language, and copies of the Dylan language
manual and latest approved design notes is available as
   http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu/gwydion/
For more information, write to gwydion-group@cs.cmu.edu.

Mindy (Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet) is a Dylan-like language from the
Gwydion Project. Mindy is intended for use as a development tool while
work on the "real" high-performance Dylan implementation progresses.
Mindy is available by anonymouse ftp from legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu as
the file /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/gwydion/release/mindy.tar.gz.
Send bug reports to gwydion-bugs@cs.cmu.edu; support will be minimal.

Subject: [4-7] What is Pearl Common Lisp?

When Apple Computer acquired Coral Software in January 1989, they
re-released Coral's Allegro Common Lisp and its optional modules as
Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp (now just Macintosh Common Lisp).
Coral's other product, Pearl Lisp, was discontinued at that time.
Pearl Lisp provides a subset of the functionality of MACL 1.3 and is
not even fully CLtL1-compatible (e.g., the implementation of defstruct is
different).

Despite rumors to the contrary, Pearl Lisp is not and never was public
domain. Nevertheless, Pearl Lisp and its documentation were placed in
the "Moof:Goodies:Pearl Lisp" folder on the first pressing of "Phil
and Dave's Excellent CD", the precursor to the current Apple
Developer's CD-ROM series.  Apple removed Pearl from later versions of
the developer CD-ROM distribution because of complaints from other
Lisp vendors. If you own a copy of Pearl Lisp or a copy of this
CD-ROM, you can make it runnable under System 7 with some slight
modifications using ResEdit.  To repeat, Pearl Lisp is NOT public
domain, so you must own a copy to use it.

To make it runnable, one needs to use ResEdit to make changes to the
BNDL and FREF resources so that it will connect to its icons properly.
This will make it respond to double-clicks in the normal manner and
make it be properly linked to its files. Detailed instructions for
modifying Pearl Lisp using ResEdit may be obtained from the Lisp
Utilities Repository by anonymous ftp from 
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/pearl/ 
as the file pearl.txt.

After you've made the changes, it will run under System 7 on 68000s
and 68030s if you turn off 32-bit addressing. It seems to bomb on a
Quadra.

If you need a more powerful Lisp or one that is compatible with the
standard for Common Lisp, consider purchasing Macintosh Common Lisp.

Subject: [4-9] What Lisp-related discussion groups and mailing lists exist?
     
Before posting to any discussion group, please read the rest
of this FAQ, to make sure your question isn't already answered. 

Scheme-related mailing lists and newsgroups are listed in the Scheme
FAQ, and AI-related mailing lists and newsgroups are listed in the AI FAQ.
     
First of all, there are several Lisp-related newsgroups:
   comp.lang.lisp          General Lisp-related discussions.
                           See below for archive information.

   comp.lang.clos          Discussion related to CLOS, PCL, and

   comp.org.lisp-users     Discussions related to Association of Lisp Users.
                           Gatewayed to the ALU mailing list. This is an
                           organizational mailing list/newsgroup, not a 
                           technical forum.

   comp.std.lisp           For discussion of emerging standards for
                           the Lisp language, including "de facto" standards.
			   Moderated by Brad Miller <miller@cs.rochester.edu>.
                           Submissions should be sent to 
                             lisp-standards@cs.rochester.edu

                             ftp.cs.rochester.edu:/pub/archives/lisp-standards/
                           Gatewayed to a mailing list (send mail to
                           lisp-standards-request@cs.rochester.edu to join).

   comp.lang.lisp.mcl      Discussions related to Macintosh
                           Common Lisp. This newsgroup is gatewayed
                           to the info-mcl@digitool.com
                           mailing list and archived on digitool.com.

   comp.lang.lisp.franz    Discussion of Franz Lisp, a dialect of Lisp.
                           (Note: *not* Franz Inc's Allegro.)

   comp.lang.lisp.x        Discussion of XLISP, a dialect of Lisp, and XScheme.

   comp.sys.xerox          Discussions related to using Medley (name exists
                           for historical reasons, and is likely to change
                           soon). Gatewayed to the info-1100 mailing list.

   comp.sys.ti.explorer	   TI Explorers Lisp machines.

   comp.windows.garnet     Garnet, a Lisp-based GUI.

The newsgroup comp.lang.lisp is archived on 
   ftp.gmd.de:/usenet/comp.lang.lisp/ [129.26.8.84]
by month, from 1989 onward. Individual files are in rnews
format. (They contain articles prefixed by a header line "#! rnews
<nchars> archive" where <nchars> is the number of characters in the
article following the header. That format is convenient for various
news processing programs (e.g.  relaynews) and is rather easy to
process from a lisp program too.)  A copy of the GMD archives for
comp.lang.lisp is available on cambridge.apple.com:/pub/comp.lang.lisp/.

Subject: [4-10] Where can I get a copy of the ANSI Common Lisp standard?
                What is ISO Lisp?

As of December 8, 1994, Common Lisp is now an official ANSI Standard:
ANSI X3.226:1994 American National Standard for Programming Language
Common LISP (X3J13).

Copies of the ANSI/X3.226 standard may be purchased from the
   American National Standards Institute
   11 West 42nd Street
   New York, NY 10036
For more information, visit the ANSI home page at http://www.ansi.org/

A web version of the ANSI Common Lisp standard is not available. The
official ANSI standard is available only in hardcopy form.

However, Kent Pitman (kmp@harlequin.com) of Harlequin, Inc. has, with
permission from ANSI and X3, written an HTML document that is based on
ANSI standard for Common Lisp. This version is not a definitive
reference, but is much more practical for most casual browsing.  It is
also cross-referenced against some design documents.  The document is
available for online browsing at
     http://www.harlequin.com/books/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html
Subject to some legal restrictions, you can download a copy for your
own use and get much better performance.  Visit  
     http://www.harlequin.com/books/HyperSpec/
for information on downloading your own copy.  The .tar.gz file is
just a little over 2MB, and unpacks into a set of files that is just
a little over 15MB.

Copies of the TeX sources and Unix-compressed DVI files for the *draft*
version of the standard may be obtained by anonymous FTP from 
   parcftp.xerox.com:/pub/cl/ [13.1.64.94]
The files corresponding to the second Public Review of Common Lisp are
in the directory /pub/cl/dpANS2/*. These files correspond to draft
14.10, also known as document X3J13/93-102, which was forwarded by
X3J13 to X3 in October, 1993. (The files from the first draft are in
the directory /pub/cl/dpANS1/*.) The draft is about 1500 pages long.
The file Reviewer-Notes.text should be read before ftping the other files.

For more information, write to X3 Secretariat, Attn: Lynn Barra, 1250
Eye Street NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20005-3922, call
202-626-5738, fax 202-638-4922, or send email to x3sec@itic.nw.dc.us.


The international working group on Lisp is ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG16.
Pierre Parquier (parquier@ilog.fr) is the WG16 Convenor.  Kent Pitman
(kmp@harlequin.com) is the International Representative of X3J13 to
WG16 and is also Project Editor for WG16. WG16 is working on the
design of a dialect of Lisp called ISLISP (which is neither a subset
nor a superset of Common Lisp).  A Committee Draft (CD) of the ISLISP
specification has been registered by WG16 as ``CD13816: Information
Technology - Programming languages, their environments and system
software interfaces - Programming language ISLISP.''  The CD, which
WG16 internally refers to as version 15.6, is available by anonymous
FTP from
   ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de:/pub/lisp/islisp/  [129.13.115.2]
in the directory islisp-15.6/.
The draft has passed its first CD letter ballot. A second WG16 letter
ballot will be held to determine whether this Committee Draft will
become a Draft International Standard (DIS); this is expected to
happen by April 1996.
