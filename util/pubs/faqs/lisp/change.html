;;; Removed: Don Vines not longer at NEC, so nobody at NEC is
;;; providing support for the CLOS binding of CORBA.
CORBA:

   The CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) specification's
   Dynamic Invocation Interfaces (DII) are a collection of interfaces for
   writing extensible, distributed object applications.  NEC Systems
   Laboratory Inc. has contributed both C and CLOS implementations of
   these specification to the Object Management Group (OMG). The CORBA
   specification (91-8-1) is available free to OMG members, and for $50
   to non-members. To order the document, send mail to documents@omg.org,
   or write to OMG, 492 Old Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA 01701, phone
   508-820-4300, fax 508-820-4303. The DII implementation can be
   retrieved via anonymous ftp from omg.org:/pub/ [192.67.184.64] as the
   file NEC_DII/93-1-2.tar.Z. There are three dependencies in the
   contributed DII implementations.  First, the CLOS images require an
   Allegro CL license due to its use of the Lisp foreign function
   interface.  Second, the C executables require Sun SparcStations, but
   they can be re-compiled and re-linked for other architectures.  Third,
   the implementation of the `Invoke' DII interface is considered
   proprietary.  For further information, write to Don Vines, NEC Systems
   Laboratory, Inc., C&C Software Technology Center (CSTC), 1901 Gateway
   Drive, Irving, Texas 75038, call 214-518-3486, fax 214-518-3552, or
   send email to dvines@syl.dl.nec.com.
