Subject: [1-0] Introduction

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Prolog and logic programming.
This file/article is an attempt to gather these questions and their
answers into a convenient reference for Prolog programmers.  It (or a
reference to it) is posted periodically.  The hope is that this will
cut down on the user time and network bandwidth used to post, read and
respond to the same questions over and over, as well as providing
education by answering questions some readers may not even have
thought to ask.

This guide lists Prolog and logic programming resources: archives,
newsgroups, books, magazines, compilers, interpreters and anything
else you can think of which has to do with the proliferation of Prolog
and logic programming. Also included is a list of suppliers of
products and a list of publishers. Topics can also include
unification, backtracking search, and other aspects of logic
programming. As Prolog has a strong historical tradition in Europe,
we've tried to ensure that the information is relevant to all readers,
including European and North American.

This is not a Prolog tutorial, nor is it an exhaustive list of all Prolog
intricacies.  Prolog is a very powerful and expressive language, but with
that power comes many complexities.  This list attempts to address the
ones that average Prolog programmers are likely to encounter.  If you are
new to Prolog, read one of the introductions listed in the answer to
question [1-3].

Please do not post homework questions to the comp.lang.prolog
newsgroup. You won't learn anything if somebody else does the problem
for you, and won't get any credit for your answer if your instructor
reads the newsgroup. 

Please also avoid starting the debate on which language is better;
Prolog or Lisp, Prolog or C, and so on. Such discussions are rarely
productive, and nobody will change their opinion as a result of the
debate. The usual conclusion of such debates is that the languages are
Turing equivalent, but some languages are better suited for particular
tasks. For Prolog, the consensus is that it is a good choice for
problems involving logic and problems whose solution can be
represented or characterized succinctly in logical form. Some folks
feel Prolog is the best language for natural language processing;
others disagree.

The comp.lang.prolog newsgroup is archived in
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.lang.prolog/
on a weekly basis.

This guide is posted regularly to comp.lang.prolog and comp.object.logic. 
It may also be obtained by anonymous ftp from

Subject:  [1-1]  Sources of Information about Prolog

The newsgroups comp.lang.prolog, comp.object.logic, and (to a lesser
extent) comp.ai are a source of information and discussion about Prolog. 
See also sci.logic. The newsgroup comp.constraints is for information
about constraint processing languages and related topics. 

A "Frequently Asked Questions" posting is posted to comp.lang.prolog
twice a month by Jamie Andrews <jamie@cs.sfu.ca>. The Prolog FAQ and this
Prolog Resource Guide are intended to complement one another.

   this book takes a more pragmatic (as opposed to theoretical approach) and
   shows the reader how to assemble complete Prolog programs.

Subject: [1-5] FTP Archives and Other Resources

The following are achives that contain Prolog-related material, such as
code, interpreters, articles, etc. Most of the archives are ftp sites.
They are listed by domain.name and [IP Address]. To access them and
download programs type at the prompt: 

        ftp <site name> (or IP address)
        login: "anonymous",
        password: your own return email address,
        cd <directory>, ls to see files, 
        set binary, 
        get <filename> to transfer file to your system
        stop with quit or exit

Deviations from this general scheme may occur but the above should
work in most cases.

CMU AI Repository, Prolog Section:

   The Prolog Section of the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository
   (aka "The Prolog Repository") is accessible by anonymous ftp to
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/ [128.2.206.173]
   through the AFS directory
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/prolog/
   or by WWW from the URL   
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html
   and includes more than 110 megabytes of sources and other materials
   of interest to Prolog programmers, including all freely
   distributable implementations and many programs. The contents of the 
   CMU AI Repository has been keyword indexed to provide convenient
   browsing of the contents.

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys prolog gui
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.  
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else in 
   the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is in the
   works.  We also plan to make the source code (including indexes) to
   this program available, as soon as it is stable.

   Most of the Prolog Section of the AI Repository appears on Prime Time 
   Freeware for AI, Issue 1-1, a mixed-media book/CD-ROM publication. It
   includes two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs bound into a 224 page book and sells
   (list) for US$60 plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. For more
   information write to Prime Time Freeware, 370 Altair Way, Suite 150,
   Sunnyvale, CA  94086  USA, call 408-433-9662, 408-433-0727 (fax),
   or send email to ptf@cfcl.com.

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/
   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to
      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu
   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   The Prolog Section of the AI Repository is maintained by Mark Kantrowitz 
   <AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu>. 

Artificial Intelligence Programs:
   ai.uga.edu:/pub/ [128.192.12.9]

   The University of Georgia AI FTP Library contains public domain
   Prologs, such as Open Prolog and ESL PD Prolog, PrEd (a small text
   editor for Prolog), and some miscellaneous prolog programs in
      ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog/
   A copy of the programs from the book by Covington, Nute, and Vellino, (see
   the section on Books below), is in
      ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog.book/
   and the draft ISO standard for prolog is in
      ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog.standard/

   Maintained by Michael Covington <mcovingt@ai.uga.edu>.

ALE:     
   ALE (Attribute Logic Engine), a freeware system written in
   Prolog, integrates phrase structure parsing and constraint logic
   programming with typed feature structures as terms.  Types are
   arranged in an inheritance hierarchy and specified for the features
   and value types for which they are appropriate.  Grammars may also
   interleave unification steps with logic program goal calls (as can be
   done in DCGs), thus allowing parsing to be interleaved with other
   system components.  While ALE was developed to handle HPSG grammars,
   it can also execute PATR-II grammars, DCG grammars, Prolog, Prolog-II,
   and LOGIN programs, etc. Grammars and programs are specified with a
   version of Rounds-Kasper Attribute Value Logic with macros and
   variables.  ALE supports lexical rules and empty categories for
   grammars, using a bottom-up, all-paths dynamic chart parser. ALE
   supports last call optimization, negation by failure and cuts in
   definite clauses, which may be used independently or integrated into
   grammars. The system is distributed with several sample grammars,
   including a fairly comprehensive implementation of a head-driven
   phrase structure grammar for English. Version 2.0 of ALE is
   available free for research purposes by anonymous ftp from 
      j.gp.cs.cmu.edu:/usr1/carp/ftp/
   as the files ale.*, or from the CMU AI Repository in
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/code/parsing/ale/
   For more information write to Bob Carpenter <carp@lcl.cmu.edu> or
   Gerald Penn <penn@lcl.cmu.edu>.

ALP-UK Library:
   The best Prolog library currently is the one collected by the ALP-UK
   group. It is available to members at 30 pounds sterling for a Sun
   cartridge or 2 pounds/IBM DOS disk. (non-members maybe, how much?) It
   contains MBs of Prolog systems (including SB Prolog), libraries
   (including the Edinburgh library), benchmarks, grammars, theorem provers,
   object and graphics systems etc. For more information, write to ALP-UK
   Library, Sanjay Raina, Librarian, Dept. of Computer Science, University
   of Bristol, University Walk, Bristol BS8 1TR, UK, call +44 0272 303030
   x3304, or send email to raina@compsci.bristol.ac.uk.

CASLOG
   CASLOG (Complexity Analysis System for LOGic) is an experimental
   semi-automatic complexity analysis system for logic programs. It can
   perform the worst-case analysis for complexity measures: argument size
   complexity, number of solutions complexity, and time complexity.

   CASLOG extends the techniques developed for analyzing imperative and
   functional languages to deal with nondeterminism and generation of
   multiple solutions via backtracking in logic languages. The analyses
   for different complexity measures are implemented in a unified
   framework and share several common features. First, the predicates in
   a program are processed in an order generated by a bottom-up
   topological sorting over the call graph of the program. Second, the
   complexity function for a predicate is derived from the complexity
   function of its clauses by using the information about the mutual
   exclusion relationships between its clauses. Third, the complexity
   function for a clause is inferred based on the data dependency
   relationships between its literals. Fourth, the complexity functions
   for recursive clauses are in the form of difference equations and are
   transformed into closed form functions using difference equation
   solving techniques. This unified framework can simplify proofs of
   correctness and the implementation of the algorithms.

   CASLOG is available by anonymous ftp from cs.arizona.edu:/caslog/. This
   is an alpha distribution, and includes CASLOG version 1.0, a
   preliminary user manual, a paper on CASLOG, and a set of examples.
   For more information, contact Nai-Wei Lin <naiwei@cs.arizona.edu>.

Constraint Programming Paper Archive:
   Aarhus University, Denmark, has established an anonymous ftp archive
   for papers on "Constraint Programming" at ftp.daimi.aau.dk:/pub/CLP/.
   For further information, contact Brian H. Mayoh <brian@daimi.aau.dk>.

CSP:

   Some constraint-related papers by a research group at the
   University of Washington are available by anonymous ftp from 
      june.cs.washington.edu:/pub/constraints/papers/
   The papers from the 1994 Principles and Practice of Constraint
   Programming Workshop are available in
      june.cs.washington.edu:/pub/constraints/papers/ppcp94/
   There are also implementations of several constraint satisfaction
   algorithms and constraint-based systems, including the DeltaBlue and
   SkyBlue algorithms, the Multi-Garnet user interface toolkit, ThingLab
   II, and CoolDraw (a constraint-based drawing system), in
   subdirectories of 
      june.cs.washington.edu:/pub/constraints/code/
   The ftp archive is also accessible via WWW:
      http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/archive/constraints/constraints.html
   All the source code is in the public domain. For more information,
   write to Alan Borning <borning@geoduck.cs.washington.edu>.

   C implementations of a number of constraint satisfaction algorithms
   are available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cs.ualberta.ca:/pub/ai/csp/
   Get the files README and csplib.tar.Z.  The algorithms include
   variations on backtracking (backjumping, backmarking, chronological
   backtracking, etc.), local consistency preprocessing algorithms (e.g.,
   arc consistency), and random problem generators. For more information,
   write to Peter van Beek <vanbeek@cs.ualberta.ca>.

Eden:
   Eden is a Poplog-based AI microworld developed by Simon Perkins,
   Jocelyn Paine and Edmund Chattoe of the Oxford University Artificial
   Intelligence Society. It is intended to serve as a testbed for
   learning and planning programs. Programs written in Pop-11, Prolog,
   Lisp, and ML control a "bug" that lives in a 2-dimensional world. Any
   kind of algorithm may be used to control the bug, including genetic
   algorithms, neural nets, and rule-based systems. Eden consists of a
   grid of cells, each of which can contain objects such as keys, doors,
   boulders and quicksand. Bug's objective is to find and eat a piece of
   food which the simulator has placed somewhere within this grid. To do
   this, Bug must negotiate its way towards the food while dealing
   intelligently with obstacles. Eden's laws of physics allow Bug to take
   one of several different actions when it encounters an object. The
   simulator then works out the consequences of the chosen action on Bug
   and on Eden, and displays these graphically in a Ved window. Bug's
   perceptions are updated to reflect the new state of the world, and the
   cycle repeats. Eden is available by anonymous ftp from the Imperial
   College archive in
      src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/packages/prolog-pd-software/ [146.169.2.10] 
   as the file eden.tar.Z. (Note: This is really a link to the
   directory computing/programming/languages/prolog/pd-software/.)
   Eden includes PopBeast, a simple Prolog bug which can read and
   parse simple commands, extract their meaning, plan how to satisfy
   these commands, and then carry out the plans.

   Parts of the current Eden are coded in Pop-11, so porting it to
   Prologs other than Poplog will require some effort. Most of the
   recoding needed is in the grid-world simulator and the definition of
   objects. Send mail to Jocelyn Paine <popx@vax.oxford.ac.uk> if
   you're willing to try this. 

FW_Rules:

   FW_RULES is a Sicstus Prolog library providing a compiler for forward
   chaining rules.  The implementation is based on a non-state saving
   technique coupled with an indexing mechanism on the working memory
   based on C bitwise operations to achieve efficiency. The library
   supports interoperability between the forward chaining language and
   the underlying Prolog engine.  Terms in the working memory are
   represented as Prolog facts and can be accessed from Prolog to perform
   deduction. It is available by anonymous FTP from
      ftp.cs.unibo.it:/pub/gaspari/fw_rules/
   as the files README and fw_rules.tar.Z. For more information,
   please write to Mauro Gaspari <gaspari@cs.unibo.it>.

HDRUG:

   Hdrug is an environment to develop logic grammars, parsers, and
   generators for natural languages.  The package comes with a number of
   example grammars, including a Categorial Grammar, a Tree Adjoining
   Grammar, a Unification Grammar in the spirit of Head-driven Phrase
   Structure Grammar, an Extraposition Grammar, a Definite Clause
   Grammar, and a port of the HPSG grammar from Bob Carpenter's ALE
   system. Each of the grammars comes with a set of parsers, such as 
   Earley-like chart parsers, left-corner parsers and head-driven
   parsers. Some grammars come with variants of the head-driven
   generator. The package allows easy comparison of different
   parsers/generators, extensive possibilities of compiling feature
   equations into Prolog terms, graphical (Tk), LaTeX and ordinary Prolog
   output of trees, feature structures and Prolog terms, and plotted
   graphs and tables of statistical information. Hdrug runs in Sicstus
   Prolog and requires ProTcl and Tcl/Tk. It is available by anonymous
   FTP from
      tyr.let.rug.nl:/pub/prolog-app/Hdrug/
   or by WWW from
      http://tyr.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/prolog-app/Hdrug/
   For more information, write to Gertjan van Noord <vannoord@let.rug.nl>.

Logic Programming Bibliographies:
   duck.dfki.uni-sb.de:/pub/lp-proceedings/ [134.96.188.92]

   The ftp server supports tar'ing on the fly, so if you type "get
   bibtex.tar" you will get a tar'ed version of the "bibtex" directory.

   BibTeX entries for the proceedings of the following conferences
   are included: SLP84-87,91, NACLP89-90, ILPS91, ICLP82,84,86-91,93,
      JICLP92, LP88, RTA89,93, PLILP90-92, ALPUK91, ICOT92, ALP90,92,
      CADE90,92, CTRS90,92, LICS86-91, UNIF89, EPIA89,91,93, TACS91,
      TAPSOFT93, EAIA90, FGCS92, FAC, ILPS93, PEPM91,93
   and the following journals: JLP85-93, JAR91-93, JSC91-93, IANDC82-92.

   The bibliography is mirrored by the Universidade Nova de Lisboa.
   In addition, the bibliography can be searched using either WAIS or
   GOPHER. To search the lp-proceedings using WAIS, use the
      lp-proceedings.src 
   wais source, available from the directory of servers. To search the
   lp-proceedings using GOPHER, point the client to gopher.fct.unl.pt,
   and follow the directories 
      "Research/Bibliography/Logic Programming Proceedings".
   Searching should be easier than retrieving the entire package every
   time you want to locate a particular article.

   Send comments and bug reports to rscheidhauer@dfki.uni-sb.de.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. 
   All algorithms are written in Edinburgh Prolog syntax. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 
   The programs are currently available via anonymous ftp-server from
   the GMD: 

        ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/ML-Program-Library/ [129.26.8.84]

   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe, 
   Projektgruppe KIT, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Franklinstr. 28/29,
   10629 Berlin, Germany. Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated
   3.5 inch floppy (double, high and extra-high density),  which should
   be included with your request. You can also get them by sending an email
   message to Thomas Hoppe (see below).

   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems
   to Thomas Hoppe, <hoppet@cs.tu-berlin.de>. Send suggestions and
   complaints about the ftp library to Werner Emde, Gesellschaft
   fuer Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung, Bonn, <emde@gmd.de>. 


Natural Language Processing in Prolog:

   The Prolog and DCG programs from Pereira and Shieber's book, "Prolog
   and Natural Language Analysis", are available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.das.harvard.edu:/pub/shieber/pnla/. See the file README for the
   conditions under which the material is distributed. If you retrieve
   the files, please send an email message to the authors letting them
   know how you plan to use them. For further information, write to
   Fernando Pereira <pereira@research.att.com> or Stuart Shieber
   <shieber@das.harvard.edu>.

Parser:
   A parser for standard Prolog text written in C is available by
   anonymous ftp from
      trappist.elis.rug.ac.be:/pub/prolog/
   It consists of only three modules (tokenizer, parser, and display
   routine) and an interface module to integrate it with an existing
   Prolog system. It is completely deterministic and about 10 times
   faster than O'Keefe's public domain parser written in Prolog.
   For more information, write to Koen De Bosschere <kdb@elis.rug.ac.be>.

Partial Evaluation:

   Prolog code for the partial evaluator for the flowchart language
   described in Ch. 4 of "Partial Evaluation and Automatic Program
   Generation" by Jones, Gomard and Sestoft is available for anonymous
   ftp from 
      ftp.diku.dk:/pub/diku/dists/jones-book/ch4_pl.tar.Z
   All three Futamura projections are implemented. The code has been
   tested under SWI Prolog 1.5 and 1.7 and should hopefully port to other
   prologs without too many problems.  For more information, please
   contact Zerksis Umrigar <umrigar@cs.binghamton.edu>.

Pleuk Grammar Development System:

   Pleuk is intended to be a shell for grammar development, in that many
   different grammatical formalisms can be embedded within it.
   Grammatical formalisms that currently work with Pleuk include CFG (a
   simple context-free grammar system), HPSG-PL (a system for developing
   HPSG-style grammars, produced at Simon Fraser University, Canada, by
   Fred Popowich, Sandi Kodric and Carl Vogel), Mike (a simple
   graph-based unification system, enhanced with additional operations
   for the treatment of free word order proposed by Mike Reape in various
   publications), SLE (a graph-based formalism enhanced with arbitrary
   relations in the manner of Johnson & Rosner and Doerre & Eisele.
   Delayed evaluation is used to compute infinite relations.  This system
   has been used for the development of several HPSG-style grammars) and
   Term (a term-based unification grammar system, originally developed
   for the support of Unification Categorial Grammar of Zeevat, Klein and
   Calder). Sample grammars are provided for all of these formalisms.
   Work continues apace on other formalisms, including Bob Carpenter's
   Ale system for typed feature structures, and Veronica Dahl's Static
   Discontinuity Grammars.

Prolog to SQL Compiler:
   The Prolog to SQL Compiler translates database access requests,
   which consist of a projection term and a database goal, to the
   appropriate SQL query. The compiler is written in standard Edinburgh
   Prolog and has been ported to a number of Prologs. The code posted to
   comp.lang.prolog works in ECRC's SEPIA Prolog, but should be easily
   ported to other Prologs. A detailed tech report on the implementation
   is available by email from draxler@cis.uni-muenchen.de (include
   your full postal address). The compiler is copyright, but may be used
   free of charge for non-commercial purposes and redistributed provided
   the copyright notice is retained intact.

PSI:
   PSI is a handy system for the management and retrieval of your
   personal data, be it addresses, CD collections, or bibliographic
   references. It is intended for the non-commercial user. It may not be
   as full-fledged as some data-base systems, but has some features that
   you won't find in most commercial systems. Also, you may find it
   easier to set up and faster to use. PSI is useful for a broad range of
   data. Indexing with descriptors makes searching for the data you need
   fast, and the interface to other data-base formats (import and export)
   is quite powerful. PSI was written in LPA MacProlog and is a "genuine
   'double clickable' Mac application". PSI runs on all Macs with System
   6 or 7 in 1MB of main memory. As LPA MacProlog isn't yet 32-bit clean,
   PSI isn't either. Extensive documentation and some examples are
   included. PSI is available by anonymous ftp from
   sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/app/ as the file psi-23.hqx. It
   was also available on a recent Nautilus CD-ROM and will be on the
   first Info-Mac CD-ROM.

SEL:
   SEL is a declarative set processing language. Its main features are
   subset and equational program clauses, pattern matching over sets,
   support for efficient iteration and point-wise/incremental computation
   over sets, the ability to define transitive closures through circular
   constraints, meta-programming and simple higher-order programming, and
   a modest user-interface including tracing. The language seems
   well-suited to a number of problems in graph theory, program analysis,
   and discrete mathematics. The SEL compiler is written in Quintus
   Prolog and the run-time system is written in C. It generates WAM-like
   code, extended to deal with set-matching, memoization, and the novel
   control structure of the language. SEL is available by anonymous FTP
   from ftp.cs.buffalo.edu:/users/bharat/SEL2/.  The FTP release comes with a
   user manual, bibliography of papers (including .dvi files), several
   sample programs, and source code. For further information, write to

Subject: [1-6] Free Object-Oriented Systems for Prolog

OL(P), Object Layer for Prolog, is an object-oriented extension to
Prolog.  It provides an object-oriented structuring and reuse
mechanism for Prolog in a manner that preserves performance and
semantics. The object-oriented layer is compiled into Prolog without
introducing any side-effects.  OL(P) takes the view of objects as
collections of predicates (called methods).  To Prolog, OL(P) 1.1 adds
objects with methods, data encapsulation, instances, and multiple
inheritance. Object methods can access Prolog predicates and vice
versa. The OL(P) incremental compiler translates OL(P) programs to
Prolog programs that don't need runtime interpretation (e.g., no
search is needed for inheritance).  OL(P) 1.1 comes with prepared
installation for SICStus Prolog and QUINTUS Prolog (both on UNIX),
documentation, simple built-in project management, some libraries,
and example programs. The source is included, so you can port OL(P)
to different platforms, different Prolog systems, and different
logic programming languages. OL(P) is available by anonymous ftp
from parcftp.xerox.com:/ftp/pub/ol/ [13.1.64.94]. Written by Markus
P.J. Fromherz <fromherz@parc.xerox.com>. 

LogTalk is a free object oriented extension to the Prolog programming
language. It is based on a reflexive architecture intended to provide
an open system, easily tailored to user needs. It implements simple
inheritance and a delegation mechanism. Logtalk enables users to
define new types of slots, each one with its own semantics, that can
be reused by any object. It includes features for event-based
programming. This enables the creation of elegant solutions to
represent and maintain relations that restrict the internal state of
participating objects. Logtalk (and more information about it) is
available using the URL

XPCE:
   XPCE is an object-oriented X-window interface toolkit for symbolic
   programming languages (Prolog and Lisp), offering a high level of
   abstraction for communication with X11, Unix processes, Unix
   networking facilities (sockets) and Unix files. XPCE's built-in
   classes (about 150) are mostly written in C.  The XPCE/Prolog
   interface allows the user to create and manipulate instances of these
   classes.  The user can also create new XPCE classes from Prolog.
   XPCE's window related classes provide various styles of menus,
   primitive graphical objects, compound graphical objects and Emacs
   oriented programmable text manipulation windows. The distribution
   contains several demo programs, including a diagram drawing tool
   (PceDraw), an animation demo, an Epoch-like editor, a graphical

Subject: [1-10] Is there a straight-forward way of compiling Prolog to C?

Two methods of compiling Prolog to C have been reported in the
literature:
   -  WAM-based approaches
   -  Continuation-based approaches

The WAM-based approach compiles Prolog programs into a sequence of C
function or macro calls to WAM instructions. A brief description of
this method and some results are given in the paper:

   Michael R. Levy and R. Nigel Horspool, "Translating Prolog to C: a
   WAM-based Approach", in Proceedings of the Second Compulog Network
   Area Meeting on Programming Languages, and the Workshop on Logic
   Languages in Pisa, May 1993. (Available by anonymous ftp from 
   csr.uvic.ca:/pub/mlevy/.)

The best tutorial for writing a WAM-based compiler or WAM emulator is
Hassan Ait-Kaci's book, "Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial
Reconstruction" (see [1-3] above). 

A "quick-and-dirty" method is to implement the WAM functions as described
in Ait-Kaci's tutorial, to label each call with a C case label, and then throw
a giant switch(P) statement around the entire sequence of calls, where P
is the WAM program counter.  On return from any instruction that modifies
P, a "goto Start" must be inserted. (This method was posted by Rob
Scott, <rbs@aisb.ed.ac.uk>, based on the JANUS papers by Saraswat.)

This strategy will work, but does not allow you to modularize your
prolog program. Predicates in prolog seem to generate 8 to 15 WAM
instructions per clause, so (assuming very roughly a clause per
line)you might expect your 1,000 line program to expand to a switch
statement containing up to 15,000 lines. Some C compilers can't handle
such a big switch statement.

Levy and Horspool solve this problem by compiling each Prolog
predicate to a seperate C function. A dispatch loop mechanism is used
to call the C functions. C switch statements are used only inside the
functions.  A predicate that calls another predicate sets P to contain
the address of the C function that implements the called predicate,
(and sets another register called W in their scheme) and then returns
to the dispatcher instead of calling the predicate. This bypasses the
C run-time stack.  This lets one exploit WAM optimizations (like LCO)
and yet retain the ability to create many modules. Their system
performs well when compared with byte-code compilers, but translated
code runs slower than code produced by native code compilers.  On the
other hand, it outputs portable ANSI C that can run on any machine
with a C compiler.

Henderson, Somogyi, and Conway's paper "Compiling Logic Programs to C
using GNU C as a portable assembler" 
   htpp://www.cs.mu.oz.au/mercury/papers.html
mentions some optimizations to the above approach, and also describes
another approach used in the Mercury compiler which achieves
efficiency comparable to direct native-code generation by using GNU C
extensions.  They use conditional compilation (#ifdef) to enable use
of these extensions, so the generated C code will still run on other
ANSI C compilers, although the GNU C extensions improve performance
for Mercury by nearly a factor of three.

Other approaches to translating to C use continuations. The idea here
is to translate every Prolog predicate to a C function that has
an additional argument, namely a continuation function. If the function
fails, it simply returns, but if it succeeds, it executes the continuation.
When the function regains control from the continuation, it can then try
to generate a new solution. Here are two references
that describe systems built using continuations:

   J. L. Weiner and S. Ramakrishnan, "A Piggy-Back Compiler for Prolog",
   in Proceedings of SIGPLAN T88 Conference on Programming Language
   Design and Implementation, Atlanta, Georgia, 1988, pages 288-296.

   J. L. Boyd and G. M. Karam, "Prolog in C", Carleton University,
   Ottawa, 1988. 

Oliver Ridoux <Olivier.Ridoux@irisa.fr> reports that a
continuation-based approach works well when used to compile
LambdaProlog. His scheme translates every predicate into a function
that uses and modifies the success and failure continuations, with
recursion in the predicate becoming iteration in the continuation
passing mechanism. Inside the function one uses whichever intermediate
machine one fancies. Clauses within the function can be either the
branches of a switch statement or simply labelled when using a C
system that can store labels. This approach can still generate
monstrous C programs that blow up the C compiler, but the C programs
aren't as large as those generated by a one module to a function
scheme. Approaches that replace recursion in a predicate with
recursion in a function tend to overload the C stack and lead to
sloppy memory management.  Two technical reports describing Ridoux's
approach are available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.irisa.fr:/local/
as pm/*.ps.Z and mailv06/*.ps.Z.

Michael Covington <mcovingt@ai.uga.edu> points out that a very simple
approach is to write a Prolog interpreter in C, then store the Prolog
program in that program's data! This will, of course, execute slowly.
One might imagine all sorts of other schemes. For example, a query
could be treated as a stack of "suspensions" (with the left-most goal
on top).  The top suspension is executed by selecting the appropriate
clause (possibly using indexing), and then, if necessary, pushing new
suspensions on the stack (the body of the clause whose head unified
with the current suspension).

Another question to ask is this: Is there any reason why you should want to
convert Prolog to C at all? George Saab of Quintus Corp. pointed out that,
with Quintus Prolog, you can create a standard .o file from a Prolog file,
which can then be linked with your other .o files to create an executable.
What's more, your Prolog code can be called from C code and vice versa.

On ther hand, the advantage of distributing "Prolog objects" as C rather than
.o files is portability.

M. Gaspari  and G. Attardi describe an approach to translating Prolog to C
based on the provision of a common runtime architecture. This is
described in 

   G. Attardi and M. Gaspari, "Multilanguage Interoperability", in
   Proceedings of The 3rd International Symposium, PLILP 91, 
   Springer Verlag, LNCS #528, 1991.

Subject: [1-12] What is the Basic Andorra Model and AKL?

The Basic Andorra Model is a way to execute definite clause programs
that allows dependent and-parallelism to be exploited transparently.
It also supports nice programming techniques for search programs.  The
idea is to first reduce all goals that match at most one clause.  When
no such goal exists, any goal (e.g., the left-most) may be chosen.
The BAM was proposed by David H. D. Warren, and his group at Bristol
has developed an AND-OR parallel implementation called Andorra-I,
which also supports full Prolog.  See, for example, 

   Seif Haridi and Per Brand, "Andorra Prolog, an integration of Prolog
   and committed choice languages", in Proceedings of the FGCS 1988,
   ICOT, Tokyo, 1988.

   the Andorra-I engine and preprocessor", in Proceedings of the 8th
   ICLP. MIT Press, 1991.

   Andorra-I", in Proceedings of FGCS'92. ICOT, Tokyo, 1992.

AKL (Andorra Kernel Language) is a concurrent constraint programming
language that supports both Prolog-style programming and committed
choice programming.  Its control of don't-know nondeterminism is based
on the Andorra model, which has been generalised to also deal with
nondeterminism encapsulated in guards and aggregates (such as bagof)
in a concurrent setting. See, for example,

   Kernel Language", in Proceedings of ILPS'91. MIT Press, 1991.

Subject: [1-13] What is Constraint Logic Programming?

Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) augments Prolog by adding
constraints to the clauses. The CLP implementation solves goals in the
same manner as Prolog, but also merges the constraints associated with
each rule. If the merge succeeds, the successful goal and the
corresponding constraints are returned. If, however, the constraints
are mutually exclusive, the solution fails.

There is an extensive wide-ranging archive of material relating to
constraint logic programming at
   http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/archive/constraints/constraints.html

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-14] How do you write portable programs in Prolog?

The de-facto standard syntax for Prolog is known as the Edinburgh
standard. It is based on the syntax of DEC-10 Prolog, an early Prolog
implementation developed at the University of Edinburgh.
See question [1-1] for information on the draft ISO standard for
Prolog.

Unfortunately, not every Prolog implementation is Edinburgh compatible.
There also isn't any notion of read-conditionalization, like #+ and #-
*features* in Common Lisp. 

One option is to use the C preprocessor on Prolog code before loading
it into Prolog.  Or you could use term-expansion to roll your own
conditional compilation system. Term expanding a clause to []
effectively discards it.

Another possibility is to conditionalize the execution instead of the
compilation. The user would have to uncomment a line like one of the
following, 
   % this_is(quintus).
   % this_is(sicstus).    
and the code would have to test for the proper literal
   a :- this_is(quintus), blah, blah, blah.
   a :- this_is(sicstus), blah, blah, blah.
at a slight cost in efficiency. (If you first feed the program through
a general partial evaluator, you'll get an equivalent program without
the inefficiency. Partial evaluation is in some sense a more powerful
and semantically cleaner form of source preprocessing. Given

<head> :- <condition>, <rest of body>.
If <condition> is always false, we can safely drop the clause. If
<condition> is always true, we can drop it from any clauses that
include it.)

Prolog. It was posted to comp.lang.prolog on 1-SEP-94; a copy can be

Subject: [1-15] World-Wide Web (WWW) Resources

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia document that spans the
Internet.  It uses the http (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the
light-weight exchange of files over the Internet.  NCSA Mosaic is a
World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). 

Mosaic's popularity derives, in part, from its ability to communicate
using more traditional Internet protocols like FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
NNTP, in addition to http. Mosaic can display text, hypertext links,
and inlined graphics directly. When Mosaic encounters a file type it
can't handle internally, such as Postscript documents, mpeg movies,
sound files, and JPEG images, it uses an external viewer (or player)
like Ghostscript to handle the file. Mosaic also includes facilities
for exploring the Internet. In other words, Mosaic is an multimedia
interface to the Internet.

The hypertext documents viewed with Mosaic are written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).  All that is needed is just a few more
improvements, such as the ability to format tables and mathematics,
and a WYSIWYG editor, for HTML to greatly facilitate electronic
journals and other publications.

NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is available by anonymous ftp from  
   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Mosaic/

Subject: [1-16] Prolog Job Postings

The PROLOG-JOBS mailing list exists to help programmers find Prolog
programming positions, and to help companies with Prolog programming
positions find capable Prolog programmers. (Prolog here means Prolog-like
languages, including logic programming languages.)

Material appropriate for the list includes Prolog job announcements and
should be sent to ai+prolog-jobs@cs.cmu.edu. Resumes should NOT be sent to
the list. 

[Note: The 'ai+' part of the mailing list name is used for directing
submissions to the appropriate mail-server. The list is NOT restricted
to AI-related Prolog jobs -- all Prolog job announcements are welcome.]

As a matter of policy, the contents of this mailing list is
considered confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

To subscribe, send a message to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   subscribe prolog-jobs <First Name> <Last Name>, <Affiliation/Organization>
in the message body.

(If your mailer objects to the "+", send subscription requests to
"ai+query"@cs.cmu.edu, job announcements to "ai+prolog-jobs"@cs.cmu.edu, 
etc.) 

For help on using the query server, send mail to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   help
in the message body.

Job postings sent to the list are automatically archived in
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/prolog/

If you have any other questions, please send them to ai+@cs.cmu.edu

Subject: [1-19] The ISO Standard for Prolog and other Prolog standards

The ISO standard for Prolog is ISO/IEC 13211-1:1995. Copies can be
purchased from national standards bodies (e.g. ANSI, AFNOR, DIN). 
It defines the core features of Prolog: part 2, in preparation, 
will define modules. ISO does not currently make standards available 
by anonymous FTP, but the 1993 draft ISO standard for Prolog is
available by anonymous FTP from
   ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog.standard/ [128.192.12.9]
An unofficial summary of the ISO Prolog standard is available
from the same location as isoprolog.tex or isoprolog.ps.Z.  Send mail
to Michael Covington <mcovingt@ai.uga.edu> for more information about
his summary of the standard. 

A PostScript version of the August 1995 draft for Part 2 is
available from
   http://www.sju.edu/~jhodgson/x3j17.html

For more information about the ISO Prolog standardzation, write to
Roger Scowen, ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG17 (Prolog) convener, 9 Birchwood
Grove, HAMPTON, Middlesex TW12 3DU, UNITED KINGDOM, 
phone +44-181-979-7429, fax +44-181-287-3810, 
or, preferably, send email to rss@ditc.npl.co.uk.

Richard O'Keefe's 1984 Prolog standard draft is available by anonymous
FTP from
