G2 is a real-time expert system shell that runs on workstations and
personal computers. It has real-time temporal reasoning, with rules,
procedures, and functions built around an object-oriented paradigm.
One can interface, both locally and over a network (TCP/IP and
DECnet), to other programs (C and ADA), control systems, and
databases.  G2 provides distributed computing and a multi-user
client/server architecture.  For more information, write to Gensym

GEST (Generic Expert System Tool) Version 4.0 is a flexible expert
system shell applicable to a variety of problem domains.  Its
knowledge representation schemes include facts, frames, rules, and
procedures.  It supports forward and backward inferencing with
multiple options for each and message handling for frame objects.
There is a time system to support an event history and reverting back
to a previous state.  In addition, there is support for fuzzy logic
and certainty factor maintenance.  Features new to V4.0 include a
blackboard architecture (single level and hierarchical) with a control
module and knowledge sources.  The user interface utilizes the
Symbolics windowing system and is menu and mouse driven.  GEST can be
embedded in a user program (with or without the GEST user interface)
by using a library of function calls.  The printed reference manual
includes a tutorial, table of contents, and thorough index.  GEST runs
only on Symbolics Lisp Machines, Genera 7.2.  GEST users are expected
to be familiar with Symbolics machines.  Source and object files are
available by anonymous ftp to ftp.gatech.edu in the (binary) file
pub/ai/gest.tar.Z.  Register your copy with John Gilmore, Georgia Tech
Research Institute, ITL/CSITD 0800, Atlanta, GA 30332, USA, Internet:
john.gilmore@gtri.gatech.edu.  Send your name, address, organization,
phone number, and Internet email address.  To request a free printed
copy of the GEST manual (not in the distribution file), please also
contact John Gilmore.  Users are free to produce as many copies of the
GEST Reference Manual as they require without any restrictions.
