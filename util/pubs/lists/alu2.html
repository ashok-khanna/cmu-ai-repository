tymix.Tymnet.COM!uunet!tale requested that a new newsgroup called 'comp.org.lisp-users' be created.
It was approved by tale@uunet.uu.net



tymix.Tymnet.COM!uunet!tale says:
comp.org.lisp-users is an unmoderated newsgroup which passed its vote for
creation by 148:13 as reported in news.announce.newgroups on 10 January 1994.

For your newsgroups file:
comp.org.lisp-users	Association of Lisp Users related discussions.

The charter, culled from the call for votes:

 Discussion of general topics relevant to the Association of Lisp Users
 (ALU) (including Lisp Vendors), in particular centered on membership
 issues, future conferences, publications, and Lisp advocacy issues.
 Overlap with comp.lang.lisp.*, and other groups this message is cross-
 posted to should be minimal, as this is NOT intended to be a technical,
 but an organizational group. The ALU mailing list will be bidirectionally
 gatewayed into this newsgroup.

 Participation will not be limited to current ALU members.
