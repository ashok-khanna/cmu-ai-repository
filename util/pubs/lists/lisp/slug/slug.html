Darwin, a Symbolics 3600 (S/N 102), was brought to life December 28, 1982
(As I recall, it and S/N 101 were delivered during the year-end break.)
The machine is in daily use by one of our staff (who has used it for years).

As with George Washington's ax, most of its pieces have been replaced over
the years (it got an IFU so all its processor cards were changed
and its I/O was upgraded so the I/O and I/O paddle cards were changed)
but:

512K Memory (P/N 170002, Serial 117) in LBus slot 01:
    Octal Base address: 2000000
    Manufactured on 12/13/82 as rev 1, functions as rev 1, ECO level 0.


The original quote (dated 12/7/81, based on price lists of 4/81 and
11/81) was for $57,750 for the basic 3600 (w/ 256K words of main memory,
80mb drive) with another $7,000 for another 80mb drive.  As I recall,
before delivery the amount of memory was upgraded to 512K words (price
list: $9,000) and we got an Owl drive (160mb for $4,400 if replacing the
80mb drive).  The price list also had Pascal ($10K), C ($12.5K), and
Fortran 77 ($12.5K).

Symbolics has had hard times for the past few years but it made a worthy
product a decade ago.  It is interesting that it is still usable.  The
Sun 1 came out about that time.  I don't know of any that are still in use.


I hope that Symbolics can somehow thrive during the next decade.

Interesting stuff, Mabry. I also am amazed at how enduring these platforms
are (mine's a 3650). The '50 is not sooo old, but considering what else came
out in '87 or so, it's a heck of a package, especially considering the great
software.
Although it will probably be quite a long time before this machine is
retired,
I'm looking forward (as an S-Products graphics user) to a porting of the
system
to a unix box (he ducks the barrage of projectiles..:). The relatively
brutish
power now being achieved there can certainly be put to good use in the
graphics
field, and perhaps in other areas traditionally ruled by the Lisp machine,
the
Symbolics Lisp machine in particular(?)
I'd be interested to hear of anyone's thoughts-experiences-insights into this
possible direction. Would it be possible to re-created the XL1200's magic on
a unix workstation? Has anyone heard of any moves toward the porting of the
S-Products (I know it's Nichimen's game now) to the SGI? Should I be feeling
a general ill will towards me for even suggesting this? :)  Scott
p.s. By XL1200, I mean XL1200 and Genera, of course.

No question, the environment is what makes these machines worth continuing to
run. Hats off to the hardware boys who did the original design, though. I wish
all computer hardware was as well engineered. It gets real boring waiting for
file i/o to complete on my 3670, but the alternative makes me cringe. 

I remember people used to complain about getting dumped into some frightening
place called "the cold load stream" - I guess getting dumped to the unix
monitor prompt (which has only a small set of possible actions, most of which
mean booting the machine, none of which will help you figure out why your
there) is more understandable to some.

But, of all the things that may go by the board in my lisp/computer life
someday soon, its the keyboard I'm sure to lose, and miss mightily. I'm a
lousy typist and this one fits my fingers like no other. Plus I like the
arrangement of the "cording" keys (c-m-h-s).

Don't get me wrong, I love my Lispm.  But Unix doesn't crash down to the
monitor prompt nearly as often as Genera dumps you into the cold load
stream.  It's really annoying for me these days, since the cold load
stream is on a different console (I use an X terminal as my normal
console), and I get dumped into it pretty often (whenever X errors
happen (I have one of the best X terminals on the market, and it never
crashes Unix applications, so I'm forced to assume the Lispm is doing
something wrong) -- I finally got tired of it and ADVISEd the X error
function so it always ignores the error).

Yes, I definitely miss that.

Reply-To: Qobi@central.cis.upenn.edu

Come on you guys. Have any of you really tried to use Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM
on a SPARCstation ELC or better (with at least 32 megabytes). I have been
using such for almost a year now, writing tens of thousands of lines of code
and find that the SPARCstation configuration is hands down better than
anything Symbolics ever produced. The SPARCstation configuration is at least
twice as fast as an XL1200 on the average and at least ten or twenty times
faster than a 3640. For some things (like compiling source files using the
development mode compiler and dynamic GC), the SPARCstation configuration is
two orders of magnitude faster than an XL1200 (yes an XL1200). And it costs
one fifth as much. And my ELC is a generation out of date. A SPARCstation-10,
an RS6000, a MIPS R4000 or a DEC Alpha should make an XL1200 seem like a PDP-8.

Ah, the development environment you say makes all the difference. But have you
really tried Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM? I'm not talking about Unix and C++.
I'm talking about CommonLisp. Now don't tell me about hacking networking and
window system internals since Unix provides all of that as a black box and
most research and applications development work is not about doing operating
system development. I find that at least 85% of all the wonderfull features
of Genera that I used on a daily basis are available on my SPARCstation. And
the ones that weren't there when I came along (like m-sh-C) I implemented
myself. (If people are interested, I might be able to convince UPenn to allow
me to release my implementation of m-sh-C for GNUEMacs/ILisp). The remainder
are more than made up for by the blazing speed.

I was one of the first 3600 users. Back in 1982 I purchased two 3600s sight
unseen, one of the first commercial organizations to do so. I didn't touch
another brand of computer for ten years as I had the great fortune of having a
Symbolics to work on everywhere I have been for the past ten years. So with
great trepidation I faced the decision to switch to SPARCstations little over a
year ago. It took me a few months to port several of my most current research
projects totalling a few tens of thousands of line of code. Now in retrospect,
if I was given the opportunity to switch back, even if you gave me a free
XL1200 that was twice as fast, I wouldn't do it. Yes, every now and then I
curse out my Unix machine for doing something in a brain damaged fashion and
wish that the whole world did the right thing like Symbolics. But all I have
to do to get over it is remember how I had to twiddle my thumbs when I typed
<Select> L and my machine paged and GCed for the next few minutes. Really, try
switching, I promise you that you'll never go back. I pity those poor souls
still using 36xx machines.

Symbolics made one fundamental mistake. They ignored performance. They
focussed their energy on making a whole operating system (ignoring all of the
other things like Fortran/Pascal/C/Ada compilers, Joshua, Statice, Concordia,
the S-products) when the real valued added of the their system was the Lisp
development environment. Back in 1982 not only was the 3600 the best Lisp
development environement, it also was the fastest Lisp execution vehicle as
well as the one with the highest performance/price ratio. If they would have
stuck to those three marketing goals: highest Lisp performance, highest
performance/price ratio, and best LISP development environment, the areas of
their unique strength, and did not attempt to reinvent the wheel of file
systems, tape backup systems, network systems, window systems, etc. and
instead leveraged off of other peoples work in those areas, they would probably
still be in business today---and I would probably still proudly be using their
products.

So what is the upshot of all this. I think that the Lisp community faces a
much graver problem: not the demise of Symbolics but the demise of CommonLisp.
I see lots of people around me spending ten times the effort to code something
in C or C++ than it would take in CommonLisp. Yet the community of CommonLisp
users is dwindling because people are not willing to pay the performance hit
(perceived or imagined) of using CommonLisp over C. CommonLisp vendors find it
hard to stay in business due to the small market for their product. While I
used to dread the day I would have to switch from Symbolics to other
platforms, I now really fear the day when there will be no CommonLisp
implementation. What we have to do to prevent that day from happening is
support and encourage the development of really high performance CommonLisp
implementations, not creaping featurism in the design of CommonLisp.

So to quote Christine Lavin, 28 December 1992 is not a time for celebration
but a time for nostalgia of longing for the innocense of days gone by.

    something wrong [...]

I wouldn't be surprised, but I'm not sure it necessarily follows.
It seems likely that the maker of the X terminal tested it with
Unix and did whatever was needed to work around any problems that
occurred.  It seems unlikely that they tested it with Genera.
So isn't it possible that Genera is following the standard but is
exercising a bug that Unix happens not to exercise?

Still, I get dumped into the cold load stream on my X terminal too often too,
apparently because I have too many Symbolics windows with :save-bits set and
the X terminal runs out of memory and Genera doesn't handle it gracefully.

I have used exactly this config -- blech. Try to fix some of the
handshaking problems with a foreign editor to lisp. (I can do this but
the man hours you take trying to fix things up when you have code to
write.) Try to debug optimized code! I like speed, but at what price?
(One can do some amazing speed hacking on the Symbolics if you get into
the non Commonlisp level.) We really *still* need tags. The debugger
can drive you up a wall. Try to debug with several processes talking
to you at once -- all in the same window! (This is better now in some
lisp-emacs interfaces to be fair.)  CLIM streams don't like
interacting with the debugger still. FFI's can do a lot of copying of data
because the representation of data is different in C and tagged lisp
(Allegro or Lucid)/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM is still pretty brittle.

I wish I still could and I don't need your pity, thanks. Speed
sometimes has a blinding effect. Remember that the memory a typical
36xx was ~4X2MW or 8Mbyte. They did run a *lot* better with more memory.

   Symbolics made one fundamental mistake. They ignored performance. They
   focussed their energy on making a whole operating system (ignoring all of the
   other things like Fortran/Pascal/C/Ada compilers, Joshua, Statice, Concordia,
   the S-products) when the real valued added of the their system was the Lisp
   development environment. Back in 1982 not only was the 3600 the best Lisp
   development environement, it also was the fastest Lisp execution vehicle as
   well as the one with the highest performance/price ratio. If they would have
   stuck to those three marketing goals: highest Lisp performance, highest
   performance/price ratio, and best LISP development environment, the areas of
   their unique strength, and did not attempt to reinvent the wheel of file
   systems, tape backup systems, network systems, window systems, etc. and
   instead leveraged off of other peoples work in those areas, they would probably
   still be in business today---and I would probably still proudly be using their

They still are in business.  I think the error was to hope to compete
with RISC and not consult with RISC folk to add tagged features. RISC is a
bit of self fulfilling prophecy - you get performance on what you
empirically use as target code.

   Come on you guys. Have any of you really tried to use Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM
   on a SPARCstation ELC or better (with at least 32 megabytes). I have been
   using such for almost a year now, writing tens of thousands of lines of code
   and find that the SPARCstation configuration is hands down better than
   anything Symbolics ever produced. The SPARCstation configuration is at least
   twice as fast as an XL1200 on the average and at least ten or twenty times
   faster than a 3640. For some things (like compiling source files using the
   development mode compiler and dynamic GC), the SPARCstation configuration is
   two orders of magnitude faster than an XL1200 (yes an XL1200). And it costs
   one fifth as much. And my ELC is a generation out of date. A SPARCstation-10,
   an RS6000, a MIPS R4000 or a DEC Alpha should make an XL1200 seem like a PDP-8.

   Ah, the development environment you say makes all the difference. But have you
   really tried Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM? I'm not talking about Unix and C++.
   I'm talking about CommonLisp. Now don't tell me about hacking networking and
   window system internals since Unix provides all of that as a black box and
   most research and applications development work is not about doing operating
   system development. I find that at least 85% of all the wonderfull features
   of Genera that I used on a daily basis are available on my SPARCstation. And
   the ones that weren't there when I came along (like m-sh-C) I implemented
   myself. (If people are interested, I might be able to convince UPenn to allow
   me to release my implementation of m-sh-C for GNUEMacs/ILisp). The remainder
   are more than made up for by the blazing speed.

I have used exactly this config -- blech. Try to fix some of the
handshaking problems with a foreign editor to lisp. (I can do this but
the man hours you take trying to fix things up when you have code to
write.) Try to debug optimized code! I like speed, but at what price?
(One can do some amazing speed hacking on the Symbolics if you get into
the non Commonlisp level.) We really *still* need tags. The debugger
can drive you up a wall. Try to debug with several processes talking
to you at once -- all in the same window! (This is better now in some
lisp-emacs interfaces to be fair.)  CLIM streams don't like
interacting with the debugger still. FFI's can do a lot of copying of data
because the representation of data is different in C and tagged lisp
(Allegro or Lucid)/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM is still pretty brittle.


   I was one of the first 3600 users. Back in 1982 I purchased two 3600s sight
   unseen, one of the first commercial organizations to do so. I didn't touch
   another brand of computer for ten years as I had the great fortune of having a
   Symbolics to work on everywhere I have been for the past ten years. So with
   great trepidation I faced the decision to switch to SPARCstations little over a
   year ago. It took me a few months to port several of my most current research
   projects totalling a few tens of thousands of line of code. Now in retrospect,
   if I was given the opportunity to switch back, even if you gave me a free
   XL1200 that was twice as fast, I wouldn't do it. Yes, every now and then I
   curse out my Unix machine for doing something in a brain damaged fashion and
   wish that the whole world did the right thing like Symbolics. But all I have
   to do to get over it is remember how I had to twiddle my thumbs when I typed
   <Select> L and my machine paged and GCed for the next few minutes. Really, try

Jeff,

Its not often I reply to mail on SLUG or anything else, (in fact this is
my first attempt to do so) but I am very interested in what you had to
say about the Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM environment. You see I am not a
software programmer as such, but I do use the Symbolics MacI model 3 to
do IC and Board Level electronic designs. I know the Symbolics machine
very well because I was fortunate enough to use it at my previous place
of employment (Analog Devices in Boston).  I also used a DEC 3100 unix
machine for simulations, a Macintosh and IBM PC for documentation and
lab work. When I started my own company the first machine I bought was a
Mac Ivory (and consequently I have access to the macintosh) and the
second machine was an IBM 486/33 PC. We have no UNIX machines. Our company
exists to manufacture electronic test equipment for IC designers to
characterize so called "mixed signal" chips.

My experience is different from yours. I find the Symbolics environment
much "faster" than IBM, Mac or UNIX. The work I do needs documentation,
schematic drawing, Email and some modeling of systems in code. I write
models in LISP. I can sympathize with the Symbolics "worshipers"
because I think I know what they are talking about: its the
"integration" of the whole thing that leverages what we do. UNIX
colleagues of mine talk about integrated tools and how great such and
such a thing is, but I find them hopelessly disjoint.  "Integrated"
seems to mean sharing a common file format and cutting and pasting.

[In the Symbolics environment I can include a simulation result
in a concordia file and when I click on it access the original data. I
can click on a schematic and edit that, I can send a schematic over
Email, in the editor I can initialize some lisp code from the schematic
drawing, I can get the schematic network to "write" a lisp function, and
call that function to simulate it. In the schematic a real editor window
appears to type in notes and similar. All the commands are the same
(meta-. to edit etc)].  

Now I know Windows, for example, says it is integrated. We have Windows
and Windows NT - the code my company writes all runs under windows. We
have hired expert windows programmers. But the reality remains that
these things only asymptotically approach the Symbolics machine
environment. They all fall down because the low level programatic
interfaces differ (my description: - I mean that I can't do what I do on
the LISP machine - put a Word editor in a rectangular region of a
schematic for example - words fail me, but I would hope you programmer
folks know what I mean).

Now, here is why Symbolics will ultimately have to change tactics to
succeed: even though I, as the founder of this company, know that the
Symbolics development environment is the best of all I have seen, and that
LISP is the "natural" language for IC test program development, all out
products will have C++ and not LISP environments. I just do not know how
to deliver a Symbolics, or even a LISP environment, to Joe User. 

So Symbolics stays in the hands of hackers like me who dream in LISP and
do great things but don't buy many machines; and C takes over the rest
of the world, selling very well and becoming the defacto programming
language. It really is a shame.

This is the bottom line: I think you are a guy who should know what I am
talking about. So tell me, that list of products
Lucid/GNUEmacs/ILisp/CLIM, can I really use that to deliver a product
with the Symbolics look/feel/power, or come acceptably close? If it can
then lets stop lamenting the demise of Symbolics and get on with it.
Put me on to the sales folks and I'll get a demo.

Hi everyone,

<< I saw the comments about SPARC vs 36xx and chuckled quietly to myself >>

Some of my building design software was ported off a SPARC1 with 8Mb of RAM
running POPLOG's Common Lisp to a 3630 with 2M words of main memory (courtesy
of Evans & Sutherland UK). No optimisation of code was done for the 3630 (I'm
still a fairly naive user), but the code ran between 4 and 5 times faster in
interpreted form and between 8 and 9 times faster for compiled versions. Much
of the SUN's cpu seemed to be taken up with running the network, whereas the 
3630 is a standalone machine. I'm dubious as to whether the minimal set up of
the 3630 could compete with the glorious-sounding specification of the ELC
mentioned in another post, but I've no complaints regarding speed or ease of
porting to and from Symbolics Common Lisp. The "Game of Life" example in the
programming tutorial booklet gives similar speed comparisons for the two
machine configurations I have access to. 

I agree with other folk who like the development environment on Symbolics, 
but then I haven't seen the Unix set-up mentioned (intense jealousy...).

Regards,

Colin

    Come on you guys....  The remainder [of Lispm capabilities]
    are more than made up for by the blazing speed.

An old debate.  Performance versus functionality, which matters most?

Who cares?  The relevant question is: why can't we have both?  Sometimes
speed matters most, sometimes specific capabilities matter most, and
sometimes they both matter a lot.  Is there any good reason that we
don't have both, together in one platform, already?  I said GOOD reason.

It's a sure thing that no Lispm can come close to a really spiffy RISC
workstation in performance any more.  It's just as clear (to me at least)
that no software environment has yet come close to the quality of Genera
for program development.  I put Lucid/GNU/whatever somewhere near halfway
between Borland on a DOS/Windows PC and a Lispm, with the moderately
large gaps on either side narrowing all the time.  Watch out, or before
long your argument in favor of the price/performance of your RISC machine
may turn against you and you'll end up using C on a 486/66, or something
similar.

I still use a 3650 regularly, and find it to be superior to anything for
certain development activities.  Not for 3D image processing, however!
What I'd like to see is the blending of the best of all possible worlds -
better user friendliness than a Mac, greater multiplicity of software and
hardware add-ons than a PC, even tighter integration, more powerful tools
and more open information access than Genera, and more speed than a RISC
workstation.  There are other things, but you get the picture.

Why should we waste time debating he relative merits (or rather, demerits)
of our various computer platforms?  To quote Scott Warren, "Computers don't
work."  If they did, we might be pretty much out of jobs ourselves.  So,
given that none of our computers are perfect, let's try to promote their
improvement, rather than indulging in divisive, unproductive argumentation.

    ....Symbolics made one fundamental mistake. They ignored performance....

This is silly.  Performance was not ignored, it was recognized as a battle
which Symbolics could not win, and therefore the performance battle against
conventional hardware was conciously avoided.  The mistake was not moving
their software to other, faster, non-proprietary hardware sooner.

    .... If they would have
    stuck to those three marketing goals: highest Lisp performance, highest
    performance/price ratio, and best LISP development environment, the areas of
    their unique strength, and did not attempt to reinvent the wheel of file
    systems, tape backup systems, network systems, window systems, etc. and
    instead leveraged off of other peoples work in those areas, they would probably
    still be in business today---and I would probably still proudly be using their
    products.

Not that it matters much, but I think your history here is a bit out of
sequence.  And if Symbolics is now out of business, it's news to me.  

    So what is the upshot of all this. I think that the Lisp community faces a
    much graver problem: not the demise of Symbolics but the demise of CommonLisp....

Possibly, but I doubt it.  Your crystal ball may be better than mine, but
Lisp's popularity has already outlived that of most of its contemporaries,
and from here it looks to me like the Lisp community is stable or perhaps
growing.  It isn't booming like it did for a brief period, but that's just
as well.  A slow, steady growth is safer and longer lasting.

Subject: smbx keyboards

It's been said several times implicitly in the "May Symbolics thrive..."
conversation, but I want it to be said nice and plainly so that it doesn't 
get lost amidst all the other text, in hopes that Symbolics has the good sense 
to notice and follow up:

 Whatever else Symbolics might have plans to do in the future, it should
 make sure it continues to make and sell good keyboards (or to assure that
 some third party does so).  The Sun needs an equivalent of the
 ADB-box-adapted smbx keyboard now available for the Mac.  And indeed,
 the Mac version needs to be sold independently of Genera for people
 with no intent to buy a Macivory.  I think lots of non-Genera customers 
 would like the overall layout, and certainly as Genera transitions to more
 standard platforms, the keyboard will be the one piece of not-soon-to-obsolete
 hardware that people will truly miss.

I would certainly ask my company to buy a Symbolics-style keyboard for me to use
on my SPARC, just to improve my typing throughput, even though we don't use
Genera here.  It wouldn't hurt if it had a few extra keys off to the edges, too,
so that special compatibility sequences wouldn't be as necessary--but that's not
critical.  Any way you cut it, commodity keyboards are the pits, especially for 
control and meta ...

Subject: Re:  May Symbolics thrive...


It has been over a year now since I actively used the Symbolics for
any serious work, I've been almost completely immersed in Unix, C and
X since then.  Still, I have yet to see anything that can make me forget
the Symbolics.  I have a raft of 3670's (plus one `40 which I fear has
breathed its last - won't boot), and whenever I do sit down to work
on something, it is an immediate rush to discover the modifier keys
where they should be, and an environment that really does help me
get my work done, and an editor that keeps track of things for me, and
a source control system that really knows what changes I made and
a debugger that behaves the way one ought to and...  Well, you all
know the story.  Management here is all relieved that I have acquiesced
to the fact that the Symbolics machines are history and are not to be
used, but when anybody asks my opinion, I still tell them about all
the issues that make Symbolics unbeatable.  If they could just run the
code faster...

Sigh.

Absolutely; it's the best damn keyboard I've ever used. Comfortable,
didn't require a wrist rest, intelligently designed function keys
(oversized for touch-typists). I'd cheerfully pay $200. out of my own
pocket to get one on my mac or sparc right now.

    Yes, I definitely miss that.

Having been forced onto a Sparc, one question and one suggestion about kdbs.

1. "fits my fingers like no other".  I have that experience also.  
WHY is that? I have even measured my Sparc kbd in comparison, sure
that it was "smaller", it sure feels that way ... but it seems to be
within 0.1" of the same overall dimensions as the Symbolics.

2. "chording". I missed that something fierce on the Sparc. However,
the xmodmap command under X/OpenWindows does allow control and meta
[and even delete] to be moved to locations more in tune with Symbolics
finger reflexes. Below I include two files which bolicsize a Sparc kbd
in slightly different ways. xmodmap behavior is pretty delicate, so
local experimentation may be necessary.

-f



1. This makes caps-lock be meta and alt be control, in the proper
places [no hyper and super tho].  This is similar to the Gildea fix
below, but not so radical: it is undoable just by running xmodmap on
it again -- handy if other people are going to be using the same
incarnation of X/OW [also does *not* make control be delete like his
does]

BTW: Unfortunately switchkeys only works under OW2.0 [and X I think]
-- I'm posting it partly in hopes that some X/OW wizard can point out
how to fix it for OW3.0.

Subject: MacIvory questions

I am going to be coming into some money around April.  I am interested in buying
a used or new MacIvory package.  I'd like to hear from anyone who might want to sell
a used machine in good condition.  I'd like someone at Symbolics to send me brochures
and American prices on the current full line.  I've been trying to reach saleman
Lou Finelli at Lou@Riverside.scrc.Symbolics.com for a few months and keep getting bounced messages.

Technical questions for Those Who Know (thank you in advance!):
I work now with a MacIvory model 3, which is quite satisfactory.  How do other models compare?

I assume that the MacIvory itself is the hardware board that fits in my Mac, and that the box
on the side is merely a generic disk drive with a Symbolics label.  How fast is the drive?
Is there any special magic hardware or installed tracks involved?  It's nice at 652 Meg, but
now that Alphatronix has announced a 14ms 1Gigabyte optical drive for $5K, I should be able
to do better this year and much better next year if I can install my own drive.
Is this possible or is there magic involved?

If I hang a color monitor with its own Macintosh driver/memory board off the edge of my Mac desktop,
can I access it with the Symbolics?  Can I do color graphics, or do I have to pretend it's B&W?

The Ivory uses its own RAM, right?  This means I can't beef up the Ivory by stuffing more
RAM in the Mac side?

Does the size of the Mac matter any?  E.g., could I run an Ivory inside a IIsi?
How about clock speed--does the Ivory suck off the Mac's clock, or use its own?


I'd like to second the current complements on the keyboard.  This, the editor, and the
entire environment that allows rapid prototyping are enough to justify the cost of an Ivory.
I suggest Symbolics should try to push the keyboard for the Mac market (maybe with an additional
numeric pad on the right and function keys on top)--if it turns out to combat carpal tunnel
syndrome, could be a big boom.

John, I can't answer all your questions but here is what I know about the Mac I:

    ....  I've been trying to reach salesman
    Lou Finelli at Lou@Riverside.scrc.Symbolics.com for a few months and keep getting bounced messages.

Lou Finelli was the guy who sold me my MacI, but he is no longer at Symbolics. Contact Roberta Ingemi
for sales, she took over from Lou.

    I work now with a MacIvory model 3, which is quite satisfactory.  How do other models compare?

I used a model 2 and find it quite a bit slower than the Model 3 that I now use. I couldn't go back.

    I assume that the MacIvory itself is the hardware board that fits in my Mac, and that the box
    on the side is merely a generic disk drive with a Symbolics label.  How fast is the drive?
    Is there any special magic hardware or installed tracks involved?  It's nice at 652 Meg, but
    now that Alphatronix has announced a 14ms 1Gigabyte optical drive for $5K, I should be able
    to do better this year and much better next year if I can install my own drive.
    Is this possible or is there magic involved?

I built my setup with the minimum of Symbolics stuff. I use a Maxtor 1.2G drive which works just fine. 
I found that the only way to set it up that would work for me was to use the Symbolics disk copying thing
that runs on the Mac side... I set up a partition of exactly equal size and copied another MacI partition. 
My drive is about 12mS I think... seems fine. The drive cost me $1900 shopping around, about 1 yr ago. 
All I got from Symbolics was one MacI mod 3 board.

    If I hang a color monitor with its own Macintosh driver/memory board off the edge of my Mac desktop,
    can I access it with the Symbolics?  Can I do color graphics, or do I have to pretend it's B&W?

I got the Spectrum 8.24 video card driving a 21in super mac B&W display. I find I can fake out the Symbolics
to use the gray scale option, so that the primary colors as args to the graphics::draw-xx functions show as 
gray scale. I turned it off after a week or so, it slowed down the refresh, so now I use 1bit pixels only. 
I hear (I have not tried it) that you can us the 8 colors with my board if you get a color monitor.

    The Ivory uses its own RAM, right?  This means I can't beef up the Ivory by stuffing more
    RAM in the Mac side?

I think you can only use the RAM on the Symbolics model 3 board. I think on the Model 2 you can put Mac bus memory 
(in fact i think you have to put Mac bus memory for a model 2). I used to have a model 2 and used 
National Semiconductor boards and memory. It worked fine. When I bought my own model 2, I was told that the Daystar
memory board would work also (I couldn't get NS board for some reason ..) but it never worked. I sent it back to
Symbolics but they never fixed it. Anyhow, I wrangled a deal to get a Model 3 instead and so I am happy.

    Does the size of the Mac matter any?  E.g., could I run an Ivory inside a IIsi?
    How about clock speed--does the Ivory suck off the Mac's clock, or use its own?

I have a Mac 2Fx with my system. Its fine. I think the MacI has its own clock.  [Once in a blue moon
it will start up really weird. The symbolics mouse will not be seen and not move the arrow on the
screen. I don't know how it gets like this. I have discovered that to fix this problem you plug the mac
mouse into the ADT port (the apple keyboard port - plug in the mouse - no mac keyboard needed) and
restart the system. The mac will access the disk momentarily and apparently at this point recognize
the mouse in the port. Now, quickly unplug the Mac mouse and plug in the Symbolics keyboard and mouse
before the mac system finishes loading the operating system and the symbolics keyboard will be
recognized again. Very strange.]

My MacI and disk have been up and running for over a year now, I have no complaints. Genera is a great system.
I recommend you buy a UPS and a backup system of your own to back up the entire MacI partition and all your
Mac side stuff. I use a LaCie DAT, it works fine (incremental backup is useless - it thinks the MacI system file
is one huge file). Also, to receive things from symbolics you will need to have access to a tape drive or optical
disk reader.

[...]
    I assume that the MacIvory itself is the hardware board that fits in my
    Mac, and that the box on the side is merely a generic disk drive with a
    Symbolics label.  How fast is the drive?  Is there any special magic
    hardware or installed tracks involved?  It's nice at 652 Meg, but now that
    Alphatronix has announced a 14ms 1Gigabyte optical drive for $5K, I should
    be able to do better this year and much better next year if I can install
    my own drive. Is this possible or is there magic involved?

I don't know of any problems.  We bought MacIvory3's (internal board and
Genera) separately from the Quadra700's and 8ms internal drive, and didn't
have to do any special driver configuration for the drive.  As I understand
it, the Ivory goes thru the Mac to do the disk i/o, so as long as you have the
drivers for the Mac to use the disk, the Ivory can as well.

    If I hang a color monitor with its own Macintosh driver/memory board off
    the edge of my Mac desktop, can I access it with the Symbolics?  Can I do
    color graphics, or do I have to pretend it's B&W?

You can definitely do color; I haven't tried multiple screen desktops.  One
issue might be how bit save planes are handled.

    The Ivory uses its own RAM, right?  This means I can't beef up the Ivory
    by stuffing more RAM in the Mac side?

Correct.

    Does the size of the Mac matter any?  E.g., could I run an Ivory inside a
    IIsi?  How about clock speed--does the Ivory suck off the Mac's clock, or
    use its own?

The speed of the Mac matters because the Mac is the Ivory's I/O co-processor,
i.e. the Mac does all the I/O, including drawing on the screen.  In Macs,
drawing in color is significantly slower than drawing on a one-bit screen.  I
don't know if Symbolics has Ivories working in an Mac IIsi --- does the si
even have enough slots for what you want?  Ivory, ethernet, color?

    I'd like to second the current complements on the keyboard.  This, the
    editor, and the entire environment that allows rapid prototyping are
    enough to justify the cost of an Ivory.  I suggest Symbolics should try to
    push the keyboard for the Mac market (maybe with an additional numeric pad
    on the right and function keys on top)--if it turns out to combat carpal
    tunnel syndrome, could be a big boom.

Yes, it's one of the few keyboards designed with Fitt's law in mind for touch
typists (i.e. the further the target (and the less it is used) the larger the
target needs to be for quick accurate hitting, whether keys, menu items, or
whatever).  Placement and size of the rubout key and perimeter keys is nice;
placement and size of the {,\,} keys is not nice for TeX writers.

But if they do as you suggest, they should make it a real ADB keyboard/mouse
for Macs; the interface box hardware seems to be a weak link.  The large keys
can double as function keys (do Mac programs use function keys?), but I agree
they may want to add arrow keys and a numeric keypad for Mac and Windows
programs (assuming they also sell it to the PC market).

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

CarlManning

Subject: question about official definition of SETQ in CLtL2 p. 121
Reply-To: Qobi@central.cis.upenn.edu

SLUG might not be the right forum for this. Could someone please point me to
the correct mailing list.

The question is this: What is supposed to be the value returned by
(SETQ X (VALUES 1 2))?
CLtL2 p. 121 is ambiguous on this. It says ``SETQ returns the last value
assigned, that is, the result of the evaluation of its last argument.''
In this case ``the last value assignned'' is 1 but ``the result of evaluating
the last argument'' is the multiple value 1 2. So should (SETQ X (VALUES 1 2))
return the single value 1 or the multiple value 1 2? I'm not asking what
implementations actually do, I'm asking what the correct interpretation of
CLtL2 is and whether this is made more explicit in the ANSI draft.

    SLUG might not be the right forum for this. Could someone please point me to
    the correct mailing list.

    The question is this: What is supposed to be the value returned by
    (SETQ X (VALUES 1 2))?
    CLtL2 p. 121 is ambiguous on this. It says ``SETQ returns the last value
    assigned, that is, the result of the evaluation of its last argument.''
    In this case ``the last value assignned'' is 1 but ``the result of evaluating
    the last argument'' is the multiple value 1 2. So should (SETQ X (VALUES 1 2))
    return the single value 1 or the multiple value 1 2? I'm not asking what
    implementations actually do, I'm asking what the correct interpretation of
    CLtL2 is and whether this is made more explicit in the ANSI draft.
	    Jeff
The corect interpretation is the one which is indeed made more explicit in the
ANSI draft.  In the draft, the value assigned to each var, and the returned value,
are the primary values of the respective forms.  The primary value is defined to be
the first value if there are one or more values, and nil if there are no values.

I've written a Concordia document as a proposal for a software system.
The document has many records of type FUNCTION which document
functions that didn't exist at the time of the document's creation.

I'm now coding that software system, and updating my document as a
"programmer's guide", trying to make sure that the document and the
software stay in sync.  My problem comes when I try to m-X Update
Arglist.  Even though the function documented by the record now
exists, and both function and record are in the proper (same) package,
I continue to get the message

  <function-name> is not currently defined as a function,
  so no argument list is available

I am able to get around this by the following hassle [assume a
FUNCTION record called MODEL:FOO]:

  1. Rename FUNCTION record MODEL:FOO to MODEL:BAR
  2. Create a new FUNCTION record called MODEL:FOO
  3. Copy all fields of MODEL:BAR to MODEL:FOO
  4. Find all the links to the old record (now MODEL:BAR) and change
     them to point to the new record (MODEL:FOO)
  5. Kill the old record MODEL:BAR

What a pain!  I've got quite a few of these to do, and I would like to
think that there is an easier way to fix this "problem".  Suggestions?

Thanx,
-Dave

Has anybody tried installing the G 8.1.1 ELS Update #1 on a Macivory

I don't seem to be having any luck.  My System folder gets trashed when
I do this.  I was hoping to be able to use System 7.1 for its bug fixes,
not its new capabilities.  Any comments ?

    have any debt"... and now Ch. 11?
    
I suspect that this is the REAL end of the line this time.
They laid off about 40 people yesterday (of the remaining
120 or so).  This round includes all the remaining
old-timers (Howie Shrobe, Kalman Reti, Sheryl Avruch, Doug
Dodds all with 10-year records, the latter two being
essential to getting products out to you).  They retained
technical people needed for two "save the company"
developnmet projects.  But even the people working on those
projects aren't too optimistic about the company being saved
by them, even if the technical goals are met.

As for Chapter 11, I guess that is the intent of the sudden
brutal layoff, although it isn't official yet I guess.

    Yet everytime I turn around, a familiar name shows up with an unfamiliar
    email address (latest was Kent Pitman).
    
Yes.  I hope that happens for more people as well because it
will be a sign that they have gotten employment in these
cliff-hanger times.

I have heard that Symbolics has filed for Chapter 11.

I have been asked by a supervisor to mention that Inference
Corporation is looking for Lisp programmers with a strong background
in C.  Though I am not clear on all of the details, I am sending this
now, in an attempt to reach as many former Symbolics employees as
quickly as I can.

I may be stating this poorly, but basically:

Inference, developer of ART (TM) and ART-IM (TM) is headquartered in
Southern California.

Inference Corporation's Professional Services has several openings for
Lisp programmers fluent in Unix or Windows.  (sigh).  A few years ago,
we were all using Symbolics' machines; today it is increasingly
difficult to find qualified Unix hackers versed in Lisp.

Professional Services is a consulting organization.  We use our tools,
ART, and ART-IM to develop large expert systems for our clients around
the world.  Frequently, our systems are the first introduction to
artificial intelligence, client-server computing, and enterprise wide
computing that our clients have.

I am not clear on this, but it is likely that the job openings are for
locations outside of California.

I encourage former Symbolics employees (or any qualified individual)
to submit a resume to Lew Roth, roth@inference.com.  Our phone number
is (310) 322 0200, though since I am not located at our corporate
headquarters, you cannot reach me there.

Resumes may be mailed to:

	Lew Roth
	Inference Corporation
	550 N. Continental Blvd.
	El Segundo, CA 90245	

And uh, errr, you might mention my name, and if you get hired, win,
win, win!  (for me).

Best wishes,

A few facts about the current state of the company:

Symbolics has not filed for Chapter 11.

We have just suffered another painful layoff, forced on us by the state
of our revenues.  The remaining staff are certainly not delighted with
this turn of events, but neither are we giving up en masse (as some
recent mail seems to have implied).  Certainly we're no longer the grand
and glorious company of the mid-80s, but who is?  Symbolics' technical
staff is a remarkably talented group; we have lost many old-timers, but
we're by no means a bunch of greenhorns.  Most of the crew that
engineered (for example) the XL1200, the NXP1000, CLIM, and the last
several Genera releases are still here.  By no means do I wish to
minimize the contributions that our recently-laid-off friends made, but
the remaining crew includes some of the most seasoned, most productive,
most talented engineers I've ever had the pleasure to work with.

Jan Walker says that unnamed sources don't think the two "save the
company" (not my characterization; maybe not even Jan's) technical
projects can save the company.  First off, I know of more than two
technical projects still being staffed.  Secondly, it should be obvious
to everyone on SLUG that technical projects alone can't save Symbolics:
if technical merit were all that is needed, then we would never have
reached these dire straits.  Companies need money, and Symbolics'
executives are pursuing the funding that we need to be able to fund the
projects that will allow us to break out of the ever-decreasing cycle of
declining product revenues leading to declining product funding that has
bedevilled our core business for at least the last four years.

Don't get me wrong: Symbolics isn't out of the woods yet.  There's even
a chance that we'll never make it out of the woods.  Symbolics'
employees have known that for at least five years, and I imagine most
customers have as well.  However, rumours of our death are exaggerated,
and we don't plan to give up anytime soon.

Needless to say, these are my personal opinions.  The official company
statements were made in a pair of Press Releases; if there's interest,
I'll forward the Press Releases to this list.

	SYMBOLICS EXPECTS DISAPPOINTING SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

CONCORD, Mass. January 8, 1993 -- Symbolics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMBX), today
announced that it expects revenues for its second quarter which ended
December 31, 1992 to be approximately $1.4 million less than the
previous quarter.  The Company also expects to report a significantly
reduced cash balance at quarter end.  As a result, the Company will need
to effect a significant reduction and restructuring of its liabilities.
The company is considering all alternatives to achieve such reduction
and restructuring, and plans to meet shortly with its principal
creditors.

Kenneth J. Tarpey, Symbolics' President and Chief Executive Officer,
stated, "The revenue decline this past quarter is due to several factors
that will have important implications for the second half of our fiscal
year.  There has been a curtailment of our business with certain key
customers, which in prior quarters accounted for nearly 10 percent of
our gross revenue.  Our product business also fell off sharply this past
quarter, with product revenues down 29 percent.  We attribute the
decline in product revenue to increased competitive pressures and the
general economic slowdonw.  As a result of this decline, we are,
inconjunction with reviewing our financial alternatives, implementing
dramatic cost reductions in an attempt to focus on out core strengths."

Symbolics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMBX), headquartered in Concord, Massachusetts,
is a leading provider of symbolic processing technology used in
sophisticated applications, including on-line decision support, expert
systems and scheduling and planning.  The Company provides software and
hardware tools and consulting services to some of the world's largest
corporations, devising application solutions to mission-critical
business problems in the government, telecommunications, manufacturing,
utilities and transportation industries.

	SYMBOLICS ANNOUNCES WORK FORCE REDUCTION

CONCORD, Mass. January 13, 1993 -- Symbolics, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMBX),
following a disappointing 29 percent decline of revenues in the
Company's second quarter ending December 31, 1992, which was previously
reported, announced it will reduce its work force of 110 by 36 percent.
The Company is experiencing liquidity difficulties and needs to obtain
additional financing in the near term to fund its operations.  In
addition to the announced work force reduction, the company continues to
review all of its financial alternatives, including selling the Company,
obtaining additional financing and seeking the protection of federal
bankruptcy laws.

Kenneth J. Tarpey, Symbolics' President and Chief Executive Officer,
stated, "The revenue decline in this past quarter, and the resulting
cash shortage, leaves us with little alternative but to reduce our work
force.  In addition to these reductions, we are continuing to seek ways
to contain costs and restructure the Company and its financing to
increase our liquidity and to fund continuing operations."

    Has anybody tried installing the G 8.1.1 ELS Update #1 on a Macivory
    (IIfx) running System 7.1 ?

I have done exactly this.

    I don't seem to be having any luck.  My System folder gets trashed when
    I do this.  

Could you be more specific about how the folder is trashed?

		I was hoping to be able to use System 7.1 for its bug fixes,
    not its new capabilities.  Any comments ?


    Thanks, Steve

The installation script on the Genera 8.1.1 ELS #1 floppies will install
Genera's fonts in the System file rather than the Fonts folder under
System 7.1.  The floppies which will be released with Genera 8.3 will
install the fonts in the proper place.  (The Release Notes will include
instructions on how to remote the fonts from the System file.)

By the way, I suggest you change FCC: in your mail header to BFCC: so
others don't have their system complain about not finding your file.

With Dialnet,  you can't FTP.  Some sites offer a way to send mail 
with a request for a file and have it automatically sent back as mail.
For the CLIM stuff, I suggest you contact someone at the archive site
and ask them to send stuff to you when you need it.

You can try using the public ftpmail service -- send mail to

   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

The help message follows.

    You sent ftpmail a blank message, perhaps thinking that we would look in the
    Subject: line for your command.  We ignore the Subject: line other than to
    use it as a identifying tag on all the responses we send from each ftpmail
    session.  Since we don't know what you want, we're sending you our 'help'
    file.  Good luck.

                                             are a VMSMAIL user)

    >>> notes:

            -> you should send complaints to the ftpmail-admin address.  our
               postmaster does not handle ftpmail problems and you can save her
               the trouble of forwarding your complaints by just mailing them to
               the right address.  the "ftpmail-request" address is gone; don't
               use it.

            -> the "index" command depends on the "SITE EXEC INDEX" feature of
               some ftp servers.  Gatekeeper.dec.com originated this feature,
               and ftp.uu.net duplicated it (with a format change to the output,
               naturally).  Wuarchive.wustl.edu also has this feature, though
               their index seems to be empty.  The source for an ftpd that
               supports this feature is on Gatekeeper in /pub/DEC/gwtools.

            -> the "Subject:" of your request will be contained in the "Subject:"
               of all of ftpmail's responses to you regarding that request.  You
               can therefore use it to "tag" different requests if you have more
               than one outstanding at any given time.

            -> you must give a "connect" command, default host is
               gatekeeper.dec.com, default user is anonymous, default
               password is your mail address.

            -> binary files will not be compressed unless 'compress' or 'compact'
               command is given; use this if at all possible, it helps a lot.
               note that many files are already compressed.  if you use any of
               the binary-file qualifiers (compress, compact, uuencode, btoa)
               without setting 'binary' first, your session will abort in error.

            -> binary files will always be formatted into printable ASCII
               with "btoa" or "uuencode" (default is "btoa").  if you don't
               use the "binary" command, ftpmail will cheerfully try to mail
               you the binary data, which will absolutely, positively fail.

            -> all retrieved files will be split into chunks and mailed.  the
               size of the chunk is 64000 characters unless you change it with
               the "chunksize" command.  CompuServe users will need to set this
               to 49000.  there is no way to set it higher than 100000, so please
               don't ask.

            -> if you ask for more than 10 files in a session, you will receive
               an error message and your entire request will be rejected.

            -> VMS/DOS/Mac versions of uudecode, atob, compress and compact
               are available, ask your LOCAL wizard about them if you can't
               locate them (but try gatekeeper.dec.com in /archive/pub/VMS
               if you're still using a VMS system.)

            -> several mail unsplitters are hiding on gatekeeper.dec.com in
               /pub/mail/ua/misc/unsplit.  there is one in c, one in perl,

Subject: Image Format Conversion Problems...
From:	Scott_Busse@mindlink.bc.ca (Scott Busse)

When converting an IMAN format image to a TRUEVISION
format (Targa), I'm now getting glitching of certain
colors. This is happening both when using S-Convert
and when using the load/save images (and selecting
"truevision" format).
  I did some analysis, in the form of color gradient
bars in the image, and have found the specifics of
symptoms. By putting 3 horizontal bars on the screen,
one ranging from 1/0/0 (red,1%), then 0/1/0 (green,1%),
and 0/0/1 (blue,1%) to 25% r,g and b respectively, it
is evident that wherever the value is between 3.1% and
5.1% (roughly), the converted to truevision format
image converts these ranges to r,g and/or b to 100%.
  The odd thing is, if I convert them back to IMAN, they
are read into S-PAINT and displayed properly.
  I remembered having done the conversion before (I do it
quite infrequently) without any problems when I was running
Genera 7.2 (S-Combo 4.1), so I reloaded that world and tried
it again, and still the problem showed up. The only other
thing that's different now from then is the additon of the
4th Color Memory board, and the accompanying "chroma color
adaptor". I haven't tried pulling the adaptor (a hassle), but
I did try pulling the CM board, to no avail.
  If anyone has any insights on this problem, I'd sure appre-
ciate hearing about them. Alternatively, if anyone has an
image format converter (other than the standard ones) that
can convert an IMAN file to TARGA, TIFF, GIF (etc.) or any
other format that the film recorder folks (I'm trying to get
the image to a slide) can handle, I'm up for beg borrow or
purchasing it. Maybe someone has a converter that runs on
a pc?
  The system I'm using is a 3650 with chroma paddle (hirez
32 bit color) running Genera 8.1.1 with S-Products 6.2.
  Thanks for any help, and for your time.  Scott

I have a Windows shareware program called "Paint Shop Pro" which can
handle and convert from/to various formats, but not IMAN.  I have had
good luck generating GIF and TIFF files from IMAN images, but no luck
with Targa.  There's a bug in either TIFF or GIF (I forget which) that
is fixible by loading the appropriate file from the MacIvory embedding
sources - if I had time, I would look for it and tell you the pathname,
but I don't remember offhand.  Anyway, I think it's a TIFF bug, and GIF
should work OK by itself.

I use a CAD buffer.  I have had memory problems that affect images in 
a different way, but it sounds like you might have a color map memory
problem, which I think is on the color paddle card.  You might try
swapping the paddle card ("adaptor" as you put it), followed by the
color controller card if you have one.  Good luck.

Subject: MacIvory h/w debug notes


back in the fall I began having really bad probs with my MacIvory. it
got flakier over time--sometimes it wouldn't boot, sometimes it would.
it did better if I shuffled board in their slots, booting almost every
time. eventually it wouldn't boot at all, giving me errors like "no
communications area" and eventually shutting itself down permanently.
so I got a replacement ivory board.

which didn't help. I got various repeats or the same messages. thought
maybe the disk was bad again, so i borrowed another drive, and was
able to get a working ivory partition built. so I thought I'd try the
old ivory board again (maybe the prob was fixed for it too?). Error.
neither ivory board would work again after that.

visited someone else and tried swapping hardware with their stuff.
that only served to show that my new ivory board was ok. just as we
were quitting, I got a new message saying something (I forget what)
about Parameter RAM.

hah! enlightenment occurs! I then got out the old XPRAM init which I
had archived somewhere. it completely zaps Parameter RAM on the Mac
motherboard. ta da! everything is back to normal. this also explains
the bit about why swapping boards would work: it appears that genera/-
ivory stores some info about hardware config in the PRAM, and the
board-swap would cause it to overwrite some of that, rendering things
OK to boot.

i still haven't tried the old ivory cpu (not quite that brave right
now).

but, the info learned is clear: if the ivory starts acting flaky about
booting, do the zap-pram bit right away. of course, if the darn mac
Genera app had told me this at the beginning, I wouldn't have had to
struggle so hard with it. so i'm here to tell you: zap the pram.

actually, that's probably a good idea anyway. do it today!

Subject: S-Frame configurations
From:	Scott_Busse@mindlink.bc.ca (Scott Busse)

Earlier I asked if anyone knew how I could redirect
S-Paint console output to a window on the Dyna-
Geometry screen, so it wouldn't change to the S-Paint
screen configuration every time it had to print some-
thing out. The trick turns out to be a matter of
hacking together a loadable config file that includes
all the necessary windows for both DynaGeometry and
Paint (using Zemacs) and the code that links them
together as a Paint configuration. It works great!
(Details on request...)
  My question:  Can someone tell me the function that
will load a bunch of .config files (S-Frame screen
layout description files) using a script. It's a real
hassle having to do a [set configuration][load from a
file], type in the name, etc. for each of six different
screen configurations. Thanks for any help!  Scott

It's documented... i read about it in the Doc examiner....

The "Compress File" and "Decompress File" commands are compatible with

    I have done exactly this.

	I don't seem to be having any luck.  My System folder gets trashed when
	I do this.  

    Could you be more specific about how the folder is trashed?

After installing the G 8.1.1 ELS Update #1 my system wouldn't boot.
However in the meantime, I went back to System 7.01, installed the
Genera Update and then installed System 7.1.  Everything works fine now.

Subject: Tracing internal functions
Date:	Thu, 21 Jan 1993 19:13:58 -0500
From:	jbarnett@charming.nrtc.northrop.com

Occasionally, when tracing an internal function (defined by FLET or
LABELS), I have a problem.  The trace is installed using the TRACE
feature from the system menu.  The func spec is of the form
    (:INTERNAL outer-fcn integer inner-fcn)
The error msg generated, before any arg printing, is
    The first argument given to the SYS:LDB-INTERNAL instruction, NIL,
    was not a number.
The function that is blowing up is SI:INTERPRETER-TRAMPOLINE
Could the problem be that the passing of the context(lexical) pointer
as an hidden argument sometimes fulls the trace logic?  BTW, I am not
making closures of the internal functions -- I am using them as ordinary
functions that can see variables bound above.

Subject: Send file problems...
From:	Scott_Busse@mindlink.bc.ca (Scott Busse)

I'm using the symbolics terminal program to connect to a
local bbs. Things are ok with the "set wallpaper file" for
capturing incoming messages, but I want to compose my out-
going messages offline and then blast them into the bbs
buffer when I'm connected. I supposed that the "send file"
extended command would allow me to send a disk file, but
when I enter the file pathname and hit return, the line
is immediatly hung up, and I'm put back to the Terminal
Program prompt. Am I using it wrong?
  While I'm on the Terminal subject, is there a way to
do downloads of binary files, using x-modem or some such
protocol? Or am I limited to ascii files only?
  Furthermore, the editor on this bbs handles all the
screen scrolling and line re-drawing, which seems to be
in conflict with the Terminal program's scrollable window.
the consequence is that I'm often left with a cursor in
the middle of a blank screen.
  I guess what I need is for someone to make a few general
suggestions on what terminal simulator is best, or which
one does what. I'm currently using the default (Ambassador)
as my previous attempt to use VT100 didn't seem to improve
things. The bbs does allow terminal emulation of many types
though, BTW.     Thanks, Scott

You just want to yank the kill ring into the remote stream, 
right?  Try "Yank Top of Kill Ring" from the Marking and Yanking 
menu you get with a control-right click.  Mark regions by 
holding down the control key while dragging the left button.
These operations work on Lisp Listeners, too.

Or <Network> Control-Y, which I use all the time, albeit to another Symbolics
across a local network.  But I've noticed that this doesn't always send all
the characters.  Sometimes it sends only part of them on the first try, and
when I <Clear Input> and try again, it sends them all.  I'm pretty sure that
this means that if the remote machine doesn't read the characters as fast as
they're sent, the buffer fills up and any more are lost; when the other end is
a Symbolics, the machine is slow to swap in the appropriate code, but by the
second try it's "primed" and can keep up.

I'm not sure whether this problem would be worse or better when the connection
is through a phone line, which transmits the characters more slowly than a
network.

My only advice is that if you are still in the stage where you need to trace
the functions, move them out of FLET and LABELS and define them at the top
level.  This makes it substantially easier to debug.

I don't think it has, and I've had even worse trouble than you describe
with yanking (long strings anyway) from the kill ring, particularly when
using a dialup.  Aside from the obligatory lossage of portions of the
data, this has also caused my Terminal window to go into an infinite loop
of some kind, pumping out newlines to the screen forever and generally
not responding to any attempt to stop it.  Good luck.

Perhaps you can help bring me up to date on the definition of CASE.  In
my opinion, taking the acronym CASE at face value, Genera itself should
qualify as a CASE, and a very good one.  However, I admit to being very
much in the dark about what is normally considered to be CASE and what
isn't.

To be more specific in answering your question, I would point to the
who-calls database, source level debugging, edit definition and so on as
examples of Genera CASE facilities.

    much in the dark about what is normally considered to be CASE and what
    isn't.

The CASE tools that I have seen at this site are used to do analysis and
design before any coding is done.  Theoretically, if sufficient analysis
and design work is done up front, the coding is just typing.  They
assist in documenting the work before, during, and after the coding is
done and help track which customer requirements are satisfied by which
pieces of code.

I would tend to agree with you that if the acronym CASE (Computer Aided
Software Engineering or Computer Aided Software Environment) is taken at
face value, Genera as a whole is more CASE than the tools which claim to
be CASE.  I just need a tool similar to one of them so that my software
development can comply with the requirements to use such tools.

    To be more specific in answering your question, I would point to the
    who-calls database, source level debugging, edit definition and so on as

        You're welcome.  I have a PC ethernetted to my lispms, and I just use
        PKZIP on it and them grab the file(s) from a lispm and do whatever.
        I even use the laserwriter plugged into my 3650 serial line to print
        encapsulated postscript files generated on the PC, which is very nice
        and also fairly fast.
William, what PC software do you use (in particular) for your net to the
Symbolics? I'm looking to set up such a connection, and could use any tips on
what software is best, and any hardware/setup caveats you can provide. Are
you using TCP, NFS or ?. I'm currently connected to an Amiga using it's one
and only available Ethernet board and TCP/IP software, and although it's
working adequately, I'm fairly fed up with sneaker-netting PC disks from
there to the PC :( Thanks for any tips!  Scott

To what William D.Gooch said, I would add Concordia for
specifications and documentation; the commands for navigating
class hierarchies and listing methods, etc.; defsystem for
declaring architecture, etc.  However, in all cases, although the
tools are good, they lack active participation (e.g., gen'g
defuns and defmethods from documentation specs; having graphical
class/method browsers).  There's improvement to be made.

My understanding of the typical use of CASE, however, doesn't fit
too closely with the Genera tools (it fits, but not closely).  I
wouldn't, however, suggest that Genera adapt too fully to "CASE"
unless that contributes a serious marketing advantage.  "CASE" in
its most close-minded sense seems an unwieldy bureaucratic
imposition coming from MIS depts in business schools.  Because
MIS people primarily use COBOL or low-level languages, they
deprecate coding.  CLOS, CLIM, and other high-level programming
constructs actually fulfill the role of some of the mid-level
CASE components (and thus function both as code and
specification).

One person's opinion.

     Does anyone know of some public domain code to convert BNF or Wirth notation

Here's what the comp.lang.lisp FAQ has about parser generators.

Parser Generators:

   Mark Johnson <mj@cs.brown.edu> has written a LALR parser generator
   for Common Lisp. It is fairly small (about 500 lines of code) and
   can be found in the Lisp Utilities Repository above.

   IPG (Incremental Parser Generator) is available by email from 
   Jan Rekers <rekers@cwi.nl>.  It is an appendix to his thesis. It is
   written in LeLisp, but should be portable to other Lisp dialects.

   Zebu 0.9 is a parser generator for Scheme written by William M. Wells III.
   It lives in the Scheme Repository nexus.yorku.ca and works with
   PC-Scheme from TI and MIT C-Scheme 6.2 (but not with anything after 7.0).

   Zebu 2.2 is a parser generator for Common Lisp by Joachim H. Laubsch
   <laubsch@hplabs.hpl.hp.com>.  It is an extention written in Common
   Lisp of the Scheme version.  This implimentation has been tested in
   Lucid CL, Allegro CL, and MCL 2.0b.

Here's information on the Lisp Utilities repository and Scheme
repository:

   The Lisp Utilities collection is accessible by anonymous ftp
   to any CMU CS machine (e.g., ftp.cs.cmu.edu [128.2.206.173])
   or through AFS in the directory
           /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mkant/Public/Lisp-Utilities/
   If accessing this directory through anonymous ftp, it is 
   important to "cd" to the directory using one atomic operation, as
   some of the superior directories on the path are protected from
   access by an anonymous ftp.

   The Scheme Repository contains a Scheme bibliography, copies of the
   R4RS report and other papers, sample Scheme code for a variety of
   purposes, several utilities, and some implementations. The Scheme code
   includes code for calendar calculations, Earley parser, FORMAT for
   Scheme, a scheme version of the Gabriel benchmarks, Marc Feeley's
   minimal object support for Scheme, a Scheme pretty-printer, a Prolog
   interpreter written in Scheme, a random number generator in Scheme, an
   implementation of SCOOPS, code from Abelson and Sussman's SICP book,
   Aubrey Jaffer's IEEE/R^3.99RS compliance test, and a LALR(1) parser.
   The repository is maintained by Ozan S. Yigit, scheme@nexus.yorku.ca.
   The repository is accessible by anonymous ftp at nexus.yorku.ca
   [130.63.9.66] in the directory pub/scheme/.

For more information you can FTP the entire FAQ file from
ftp.think.com:/public/think/lisp/faq.text.

P.S. Wouldn't this question have been more appropriate for the
COMMON-LISP mailing list than SLUG?  It doesn't seem to be specific to
Symbolics.

    what software is best, and any hardware/setup caveats you can provide. Are

I use FTP Inc.'s PC/TCP package.  It's pretty complete and reasonably
robust, though by no means problem-free.  One nice point is that the
source code is available (at extra charge).  It can only handle one
thing at a time (such as FTP serving), and it really slows things down
under Windows (but at least it works there and allows you to do other
things while it's running).  It has separate programs for TCP-FTP, TFTP,
SMTP, Telnet, Ping, and quite a few others, most of which I never use.

By the way, I can't get Telnet to my Lispm to work - it always says that
permission was denied by the remote host, although I have remote login
enabled.  I don't know why this happens.   I also have periodic trouble
with file transfer when the Lispm is reading files off of the PC, but I
really think this is a hardware problem with my PC ether board.

The PC/TCP package is moderately expensive ($400), but they do provide
reasonable support.  I have recently seen a shareware program which does
similar stuff (actually I know very little about it), and there is also
a public domain package (PC-IP I think) which is similar, that can be
acquired from FTP hosts on the Internet.

	.... in all cases, although the
    tools are good, they lack active participation (e.g., gen'g
    defuns and defmethods from documentation specs; having graphical
    class/method browsers). 

Several years ago, soon after the first incarnation of the Flavor
Examiner (which didn't have any display of inheritance hierarchy), 
I wrote a flavors grapher as an extension.  It allowed the user to
graphically browse inheritance hierarchies, and associated all the
standard FlavEx commands with the nodes via popup menus.

Subsequently, Tom Shepard took the code, added some interactive node
movement and ancillary display capabilities, and implemented a "High
Order Software" graphical development tool.  This allowed the user to
graphically build a program structure (call tree), specify arguments,
etc., in a system that was intended to generate code.  I don't know 
what the fate of this system was or whether it ever actually produced
code, but the formalism that it was made for was intended specifically
for that purpose.

Later Genera releases and substantial changes to the Flavor Examiner
made my code obsolete, although someone out there may have maintained a
working version.  I could resurrect and update the code (I may even have
a copy of Shepard's somewhere) if I were given an adequate incentive.  I
always intended to make a flavors (CLOS) development package out of it,
but other priorities took over.

Of course, the right thing now would be quite different from what it
was then.  I have a newer, better grapher which is readily adaptable for
such purposes, but again I have other priorities which tend to keep me
from pursuing this independently.  However, it strikes me that visual
programming environments are in a sense the ultimate in CASE tools, and
that it would be a lot of fun to work on such a beast.  All I really
need is some funding (hint, hint).

SYMBOLICS ANNOUNCES FILING FOR CHAPTER 11 REORGANIZATION



CONCORD, Mass., January 28, 1993 -- Symbolics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMBX)
announced today that it has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code.  Although progress had been made to financially
restructure Symbolics, Inc., its Board of Directors determined that this
action was necessary to execute a reorganization plan for the Company.
It is the Company's intent to reorganize as quickly as possibly under
the Bankruptcy Code process with the goal of emerging from bankruptcy as
an economically viable company.

Symbolics plans to continue to serve its customers in the United States
and around the world without interruption during the reorganization.
Symbolics' UK subsidiary, Symbolics Ltd., has not filed for bankruptcy
protection and is conducting business as usual.

Kenneth J. Tarpey, Symbolics' President and Chief Executive Officer,
stated, "The Company has been constrained by the legacies of past
business decisions, particularly several long term leases, that have
inhibited us from obtaining the outside investments needed to further
develop our product lines and market position.  Filing for Chapter 11
gives the Company the opportunity to effect the reorganization which we
believe will enable us to remain a vital competitor in expanding
markets."

Symbolics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMBX), headquartered in Concord, Massachusetts,
is a leading provider of object oriented and symbolic processing
technology used in sophisticated applications, including on-line
decision support, expert systems and scheduling and planning.  The
Company provides software and hardware tools and consulting services to
some of the world's largest corporations, devising application solutions
to mission-critical business problems in the government,
telecommunications, manufacturing, utilities and transportation
industries.

Is the LispM remote login service identical with the Telnet service?
If it is, then Barry is right, you should check for a secure subnet
problem.  If they are different, then check to see if the Telnet

	does that say about the "send file" extended command. Never
	has worked?   Scott

    I don't think it has, and I've had even worse trouble than you describe
    with yanking (long strings anyway) from the kill ring, particularly when
    using a dialup.  Aside from the obligatory lossage of portions of the
    data, this has also caused my Terminal window to go into an infinite loop
    of some kind, pumping out newlines to the screen forever and generally
    not responding to any attempt to stop it.  Good luck. 

I don't have anything to offer on the Send File command, but the
"infinite loop" of newlines sounds very much like a bug that is fixed in
Genera 8.3.  For what it's worth, it's not an infinite loop; it'll stop
after printing most-positive-fixnum newlines.  Anyway, Genera 8.3 fixes
that bug.

Subject: Problem with BIT-VECTOR-POSITION
Date:	Wed, 3 Feb 1993 13:48:17 -0500
From:	jbarnett@charming.nrtc.northrop.com

BIT-VECTOR-POSITION fails when (1) the vector contains more than 32 bits,
(2) the :START arg picks a place not in the last word of the vector,
and (3) there is a bit in the last word.  The value returned is the
location MOD 32 of the last bit.

I'm wondering whether there is an "official" patch for this problem and,
if so would someone send it to me.  I have a simple fix but am not
sure if it works when the array has been displaced (can bit vectors can
be displaced arrays?).

Here is a case that fails:
	(SETQ BITS (MAKE-ARRAY 40 :ELEMENT-TYPE 'BITS))
	(SETF (BIT BITS 20) 1 (BIT BITS 33) 1)
	(LOOP WITH I = 0
	      DO (SETQ I (BIT-VECTOR-POSITION 1 BITS :START I))
	      WHILE I
	      DO (PRINT I)
	         (INCF I))

This code goes into an infinite loop printing alternating 20's and 1's

PS. Customer reports, unless your mailer has been fixed recently,
you should reply to me at JBARNETT@NRTC.NORTHROP.COM insteasd of
what you see in the from header field.

There is a FAQ there, and it is posted once a month. It contains answers to most
of your questions. The following are instructions on obtaining it between
postings: 

   To obtain the files from CMU, connect by anonymous ftp to any CMU CS
   machine (e.g., ftp.cs.cmu.edu [128.2.206.173]), using username
   "anonymous" and password "name@host". The files lisp-faq-1.text,
   lisp-faq-2.text, lisp-faq-3.text, lisp-faq-4.text, lisp-faq-5.text
   and lisp-faq-6.text are located in the directory
       /afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mkant/Public/AI/
   [Note: You must cd to this directory in one atomic operation, as
   some of the superior directories on the path are protected from
   access by anonymous ftp.] If your site runs the Andrew File System,
   you can just cp the files directly without bothering with FTP.

   To obtain the files from Thinking Machines, ftp them from ftp.think.com,
   in the directory /public/think/lisp/. The file faq.text contains all the
   parts of the FAQ in one file. In addition, specific versions of the FAQ
   are available as faq-<version>.text.

Are you saying that you don't see the FAQ, or that you can't find the
information in the FAQ?  There is a comp.lang.lisp FAQ, posted
approximately monthly, and a short reminder is posted every week.  You
can FTP it from ftp.think.com:/public/think/lisp/faq.text if it has
already expired at your site (it was last posted about 3 weeks ago,
and its expiration date is not for another 3 weeks, but your site may
override explicit expirations).

Sections [6-1], entitled "Repositories of Lisp Software", and [6-3],
"Publicly Redistributable Lisp Software", seem like they should answer
your question.

Subject: DrawCircle bug

The latest version I have of DrawCircle, in file rel-8-1>dynamic-windows>graphics-generics.lisp,
does not include nor accept a :gray-level flag.

The patch is to copy the code and put a default value in at the top:
(defun draw-circle (center-x center-y radius
		    &rest args
		    &key (inner-radius 0)
		    &allow-other-keys)
  (declare (arglist center-x center-y radius 
	    &key (inner-radius 0) (start-angle 0) (end-angle 2pi)

(GRAY-LEVEL 1) ;Where in the world did this go?!?!?!?!????

		 (alu :draw) (filled t) (pattern nil) (opaque t)
		...etc.

making sure to call draw-ellipse in the graphics: package.

Subject: more software rot

This function ran six months ago.  I am clueless as to why it is breaking now,
under 8.1.  It allocated a window, drew a blob into the window, and then drew
the outline to the blob using the same list of points and the same function
calls, except with :FILLED NIL.  Now the blob gets drawn, but the software
explodes on the second call.  Looks like some weird flavors are getting called,
maybe having to do with running on a MacIvory instead of a 3620?

Code fragment:
   (setq my-window 
	  (tv:make-window
	        'dw:dynamic-window
		:edges-from :mouse      ;INTERACTIVELY SPECIFY WHERE IT GOES.
		:expose-p T 	:save-bits T
		:deexposed-typeout-action :PERMIT    ;:NORMAL :EXPOSE     :error :notify
		    ;Use this magic to get rid of the scrolling elevator-bars.
		:margin-components
		  `((dw:margin-borders)   ;Margin components trashes the label.
		    (dw:margin-label   :margin :bottom
				       :string ,name
				       :character-style (nil :bold nil)))))

  (let ((STREAM my-window))
    ;Draw Blob.
    (graphics:drawing-path (STREAM 	     :filled T  :gray-level *face-grey*)
      (graphics:draw-cubic-spline  my-pointlist     ;POINTLIST MUST INCLUDE THE START AT THE END.
				  :start-relaxation :cyclic  ;:relaxed :anti-cyclic :clamped
				  :stream STREAM
				  :number-of-samples   20   ;Graininess of curve, NOT the number of points.
    ))

    ;Draw Outline.

Hi,

You may want to contact Edwin Bos (bos@nici.kun.nl) for a graph

You may want to change the value of TELNET:*HOST-DEFAULT-TERMINAL-SIMULATORS*.
It's an alist with keywords representing types of operating system as keys and
corresponding terminal-type as values. OTHERWISE can be used as a default key.
TELNET:*NVT-OVERSTRIKE-DEFAULT* allows you to set the default for overstriking.
If you fiddle around with these two variables, you should get to the desired
behavior.

Subject: Email to Symbolics UK ?


Hi folks,

I see plenty of email addresses for Symbolics in the US, is it possible to
reach people at High Wycombe in the UK in the same way ? I accept that I
might need to mail via a mail-hub somewhere in the US.

Best wishes,

Colin

Thanks to everyone for their tips on setting the terminal
defaults. (setf telnet:*nvt-overstrike-default* nil) worked
fine, but for the dialnet connection I'm making, a dial-raw
connection to a local bbs, what works is a login form of
  (setq telnet:*otherwise* :vt100-terminal-simulator).
These little things that I'm asking, and getting answers to,
are going a long way to help my understanding of this
system, btw. If I wasn't so busy, this sure would be a great
hacker's system! Everyone should have one :) Scott

What's the hack for telling the cart tape system the correct length of
your exabyte tapes?  When I try to dump my incremental worlds I need to
use 2 tapes instead of 1.

Thanks.

(SETQ TAPE::*CART-MAX-LENGTH* 2239000000.)

This is for a 120min tape (2.2GB).  Divide appropriately for
shorter tapes.

Does anyone out there have CLOE 4.0 running on a PC like mine? I have a
Gateway 486/33 with 16 meg RAM. I asked Symbolics for a look at CLOE
4.0, (hoping to check out CLIM 2.0 on it when it comes out) I got eval
copy of CLOE 4.0, but can't get to run. (I contacted Software Support -
they have been unable to help except suggest a larger swap file size).

Now, I have STACKER like I am sure many others do, so the swap file is in
a tiny partition on virtual unstacked D drive: not a lot of space to
make it bigger. The biggest I can get is 4.8+Meg Byte, permanent. I am
running windows 3.1, in enhanced mode, started up with "WIN /3" as
suggested in installation guide.

What happens is: following instructions, run CLOE from the
Prog. Man. "run" menu item, CLOE window comes up. Prog Man iconises (I
have "Minimize on Use" enabled). I see another icon appear, for a second
or so, then it goes away and takes CLOE window with it! 

So I make an Icon for CLOE, and click on it, same thing happens.

So, I call an MSDos session up under windows, type CLOE.EXE and error
message:

>> Error: segment creation failed, error code 100

appears. What am I doing wrong? this should be simple to interpret,
right? Anybody out there any suggestions? (Symbolics SS included). 
					Thanks in anticipation ..


PS: Failing this, anyone got CLIM 2.0 on the PC in some other
environment?

To:	slug@ai.sri.com
Date:	Wed, 10 Feb 1993 18:55:34 -0500
X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.3 PL11]

Hello everyone!

After two years, I'm *finally* back on the net.

So naturally I have a question... :-)

I'm logging in via modem to a Unix machine which is on the Internet.
I looked at a few of the e-mail programs (such as ELM) and decided
that Genera would be much better to use. I tried downloading my
incoming mail using Z-modem onto a Mac, copying the file into a MacIvory
FS, parsing the file as Unix format mail, and (drum roll please)...
...it worked!

Now I want to reverse the process. But there are two issues that are not
immediately clear to me and so I wondered if any of you are already doing
something like this and could give me some pointers.

Issue 1:
After I reply to a message in Z-mail and hit <END>, Z-mail wants to talk
to the mailer. But I need to write a file. Anyone know off-hand what I
should patch?

Issue 2:
After I upload the mail to Unix, I need to hand it off to a mailer there.
Anyone?

Thanks.


P.S. There was some interest at LUV '92 in the game of go. Try connecting to
the Internet Go Server (telnet icsib18.icsi.berkeley.edu 6969), it's really
cool!

Subject: re:CLOE 4.0 won't start up ...


In reply to   Martin Mallinson   martin@cmt.dialnet.symbolics.com

       Does anyone out there have CLOE 4.0 running on a PC like mine? I have a
       Gateway 486/33 with 16 meg RAM.

We have CLOE 4.0 running on several 486 machines - Dells, Compaqs, IBMs etc.

       Now, I have STACKER like I am sure many others do...

Perhaps, but this would be the first thing to check. Lots of programs run 
into difficulties
with STACKER and with CLOE the simpler the setup the better. 
Do you have any network software on your machine? Although we have CLOE 
running
with NOVELL and TCP/IP I would recommend disabling anything like this in your 
autoexec files until you get some results and then try adding things back in.
Our rule of thumb is to have a Permanent Swap file the size of the saved 
image. We currently
have systems of 11 - 16 MBs and our Swap files are usually 20MBs. This is not 
a hard and
fast rule but again, if you can get a size appropriate to the CLOE image size 
it will be one less
thing to worry about. We have had systems running with Temporary Swap files 
too but with
less reliability.


I am running windows 3.1, in enhanced mode, started up with "WIN /3" as
suggested in installation guide.

If you have 16MBs of RAM you won't need to do this, Windows will come up in 
enhanced
mode unless you specifically tell it not to.

What happens is: following instructions, run CLOE from the
Prog. Man. "run" menu item, CLOE window comes up. Prog Man iconises (I
have "Minimize on Use" enabled). I see another icon appear, for a second
or so, then it goes away and takes CLOE window with it! 

When CLOE starts the CLOE front end window appears on the screen and then 
puts itself
behind whatever windows are present, an icon should appear called CLOE 
Background 
in the shape of a DOS window icon. Normally it takes a while for the herald 
to appear in the
front end window, 
however if the Background icon disappears nothing will ever happen. I've only 
recently
become involved with the world of PCs but I have never seen such a flakey 
platform. We 
have had problems like yours "cured" by cold-booting the machine, or trying 
several times 
and having things suddenly work on the third or fourth try!!!!!
The best advice I can give is to get your environment as clean as possible - 
no STACKER,
no NETWORK connections, as few TSRs loaded into memory as you can get away 
with.
Then if you succeed start adding them back in.

International Symposium on
Object-Oriented 
Methodologies and Tools


April 22-23, 1993 


Intercontinental Hotel, 
Frankfurt, Germany





























LogOnTechnology Transfer    

7 Theme: Object-oriented technology is 
revolutionising software productivity. By using 
objects to model the real world, many companies 
are making significant savings on software 
development costs. 
Object-oriented technology is more than just a 
way of programming - when it is applied 
throughout the entire software development 
cycle, it promotes visualization of problems and 
better understanding of requirements, and leads 
to clearer and more traceable design, as well as 
more maintainable systems. 
This symposium confirms the LogOn tradition of 
previous high-quality, focused, international 
events, and addresses the following aspects of 
object-oriented technology:

V Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)
V Object-oriented development environments
V In-depth application case studies 

7 Symposium topics: The symposium 
program includes a series of in-depth 
presentations addressing the following topics:

% What OO methods and tools should companies 
  use.
% How to use an OO methodology in practice.
% The OMG standardization effort.
% Real world case studies using an OO approach:
  benefits and problems.
% Steps for integrating object-oriented technology
   into an existing software project.
% How much software reuse is realistically 
  attainable in a company
% What are the benefits of developing reusable 
  software.

All speakers have a unique background in object 
technology and system implementation. Most of 
them have appeared in numerous forums around 
the world, giving speeches and lecturing on 
object-oriented technology.

7 Who should attend: Any executive 
responsible for information strategy and 
planning. Project and technical managers. 
System analyst, system designers and system 
integrators. Programmers, developers, and 
engineers. Consultants.

7 Exhibition: The exhibition at the symposium 
will feature a wide spectrum of OO products, 
services and publishers.

Dr. JAMES RUMBAUGH

The originator of the OMT methodology and 
Lead Author of the Definitive Text,
Object-Oriented Modeling and Design 


presents a 



LogOn Two-day Seminar on

Object-Oriented Modeling 
and Design


Frankfurt, April 26-27, 1993





LogOn Technology Transfer 



Co-sponsored by: IQproducts GmbH * Micram 
Microelectronic GmbH * Prentice Hall 


WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND


More than just a seminar!

Here are some good reasons why if you are 
interested in Object-Oriented Analysis, Modeling 
and Design, you should attend this seminar. 


C Meet the OMT originator

Many seminar instructors on OO methodologies 
teach by interpreting the methods developed by 
others, which they get from reading books. If 
you take this seminar, you get the instructor who 
is the originator of the Object Modeling 
Technique (OMT) - the de-facto object modeling 
and design standard-and who wrote the bestseller 
book Object-Oriented Modeling and Design: 
James Rumbaugh. James Rumbaugh has 
established a worldwide reputation for being the 
leader in the field of Object-Oriented Analysis, 
Modeling and Design.

C Experience unmatched in the industry

James Rumbaugh has several years of experience 
in working on object-oriented methodology and 
tools at General Electric Research and 
Development Center in Schenectady, New York, 
USA. He is a world class instructor with hands-
on experience having successfully developed 
quality products under real constraints of time 
and budget. Which means, Rumbaugh can 
provide you with insights on and experiences in 
using object-oriented analysis and design in real-
life projects.

C Attendees Questions & Answers Sessions

A question and answer session will be held at the 
end of each day for you to ask questions you 
have about the technology and the method. This 
is a unique opportunity to hear James Rumbaugh 
himself share his insights on using the Object 
Modeling Technique with you.  

C See the methodology at work

In addition to the lectures of Dr.Rumbaugh, 
demonstrations of the OMTool*  -which 
supports the Object Modeling Technique  -  will 
be offered by specialists who use the OMT 
methodology and tool every day,  for you to see 
how the methodology works in practice. (* 
Trademark of the General Electric Company) 

C Networking Opportunities

Another advantage for you in participating to a 
LogOn event is in the possibility to establish 
strategical business relationships. A networking 
room will be available throughout this seminar to 
enable you to meet with attendees and OMT 
methodology and tool specialists.


Valuable Bonus Material- Yours FREE!

Attend the seminar and you get:

% a free copy of James Rumbaugh`s bestselling 
book Object-Oriented Modeling and Design 
(published by Prentice Hall, 1991) 

% a free entrance ticket valid to attend the 
industrial exhibition at the LogOn International 
Symposium on Object-Oriented methodologies 
and Tools, on April 22-23, 1993, at the 
Intercontinental Hotel, in Frankfurt, featuring a 
wide range of object-oriented products, services 
and publishers.


Object-Oriented Modeling and Design

Object-oriented development is emerging as the dominant 
software development method of the 1990s. Applying 
object-oriented techniques to analysis and design promise 
you new levels of understanding, precision, repeatability 
and complexity control.

This seminar will be based on Dr. Rumbaugh+s recent 
best-selling bookObject-Oriented Modeling and Design 
published by Prentice Hall. The primary objective of the 
seminar is to teach an object-oriented methodology for 
developing software systems. Attendees will learn how to 
construct object-oriented models of the real world and then 
transform the models into a design of programming 
language and/or database code. Rumbaugh will present 
various object-oriented modeling concepts, a language-
independent graphical notation for expressing these 
concepts, and a corresponding methodology - the Object 
Modeling Technique (OMT)- for applying the concepts to 
problems. The OMT methodology will be illustrated with 
a case study and many brief examples. Object-oriented 
models promote better understanding of requirements, 
cleaner designs, and more maintainable systems. An 
object-oriented approach allows the same concepts and 
notation to be used through the entire software 
development process. The software developer need not 
translate into a new notation at each development stage as 
is required by many traditional methodologies.

Rumbaugh stresses modeling a system from three distinct 
but related views: object model (static structure), dynamic 
model (interactions and control), and functional model 
(computation of values). The object model serves as the 
integrating vehicle for combining the information for 
design and implementation. The early OO literature 
emphasized object-oriented programming but more 
recently there has been an appreciation of the usefulness of 
OO concepts for analysis and design. This seminar will 
emphasize that coding is the last stage in a process of 
development that includes stating a problem, 
understanding its requirements, planning a solution, and 
implementing a program in a particular language. 
However, the approach is not strictly linear; the seamless 
transformation from analysis to design facilitates a life 
cycle involving prototyping and incremental development.

What will You Learn


These are the major things you will learn: 

o Understanding a system by modeling it from 
three different but related views: structural, 
dynamic, functional

o Graphic notation for each of the modeling 
views that can be used throughout the 
development cycle

o Distinguishing what to do during each of the 
three development phases: analysis, design, 
implementation

o The thought process to produce various 
models, illustrated by a case study

o The transformation of the model from analysis 
through design and implementation



Who should attend

This seminar is intended for software engineers, 
system architects, system analyst, and technical 
managers who seek to understand and exploit the 
object-oriented approach to software design and 
development. 

It is also for software engineers who have 
learned to use object-oriented technology for 
programming but would benefit from learning 
how to analyze and design abstractly in object-
oriented terms without resorting to programming 
constructs.

Subject: Directory copying

Sorry if this is a "frequently-asked question".

I need to copy directories containing subdirectories from one known place
in my accessible file system to another.

My current solution consists of popping into Dired on the source directory,
writing a macro that inhales the next file into Zmacs and then writes it
out to the target directory before skipping to the next line, and running
this macro to completion.  Besides being inelegant, this method uses lots
of Zmacs memory (even with a Kill Buffer afterwards), and doesn't handle
subdirectories well.

Suggestions?  Even something that copies directly without inhaling into
Zmacs would be appreciated.

Thanks for your trouble--
   John Myers~~

   I need to copy directories containing subdirectories from one known place
   in my accessible file system to another.

Use the "**" wild-inferiors wildcard to include subdirectories:

Command: Copy File foo:>dir1>dir2>**>*.*.* foo:>dir3>dir4>dir5>**>*.*.*

For directories with lots of files this can take a while to start, since it
enumerates all the file names first.

Anyone have a JPEG image module for Genera's :READ IMAGE FILE
command?

If not, I'll most likely write one (now that I have some time on my
hands after being laid off from Symbolics), but if one already exists
I don't want to duplicate someone else's effort.

Dear Symbolics Customer:

On January 28, 1993 Symbolics announced that it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. 
Although progress had been made to financially restructure the company, our Board of 
Directors determined that this action was necessary to execute a reorganization plan. 
We intend to reorganize as quickly as possible under the Federal Bankruptcy Code 
process and emerge as an economically viable company.

During the reorganization we will continue to serve our customers in the United 
States and around the world without interruption. Symbolics UK subsidiary, Symbolics Ltd., 
has not filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and is conducting business as usual.

The liquidity problems that led us to take this step resulted from our poor 
financial results for the quarter ending December 31, 1992, which saw revenues 
drop 29 percent from the previous quarter. These results forced us to look at 
the fundamentals of our business including its markets and its competitiveness, 
and to formulate a new plan for the company. Symbolics has been long constrained 
by the legacies of past business decisions: long term leases, financing quarter 
to quarter losses, and expenses associated with products that need additional 
investment to meet the changing needs of our customers. Filing for Chapter 11 
gives the company the opportunity to make the changes we believe will bring it 
back as a vital and competitive player in expanding markets.

Our overall goal is to maintain Symbolics as a going concern so it can:

	*Allow our customers to benefit from continued use of our technology,

	*Continue to support our installed software and hardware customers,

	*Provide opportunities for our employees, and 

	*Maximize the recovery for each class of creditor.

We believe that we can maximize opportunities for our employees, our customers
and the recovery for all classes of our creditors if we remain in business with 
a renewed focus on our core markets with software products and services that 
conform to industry standards. The reorganization plan that will be submitted 
to the courts contemplates:

	*Porting Genera to standard platforms,

	*Marketing and supporting our value added products such as Statice and Joshua,

	*Providing hardware and software service to our customers, and

	*Evolving Symbolics into a software and services company.

This plan will allow us to withdraw gradually over the next two years from the 
business of manufacturing, assembling, selling and shipping proprietary computer 
systems, and to migrate our customers to standard platforms without loss of 
performance or functionality. The resulting cash savings can then be directed to 
software development. This is a fundamental change to the companys business model, 
and we believe that the reorganization plan will make these changes possible.

EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE FILING

Over the past two years we have been working with key customers on large projects. 
In recent quarters this business has accounted for nearly 10 percent of our revenues. 
Though we delivered consistently on all the milestones and passed all the acceptance 
tests for performance and reliability, late in December we were notified by one of 
these customers that they have decided to scale back one of our major projects. The 
reasons for the decision were economic. Like many companies, our customers are also 
feeling the pinch imposed by the slow economy and they look for ways to defer expenses 
and push off projects.  Unfortunately, our project was one of those sacrificed for 
the sake of budget tightening.

This decision had an indirect effect on another project that was also important to 
our revenue. During the last six months we have been negotiating with a potential 
business partner regarding funding for a major development project. In late December 
we were informed of their decision not to fund the project, which meant we will 
continue the project without additional investment.

These lost business opportunities came at an unfortunate time. As the quarter came 
to a close, product revenues fell sharply. The U.S. graphics revenue was off as a 
result of competitive pressures and a general slowdown in the graphic arts industry. 
U.S. Genera sales and service revenue followed the same trend and also declined from 
the previous quarter. One of the bright spots in the revenue picture was the UK 
subsidiary, which achieved its best revenue results in many quarters.

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS

The overall decline in revenue during the last quarter left the company with lower 
cash reserves and forced us to reduce our work force. While this was a necessary step, 
it was not sufficient to cover the shortfall. In order to keep the company operational 
so that we can continue to serve our customers and make the changes that we believe 
will lead Symbolics to recovery, we have sought the protection of the bankruptcy 
courts. This was a difficult decision, but we are convinced that it offers the 
best opportunity for the company to focus its resources on its core business, 
invest in its product line and to return the company to the position of 
technological leadership it has always occupied in the industry.

THE FUTURE

As we start the new year, we also enter a new period for Symbolics. My overall 
goal is to maintain the Symbolics tradition of encouraging the evolutionary 
use of our technology by our customers and users.  In the United States, a 
Chapter 11 reorganization is a formal legal process fora company to continue 
operations while it reorganizes its financial affairs. For Symbolics this means 
we can get relief from the legacies of past business decisions that have 
constrained the company, and devote our resources to evolving our product line. 
Near term product plans include the release of Genera 8.3, and the ported 
version of Genera on a 64 bit standard hardware platform.

On behalf of our employees, I appreciate the loyal support you have provided 
us in the past. I ask for your continued support as we reorganize Symbolics 
for the future.

Sincerely yours,



Kenneth J. Tarpey
President & CEO

I have a trivial CLIM application that works exactly as one expects

but produces an error on UX400 (ie, font not found).
Appended to this message is the program listing, the error message,
and sample output from Show X Font Mapping command.  The latter shows
character style to font mappings for SWISS20B, but no corresponding
server font or pixmap.  Any ideas?

You probably need to add the symbolics fonts to you X servers font
path.  You can do this in a couple of ways, but the way I do it is
(in my .xinitrc file)

	 xset fp+ /usr/lib/X11/fonts/genera

    PS	Donald -- Have you already submitted this to Symbolics as a bug fix?

Yes, when we found the problem and I think when 8.1 came out.  I'll send it to them
again. Maybe with at least one other person having the problem, they'll incorporate the
solution this time.

Subject: 3650 Power problem
Cc:	ren@virga.rap.ucar.edu, morse@zephyr.rap.ucar.EDU



Our model 3650 recently died during a 'heat wave' in our computer room.  
Its symptoms are:

	When rear panel switches are on, the red 'pilot light' on
	the rear panel lights.  None of the rear panel  leds light and
	the 'run' lamp on the front keyswitch does not light regardless 
	of the key position.

	None of the designated voltages are present on the rear panel jacks,
	Nor is 120vac available to the two power supply modules (as measured 
	at the terminal strips on the p.s.'s.)  
	It appears that the 'Solid State Relay' just after the line filter is 
	not getting its energizing voltage. I measured about 5kohms across its
 	'coil' terminals.

So is there a thermal fuse or cutout that tripped or blew?  If so,
where can I find it and how to test it.  Is there another problem I should
be looking for?

I do have an unused 3650 that parts could be pulled from if necessary.

Thanks,

That sounds like a possibility.  The thermal sensor is the device that
sticks up from the top center of the backplane.

This did the trick. Our 3650 is now happily booting.

How do I signal an error and end up in a meaningful frame
of the debugger, skipping internal condition stuff like :internal
functions and cli::compatible-restart-trampoline?
For example, (check-number -3)

(defun check-number (number)
  (if (minusp number)
      (conditions:restart-case
	(conditions:error "The number is negative")
	(this
	  ()
	  :report "Leave it")
	(that
	  ()
	  :report "Change sign"
	  (setf number (- number)))
	(abort
	  ()
	  :report "Abort"
	  (return-from check-number nil))))
  number)

gives (detailed backtrace):

etc.


whereas I want the debugger to put me just in the last frame, user::check-number
(or maybe even the next one).  Is there an easy way to do this?

Thanks.

For those that care, here's the answer to my previous

on (declare (dbg:error-reporter)), ya just gotta know.
Now you do.

Subject: Looking for a job.

I impose on a list of this size with some trepidation, and hope you will
forgive the inconvenience.  Many of you are former students of mine, so
a lot of you know who I am and something about my interests and abilities.

Symbolics laid me off in January.  After some soul-searching, I have
decided to try to use the occasion to change course a bit.  I'm
looking for work in the area of natural language applications,
interpreted broadly.  This area (as I see it) includes speech
processing, machine translation and translation assistance, software
to handle weird orthographies, second-language CAI, advanced grammar
and spelling checking in any language, software internationalization,
and applications in linguistic and literary research.

I'm willing to pay for the course change by working in any (programming)
language and operating system, not just Lisp in Genera.  (Yes, I know what
that probably means.  I'm trying to be pragmatic about this.)  

I'd deeply appreciate any leads or suggestions.

Subject: Genera backups to Teac 150

   I've been thinking of hacking Genera to be able to do backups
   to a Teac 150 tape drive on a MacIvory. Has anyone else looked
   at doing something like this? Any tips or pointers before I
   dive in?

The exabyte tape code is a good place to start.

Subject: meta/escape key problem

I work on a symbolics, but quite often use its terminal capabilities to have a
connection to SPARCs. I'd like to be able to use the meta key on my symbolics
"terminal" and have it interpreted as being an ESC on the SPARC. Is this
possible?  Do I have to play around with some sort of keyboard mapping table on
the symbolics or should I change something in the TERMCAP settings on the sun
(I'd rather go for the first mentionned if possible)? Needless to say that I'd
like to have this change affect the keyboard's behaviour only while I use the
terminal application.

Any hints?

I have been hacking up a Concordia to RTF converter so that Concordia
can generate a PC Windows Help file. Its in the early stages but so far
its not too bad. What I need is a hack to write out a graphic from
concordia to BMP format. Does anyone have such a thing, or indeed any
LISP code that say, given an image makes a BMP file?

[It would be nice if someone has extended the images stuff to include
(images::find-image-file-format :bmp) for example - but I guess that's
too much to hope for!]

Any hints gratefully accepted, and of course, if anyone wants the
Concordia to RTF in return you are welcome to it. (But beware - its a
fragile hack right now - I don't have much time to work on it)

Subject: nfs problem(?)  symbolics serving hp unix client
Reply-To: duff@mitre.org

in trying to read files residing on a symbolics file server from an hp
unix workstation, i find that the hp sometimes sees corrupted versions
of the files.  that is, chunks of the file are missing, padded with null
characters, etc.  i noticed the problem when trying to read a longish
file.  other short files had been read ok.  

the results are repeatable.  re-reading the same file consistenly
produces the same erroneous results.  reading the same files from a sun
in the same network environment seems to work fine.

here are some details:

on the unix side:

hp 9000 series model 730
hp-ux 8.07


on the symbolics side:

genera 8.1
nfs server 425.0
ip-tcp 435.2

any help or advice would be appreciated.

I wrote many such extensions while I was working for Symbolics, they're
pretty easy.  While I didn't write one for BMP format, if you can supply
a pointer to the description of the format, it probably wouldn't be too
hard...

(The probably is in there assuming that it is a simple format, not something
like JPEG which uses DCT for compression.  Since it is an IBM PC format 
[right?] it is most likely a simple format.)

Hello,

I recently became the proud parent of a symbolics 3640.
Is there anyone out there who has information they could share with me about
purchasing additional hardware or software for it?
(I'd like to install a modem and hookup a printer)

Thanx
Ed Smith

I've written some short code for graphing the call tree of symbols.  It works like a
recursive :show callers.  I've included the code below.

    Hello,

    I recently became the proud parent of a symbolics 3640.
    Is there anyone out there who has information they could share with me about
    purchasing additional hardware or software for it?
    (I'd like to install a modem and hookup a printer)

    Thanx
    Ed Smith

If you have the current Genera release (8.1.1 for a 3640), you don't need 
any extra software to drive a laser printer or modem, but may be liable for 
a software liscencetransfer fee.  The procedure for configuring the printer 
and spooler and using modems either for dialnet or through the serial pseudonet 
facility are well documented.  Do you have either the hardcopy or online documentation?

Please contact your sales representative:

(Resent w/o fonts for those using non-smbx mail readers.)

I've written some short code for graphing the call tree of symbols.  It works like a
recursive :show callers.  I've included the code below.

For what I know, there may already be one of these floating around.

;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Syntax: Common-lisp; Package: USER; Base: 10 -*-
;;;
;;;Functions for seeing the call tree.  call-tree returns list representation of tree.
;;;call-tree-graph graphs the tree using scl:format-graph-from-root.  I think it will
;;;find all the callers that executing :show callers will find.  That is, it will find
;;;where symbols are used as constants, functions, methods, etc but not likely as macros.
;;;Will work with CLOS methods including setf but I don't know if it will work with
;;;Flavors.
;;;
;;;Handles recursion by leaving it out of the graph.
;;;
;;;Copylefted or whatever, you are free to use and copy this for whatever use you see
;;;fit.  If you make money off of it, maybe you could come work for me (I could use a
;;;good salesman) or at least buy stock in my company :-)
;;;
;;;Warning: uses internal Symbolics functions and thus is not portable and may break
;;;after future symbolics releases.

Subject: Call for papers for LUV '93, Cambridge,MA

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR THE 1993 INTERNATIONAL
LISP USERS AND VENDORS CONFERENCE: Cambridge, MA; August 9-13

Traditionally, LUV papers address the practical applications of Lisp.
This year, in addition to these traditional experience papers the 
committee is also seeking papers that focus on Lisp and education. 
Papers may discuss either Lisp education, or the use of Lisp in 
furthering education in other areas. The relationship between Lisp and
software engineering education, or Lisp and computer science education 
are especially appropriate subjects. Application of Lisp to further 
education in other areas are also good candidates.


The material must clearly demonstrate a practical value from the use 
of the Lisp language or Lisp technology; as such, papers need not be
especially innovative nor original, but preference will be given to 
previously  undisseminated reports or experiences. Topics in the area 
of programming  languages and environments are welcome; but untested 
or purely theoretical  ideas without a clear direction towards the 
theme of the conference  would be less suitable.

Authors should submit 7 copies of their papers to the Conference
Organizers: c/o ALU, P.O. Box 294, Malvern, PA 19355. The length of
the written papers should not exceed 10 pages (numbered, font size 10pt
or larger). Accepted papers will appear in the written proceedings, which
will be distributed at the conference. The authors of certain selected
papers will be invited to make a 20-minute verbal presentation at the 
technical talks sessions during the conference. Time constraints will
likely prevent the verbal presentation of all accepted papers. Other
accepted papers will be presented during a poster paper session.

Abstracts must be received by April 30, 1993 (along with papers if ready).
Final papers must be received by June 7, 1993. Each should include a
return postal address and a telephone number; an electronic mail address
should also be included, if available. Authors will be notified of the
acceptance or rejection of their papers by July 5, 1993. Corrections and
alterations to the papers, if any, may be done up until July 19, 1993, 
which is the final date for receipt of a camera-ready copy.

Authors of accepted paper will be required to sign a release for
publication in the conference proceedings. Authors may retain the
copyright themselves if they wish by installing their own copyright
notice in the paper. Previously copyrighted material may still be
published depending on the permission to publish; in this case, the
previous copyright and notice of permission should appear in the paper.

Persons interested in the student competition should contact the
Conference Organizers (address above) for submission requirements and
further details. Both technical papers and descriptions of Lisp
applications are valid entries. Submission and acceptance dates, as
well as acceptable themes, are the same as for other authors.


If you wish to receive a registration brochure please contact the
Conference Organizers via: e-mail at Luv-93-organizer@ai.sri.com ,or
mail at the above address, or by phone at 215-651-2990.

Hi,

This is Jiqian Pan from George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia.
I know your e-mail address from a mail list.  I made an application
for your AI position opening at Arlington, Virginia, in 2/22/93. 
However, I have not yet got any responses from your Personnel Dept.
Do you know this situation?  Thanks.

Sorry about that.

;;; Copies all the source files used by system into the destination-dir and in the
;;; process strips all the fonts from those files.  Will create subdirectories under
;;; destination-dir to mimic the file directory structure under either source-root or the
;;; system's default pathname.  system may be either a system object, a keyword
;;; identifying the system, or a string identifying the system.  destination-dir can be
;;; any pathname (logicals work).  :version is :released by default, but you may use any
;;; version identifier that will work with :load system or other system commands.
;;; :include-components is nil by default. If it is t, then it will also copy the
;;; component systems.  source-root is any pathname and identifies what file directory
;;; structure to duplicate.  By default, it is the system's default directory.
;;;
;;; dos-copy-system renames the files and directories to be no more than 8 characters. It
;;; also creates and writes out a file name mapping file showing the original name and
;;; the new name for each file that it copies.  The mapping file is put in the
;;; source-root directory and is named rename.map.  The renaming algorithm uses at least
;;; two letters from each "word" or the original name plus the whole last word.  It also
;;; strips out the value of *strip-name* from the left hand side of each filename or
;;; directory name.  That is, if *strip-name* is "proact-", then the file
;;; "proact-interface-macros" becomes "inmacros".

CALL FOR PAPERS FOR THE 1993 INTERNATIONAL
LISP USERS AND VENDORS CONFERENCE: Cambridge, MA; August 9-13


Traditionally, LUV papers address the practical applications of Lisp.
This year, in addition to these traditional experience papers the 
committee is also seeking papers that focus on Lisp and education. 
Papers may discuss either Lisp education, or the use of Lisp in 
furthering education in other areas. The relationship between Lisp and
software engineering education, or Lisp and computer science education 
are especially appropriate subjects. Application of Lisp to further 
education in other areas are also good candidates.


The material must clearly demonstrate a practical value from the use 
of the Lisp language or Lisp technology; as such, papers need not be
especially innovative nor original, but preference will be given to 
previously  undisseminated reports or experiences. Topics in the area 
of programming  languages and environments are welcome; but untested 
or purely theoretical  ideas without a clear direction towards the 
theme of the conference  would be less suitable.

Authors should submit 7 copies of their papers to the Conference
Organizers: c/o ALU, P.O. Box 294, Malvern, PA 19355. The length of
the written papers should not exceed 10 pages (numbered, font size 10pt
or larger). Accepted papers will appear in the written proceedings, which
will be distributed at the conference. The authors of certain selected
papers will be invited to make a 20-minute verbal presentation at the 
technical talks sessions during the conference. Time constraints will
likely prevent the verbal presentation of all accepted papers. Other
accepted papers will be presented during a poster paper session.

Abstracts must be received by April 30, 1993 (along with papers if ready).
Final papers must be received by June 7, 1993. Each should include a
return postal address and a telephone number; an electronic mail address
should also be included, if available. Authors will be notified of the
acceptance or rejection of their papers by July 5, 1993. Corrections and
alterations to the papers, if any, may be done up until July 19, 1993, 
which is the final date for receipt of a camera-ready copy.

Authors of accepted paper will be required to sign a release for
publication in the conference proceedings. Authors may retain the
copyright themselves if they wish by installing their own copyright
notice in the paper. Previously copyrighted material may still be
published depending on the permission to publish; in this case, the
previous copyright and notice of permission should appear in the paper.

There will be a seperate track for Student papers. Submission and
acceptance dates, as well as acceptable themes, are the same as for
other authors.  Acepted papers will appear in the written proceedings
(please see above instructions regarding copyright and permission to 
publish requirements).

If you wish to receive a registration brochure please contact the
Conference Organizers via: e-mail at Luv-93-organizer@ai.sri.com ,or
mail at the above address, or by phone at 215-651-2990.

If anyone out there has information on ways of determining the hardware
configuration of a 3640 could they please send me some info right away?
I need to decide on a machine by this friday and I'd like to know what size
hard drive it has... how much memory (though I think I know)... etc..

I need to find out how much disk space there is in megabytes not in words or
megawords.... (or at least a detailed description of how they relate)

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated...

You can get total memory from "Show Herald :Detailed No".  You can get
more specific configuration information (such as whether it has an IFU)
from "Show Configuration".

    I need to find out how much disk space there is in megabytes not in words or
    megawords.... (or at least a detailed description of how they relate)

"Show FEP Directory" starts off with a header showing a summary of each
disk.  The units are FEP blocks, which are about 1Kbytes.

That's "Show Machine Configuration".

1152 bytes, which corresponds to the amount of memory addressable by 8 bits 
(the 36XX has a 4.5 byte word).  People alway wonder where that number comes from.

Dear SLUGgers,

The 3640 that I think I am going to purchase has 2 2mw cards and 2 1 mw cards
in it.  The cards are installed in this manner
      slot 0          slot 1     slot 2     slot 3       slot 4
       2 MW           2 MW       1 MW       I/O card     1MW


When I active the hello.boot program it does this...

it loads all the command files and then
Initializes the hardware tables...

When it gets to the card in slot four it does this
"Card being assigned to slot 6
 card being assigned to slot 5
 card being assigned to slot 29. -- no room in memory space "

What does this mean?
Will it be a problem later?
There is exactly 6 MW of memory so should it be doing this to me?

Aha! Gonzo engineering at its best!
These things were designed when 512KW memory boards were considered
impressive -- Hey, 1W was 4.5 bytes!

They had a number of slots and the foresight  to provide for Virtual
slots. (unless it's just the capability of newer FEP proms to paper over
it?) This allowed for larger memory boards to be used later on.

Each 512K of memory gets assigned to a virtual slot.  In your case, each
physical slot gets assigned to up to 4 virtual slots.

Unfortunately, there is a maximum number of virtual slots, or maximum
physical (ram) address space, which I think is 5Meg.

It doesn't harm anything to leave it as it is.  But you may as well pull
one of the 1MW boards out.  It's not being used, but it is (I assumed)
powered up and `wearing out'.  So pull it and keep it as a spare.

Each 2MW memory card occupies four slots of address space (each slot
being 512K); only one is determined by the slot the car resides in,
the rest have to be assigned dynamically by the FEP from the set of
free slots.  When it gets to the last bank of the second card, it
has run out of free slots, and so that 512K will be inaccessible.

A 3640 is an OBS, and only has half the slot addressibility of an NBS
(e.g. 3620 or 3650).

It was a capability that was added on.  Prior to the V127 FEP you had to
load 2MB.flod to get this capability, I believe.

Check the functions in sys:network;namespace-server.lisp.  I think the
important function you want is neti:print-object-attributes.
Be forewarned that unless some of your other machines are secondary
namespace servers, they will have a very incomplete view of your
namespace.  Also, check the documentation and the code to make sure you
understand the purpose of all the namespace files (objects, changes,
descriptor, and log).

Your best bet might be to try to restore what you have and get any
changes from the other machines.

Good Luck!

Subject: WANTED/FORSALE: Symbolics

I am a student at Cal Poly Pomona and just purchased a Symbolics 3640.
I wanted a LISP computer for a joint research project on neural nets,
but unfortunately the 3640 is a 20 amp machine.

Question #1: I understand that the 3640 can be modified with a "simple
converter" for home use (ie: 15 amps).  Is this true, and what are the
ramifications?

Question #2: Does anyone know how much it would cost to upgrade it to
a more compact machine, perhaps an Ivory based Symbolics, MacIvory board,
or UX400/UX1200 board?  (I believe my Symbolics has 2.5MW memory, a color
video board, and a card-cage full of other boards as well.)

Question #3: If I keep the 3640, I will need to purchase a monitor,
keyboard, and mouse for it.  (Mine came sans-I/O.)  Any suggestions or
sellers?

Question #4: Can the 3640 output X Windows using Genera 8?  Can any Symbolics?

Question #5: What type of tape units and hard drives does the 3640 use?
(ie: SCSI, ...)

Question #6: Is there a FAQ sheet I can pick up anywhere?

In short, I am a new, emerging Symbolics user and could use any information
available.

Thank you in advance for any help...
Chris Russell.

    Question #2: Does anyone know how much it would cost to upgrade it to
    a more compact machine, perhaps an Ivory based Symbolics, MacIvory board,
    or UX400/UX1200 board?  (I believe my Symbolics has 2.5MW memory, a color
    video board, and a card-cage full of other boards as well.)

None of the hardware in a 36xx can be used by an Ivory-based machine, so
it would be a complete system replacement.  Back when they first
introduced the Ivory machines Symbolics had attractive trade-in deals,
but I doubt that they're offering much these days.  And the upgrades
were only really attractive if you were on maintenance, since you made
up the cost of the upgrade by the reduction in maintenance fees.

    Question #4: Can the 3640 output X Windows using Genera 8?  Can any Symbolics?

Genera 8.1 includes TCP/IP, X, and NFS, although they're not loaded into
the world by default.  The X software is somewhat buggy, but usable.

    Question #5: What type of tape units and hard drives does the 3640 use?
    (ie: SCSI, ...)

36xx machines don't have any standard interfaces (except for the
RS-232).  The proprietary cartridge tape interface is built into the I/O
paddle, and a reel-to-reel tape interface is a purchasable L-bus board.

Subject: How to map unit/surface/cyl/sect to FEP-File?
Reply-To: beschta@zfe.siemens.de

The subject says it all. Some time ago I read a message on SLUG on how
to map from unit/surface/cyl/sect numbers supplied by e.g. an
irrecoverable disk search error to the corresponding FEP file.
Unfortunatly I didn't save it.

Has anybody these three lines of code at hand (or in mind)?

Thanks,
 Toni Beschta

   The functions are SI:DPN-FROM-ADDRESS, which gives you the DPN from
   the unit, cylinder, head, and sector numbers (remember that the FEP
   gives these to you in octal!) and SI:GET-FILE-CONTAINING, which gives
   you the file containing a DPN.  If the error is in a LMFS partition,
   be very careful not to splice out the bad block, lest complete mayhem
   result.

   --David Gadbois

Thanks for the hint! And here are the three lines of code that
I had in mind (but were partially garbage colleced by time :-)

  (si:fix-fep-file
    (car (si:get-file-containing
	   (si:dpn-from-address #o<unit> #o<cyl> #o
<!-- Mirrored from www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/util/pubs/lists/lisp/slug/slug.93 by HTTrack Website Copier/3.x [XR&CO'2014], Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:41:00 GMT -->
<head> #o<sect>))))

Ok, now I know that there is a problem in my Genera 8.1 world load
file. I.e. the last two full GCs resulted in an irrecoverable disk
search error at exactly the same address.

But unfortunately si:fix-fep-file doesn't find any bad blocks in this
file! And I ran it more than once (even between above GCs because
at this time I mapped si:fix-fep-file over all active FEP files).

My next question is (more or less) straight forward:
How can I replace a certain block with a copy of it without having
si:fix-fep-file to find it?

Or is there another workaround/fix?

Again thanks in advance,

    Ok, now I know that there is a problem in my Genera 8.1 world load
    file. I.e. the last two full GCs resulted in an irrecoverable disk
    search error at exactly the same address.

I used to get disk search errors during dynamic GC's (I never did full
GC's) alot before I replaced my 3640 with a 3650, but diagnostics would
never find a problem with the block.  I suspect there's something about
the way GC accesses the disk that tends to exacerbate minor problems
that the diagnostics don't notice.

    But unfortunately si:fix-fep-file doesn't find any bad blocks in this
    file! And I ran it more than once (even between above GCs because
    at this time I mapped si:fix-fep-file over all active FEP files).

    My next question is (more or less) straight forward:
    How can I replace a certain block with a copy of it without having
    si:fix-fep-file to find it?

I think this should do what you need:

(defun replace-fep-block (unit cylinder head sector)
  (si:with-bad-block-structures (od da de)
    (let ((dpn (si:dpn-from-address unit cylinder head sector))
	  (bad-block-info (make-instance 'si:bad-block-tester
					 :original-data od
					 :disk-array da
					 :disk-event de)))
      (si:handle-bad-block bad-block-info dpn))))

This is just the function SI:ZAP-FEP-BLOCK with the :READ-ONLY T option
removed from the call to SI:HANDLE-BAD-BLOCK.  This change will allow it
to offer the "Copy" option, which is what you want.

I guess I will never want to replace-fep-block or si:fix-fep-file, I
just hack LISP to simulate circuits and stuff ... but this is SO COOL.
Is it only me that thinks this is hot shit or what? You know why
Symbolics when chapter 11 IMHO? Because this stuff is so seductive you
can diddle the bits on the disk and I can model nth order sigma delta
convertors and digital filters and so on and we forget to lift our head
up and tell the world about it. I dont need a product! I'm having so
much fun hacking I dont want to stop. I'm hooked! Perhaps somebody
somewhere should be shot for not marketing this thing properly. I think
we users of LISP and SMBX need to slow down and drop a few crumbs of
what we may know to be pale shadows of the "real" thing so that the mass
market can follow.  Mini-Genera on a PC for example. We will know it
sucks - they wont. We blased a trail into the woods with a blade so
sharp that we got caught up in the act of cutting down the trees: turn
around - there's no one behind. It's probably too late now, sad isnt it?

Well, end of monolog - good luck in keeping the 3600's alive guys - no
doubt I'll need your help and advice when my Mac I inevitably pegs out.
For now I am looking at Allegro CL/PC with horror.

	Is it only me that thinks this is hot shit or what? 

    That example (replace-fep-block) isn't even close to the "hot shit" I've
    done with this machine!  I once spent an afternoon manually calling
    SI:DISK-READ, displaying the disk array as a string, figuring out what
    FEP file it belonged to, manually constructing a new directory file (a
    disk error had screwed up the FEP root directory) -- basically, I was
    doing the kind of stuff Norton Utilities does.

    For a good time, try (SI:PRINT-FEP-FILESYSTEM 0).

    I lose nearly all my wizardly powers when I'm forced to deal with an OS
    for which I don't have sources.  Luckily we have a SunOS source
    license (but I wish there were a SunOS Meta-dot).

My favorite "you can't do that with Unix" was patching the VM page-fault
handler on my running machine, realizing I made a mistake when I landed
in the FEP (ROM debugger, to non LispMites), and just unpatching it and
continuing!

Even with a source license I'm not sure I could do that on SunOS.

Ah, war stories... what a way to "utilize" net bandwidth on April 1st!

My favorite 2 stories don't have to do with having source though...

I rebuilt the FEP filesystem on a running system (with only one disk).
That required having the machine's current world being where paging space
was going to be and the new world being put into an area where I wasn't
using the disk.  (I guess I'm not as much a techie as Barmar... both of us
had bashed FEP directories -- I built a new one on the fly and he rebuilt
his from the info on the disk.)

The other story is also very much doable on a lispm but not on other
systems.  I've forgotten just what was going on but I was patching a very
low level I/O function and had a typo.  The result was each time I typed
a character (on the keyboard or over a telnet session) I hit an unbound
variable error.  Even such things as ABORT and RESUME were affected.
However I did have the mouse and dynamic windows.  I'll leave it as an
exercise for the reader, but I was able to rebind the variable (to NIL)
with just that capability and so was able to use my buggy I/O function and
to go on with my session.  Try that on any other system in the universe!

(Ok, so without source I wouldn't have been in the position to do story 2.)

I guess computers are becoming commodities where most users don't know how
to fix them and call in experts who just pull out an old part and install a
new one (ie, software "upgrades," aka "Fix 2 bugs, create 3 more obscure
bugs and get paid for it").  I still like to put mine up on cinder blocks
and figure out how to get it to do just what *I* want it to do rather than
what someone else thought the average person wants.

Dennis Doughty just attended the Solaris Developers Conference.  There
he heard about some of the great new innovations, including
light-weight processes (basically like Genera processes, multiple
control threads in the same address space).  They also have "threads"
(like Genera stack-groups).  They explained how you could use them to
implement co-routining.  Wow!  They explained how you could implement
network servers that would spin off a new LWP to handle each incoming
connection.  Double wow!  Before you know it, they'll have a process
that tracks the mouse and updates state variables in a pointer object.

Dennis felt compelled to turn to the guy next to him and explain that
he was writing cooperative multi-process applications 10 years ago...

Subject: Chasing bad blocks (final message)
Reply-To: beschta@zfe.siemens.de

First of all I want to thank all of you who responded to my query.
I got all desired information and that's not what can be usually
expected when posting a query to a mailing list.

The :force-write-test keyword of si:fix-fep-block (of course
I can be blamed for not thoroghly browsing the documentation) did a
good job. And if that doesn't help Barmar's replace-fep-block will.

The increased reliability enables me to refocus on (or to? I always
have trouble with English phraseology.) my real work (not modelling
nth order sigma delta convertors and digital filters, but not worse).

That the message has been sent on April 1st was definitely an accident
and not a joke. And I'm a little bit surprised what emotional
followups it has triggered. It looks like that it revived the LispM
vs. rest-of-the-hardware-world  discussion. Hmm, maybe it's time to
start a FSF (frequently sent flames) or a LispM-tales list (if they
don't already exist). The latter should be started as long as the
wizards are around and *havn't* lost all their wizardly powers
(using Barmar's words). And I'm shure that this would be interesting
stuff to read not only for CS students!

Anyway, have fun hacking!

Me too. I love our Symbolics machines. We even have a fully
functional 3600.

The problem is, nobody knows these machines. I am reading about
OOP operating systems. Nobody mentions lispmachines. I am reading
about window systems. Again nobody mentions lispmachines. I am
reading the LISP FAQ. Where is the question "What is a Lispmachine?"
answered (or asked ?) ?

In a little hobby mailbox network in Germany we currently have
a discussion about these things. Most of the people thought
you can't do any low-level programming in LISP. Some of them
will now learn LISP. You have to tell the people!

Well I don't know. Even Wirth is coming with new little systems
(Oberon). Why don't we have a lisp equivalent to Oberon (but better).
A tiny OS with it's own windowing system and usable on PCs at home.

Well, maybe Apple is developing something, I don't know. Their Common
Lisp is quite nice, but again not enough people know about it and
I haven't seen any articles about it in computer magazines for a
long time.

My (and Ralf Moeller's I think) favourite would be a LISP environment
on top of a SGI (with a 64bit R4400) with a 3D graphical interface.
Its a shame, but there were Lispmachines with SGI-boards along time
ago! Now they are gone.

On one hand, I don't know anything about Oberon (sounds like I should).
On the other hand, I'm now learning, and rather infatuated with, ``ML'', so 
theres the burning question "Can a system as cool as Genera/LispM be built 
in that?" Isn't the concept/envrionment of the LispM what we all *really* 
love?  Could be happiness be found in an environment like that in another
language (sort of like moving to another country?)? Excuse the blasphemy, 
if any is perceived.  (Uh, oh, I'm digressing again...) 

Don't get me wrong, I really like hacking in lisp, but I'm beginning to
suspect the the Coolness of Genera has more to do with design and thought,
and that Lisp (wonderful as it is) acts more as an 'enabling technonlogy'
[i.e. it was done in lisp 'cuz lisp lets you do it].  The historians
will correct me here, I'm sure.

> A tiny OS with it's own windowing system and usable on PCs at home.

I've dreamed of something like this, and even given a little thought
to trying to do it [using, say, Mach3 and CMU Common Lisp as a starting
point... but I guess that isn't really "tiny" anymore]  Sadly, it's well 
beyond my abilities and time resources. Of course, I'm a bit of a dreamer 
anyhow...(aren't we all?) 

For the time being, I took the easy way out, and got a 3640 to play with.
[which has the nice benefit of stalling off the need to buy a PC :-)].

A while back, someone [who?] mentioned that Genera may be ported to the
Alpha...  If this happens, and if DEC comes through with an affordable 
Alpha-PC, this may be the "break" we're all looking for...

    Gresham's Law applies at least as much to systems as to currency.

An interesting hypothesis. To paraphrase: "When two systems are equal
in terms of problem-solving value but not intrinsic value, the one 
with greater intrinsic value tends to be hoarded."

Are we all guilty of hoarding technology?

Symbolics is working trying to resolve this problem, but they don't know
what is causing it.  We have replaced the drive and changed from video

I have experienced the problem on both XL1201's and 36xx's.  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

   I know this is the wrong place, but I trashed Barmar's pointer to the right mailing
   list when he replied to another of my inappropriately mailed general lisp questions.

Thanks,
Guy.

Cc:	jnc@ginger.lcs.mit.edu

Anyone out there have a set of (reasonably recent, but not necessarily the
latest release) Symbolics manuals they don't want? I'll even pay for the
privilege! I want a set for my library, and don't feel like forking up ~$500
for a brand spanking new set (i.e. including the programmer's set). I'd prefer
the paperbound kind to the old ones in binders (less space-consuming).

Please reply directly to me, as I'm not on the mailing list (and only to me,
as I'm sure nobody else cares to hear about your spare set).

	Noel

we are trying to find the best lisp system that runs on sun machines.

(we are coming from the point of view of someone who loves lisp
machines (symbolics) (and has been using them almost every day
for the last 6 years).

CLIM is very important to us as well.


Any recommendations and insights would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: Sick Symbolics monitor

I have a sick Symbolics monitor, model 3670.  When I turn it on, I get
a little noise on the speaker and the LEDs inside the monitor read "FF0".  
I don't get anything on the monitor.

Does anyone know how to read these LEDs?

They're only useful when you put the monitor into diagnostic mode (there's
a toggle switch on the controller board); they can be used to debug the
firmware.  This is not something anyone should need to do these days.

I'm going from memory, but I think FF0 is a normal value.  Your problem is
probably the high-voltage power supply (it powers the tube, but not the
electronics) or the tube itself.  In either case, there's not much you can
do but replace the failing component.

I have an old-style monitor that almost never lights the first time I
power it up. I have to flip the power switch off then on quickly,
followed by a Local-B for a couple of seconds. I have to repeat those
steps several times before the monitor lights. After that, the monitor
is fine until the next power outage, which is rather frequent since my
machine is powered by a rural electrical coop.

So there's no confusion, hold down the local key, then press the b key
for a few seconds. This is how you brighten the screen. Local-D dims it.

    ....
    A tiny OS with it's own windowing system and usable on PCs at home....

I have recently gotten into something that looks very promising, and I
want to share it with you all.  I know I'll probably be labelled a
heretic and shot for even mentioning this on the mailing list, but...
has anybody else played around with VisualWorks/SmallTalk yet?  I have
done a prototype with it for a proposal, and hope to be doing more very
soon.

VisualWorks is a software product of ParcPlace Systems, a PARC spinoff.
It has a lot of the flavor of most interface builders, but with
additional hooks into SmallTalk code development (in other words, it
lives in a much more tightly integrated environment than most).  So far,
I have found it to be considerably more productive than anything other
than Genera, plus it runs on everything from Unix workstations to PCs.
Code is generally 100% portable across platforms, and user interface
look-and-feel is retained, within the limits of pixel and screen sizes,
etc.  Source code is distributed as a matter of course - we even got the
sources along with our one-month evaluation copy.

This is certainly no Genera, but that in itself has some advantages.
One is size - running the development system on a 486 PC is no problem
(the more RAM the better, of course).  They also have a package which
lets you remove unwanted stuff from completed applications to reduce the
image size.

My main complaint about it so far, aside from all the nice Genera stuff
that isn't there, is that the SmallTalk doesn't do multiple superclassing.
Many SmallTalkers view this as some sort of advantage, but some of them
will at least admit that they feel that way only because they've never
seen "multiple superclassing done right" as it is in CLOS and flavors, 
and that multiple superclassing done wrong can be hazardous (so they say,
and I have no reason to doubt that it's so).

Anyway, if you have a chance, give it a look.  It is good enough that
for the first time in over 10 years, I no longer feel uncomfortable
without the use of my Lispm.

  The Spring Project
  Jim Mitchell
  Sun Labs

        Abstract:

        The Spring Project is a strategic investigation and
        development of technology for providing distributed,
        securable objects that are usable both by high level
        applications and for building the operating system
        itself.  The Spring prototype OS is structured as an
        object-oriented microkernel with almost all of the OS
        functionality built as non-kernel object managers
        providing objects rather than procedural interfaces.
        This talk will discuss in depth the mechanisms that
        Spring provides and how they are used to build
        traditional OS functionality such as threads, virtual
        memory, file systems, etc. as well as more novel
        features such as distributed naming services for
        objects and automated testing of components based on
        formal semantics.

A few newbie questions:

  Where are the good inexpensive parts sources for the 3640 and 3670 series?

  What's the market rate for a used MacIvory 3 board?

  Are there any general Symbolics utilities in ftp-able archives?
     (I'm aware of the comp.lang.lisp faq - I'm looking for system-
      specific PD utilities, not AI implementations)

  Finally, is it possible to upgrade from the L-series to the G-series
     (3640 or 3670 --> 3650) by doing a board swap, or is it hairier 
     than that?

    A few newbie questions:

      Where are the good inexpensive parts sources for the 3640 and 3670 series?

There's a company called Great Eastern Technology that provides (or used
to provide) third-party hardware support for Symbolics machines.  They
also sell used parts.  They also have some parts they designed themselves
(L-bus memory boards that accept standard SIMM memory).

      Are there any general Symbolics utilities in ftp-able archives?
	 (I'm aware of the comp.lang.lisp faq - I'm looking for system-
	  specific PD utilities, not AI implementations)

There's a SLUG library, but I don't think it's FTPable; we used to sell
tapes for around $35.  One of the reasons it's not FTPable is that much
of the code in it is modified Symbolics code, so we had to restrict
distribution to sites with Symbolics licenses.

      Finally, is it possible to upgrade from the L-series to the G-series
	 (3640 or 3670 --> 3650) by doing a board swap, or is it hairier

No, there are differences in the two series throughout the architecture.
However, if you can get an IFU kit, which converts a 36[47]0 to a
36[47]5, you get a good deal of the performance improvements provided by

       Is there any way I can get copies of the field service manuals
	  (or other hardware manuals) for the aforementioned machines?

We got copies when we took the Customer Service Training class, which
was required for going onto thei Shared Maintenance plan.  The manuals
are marked Symbolics proprietary, so I don't think I can pass them on to
you.  They may be willing to sell copies themselves, though.

You can get a 3640 with either ESDI or SMD controllers.

    I have a couple of quick questions, any answers gratefully received:

Your message got through the first time.  But since I wasn't at the most
recent X3J13 meeting I didn't know detailed answers.  But since no one
else replied, I'll say what I can.

    1. What is the current status of dpANS?  

It's being revised in response to the comments received during the
public review.  I don't know the schedule, as minutes of the meeting
haven't been distributed yet.

    2. Where should I really be asking this question and how do I subscribe to that list? 

Common-lisp@ai.sri.com (I'm cc'ing this there, in the hopes that someone
there will provide a more detailed answer to quesiton 1).  Send mail to
common-lisp-request@ai.sri.com to subscribe.  Or if you have netnews you
can read the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup (they're not equivalent, but both
cover much the same material, and the newsgroup is more active these
days -- the mailing list is virtually unused).

       I know this is the wrong place, but I trashed Barmar's pointer to the right mailing
       list when he replied to another of my inappropriately mailed general lisp questions.

It really shouldn't be that hard to remember the mailing list name.

I am an engineer using LISP for simulations and things - LISP is very
flexible and I enjoy using it. Almost everything I want to do can be
done in LISP.

One thing that is hard to do is (+ 3.45k 4.56k) = 8.01k

You see electrical engineers think of k, u, p n as scaling factors for
numbers (remember those HP calculators that had engineering mode where
the exponent was always a multiple of 3?)

This is not a crazy request. One of the advantages of LISP in a
simulator is that you can build macros and turn LISP itself into the
simulator you need to get the job done. I sit in a LISP listener or
LISP (Emacs) editor and run simulations. Other simulators know about
engineering numbers [all spice variants do, and some simulators even know
about units too - (/ 3.4v 0.1mA) => 34kohms]. 

I can find no way in common lisp to make the reader see 3.4k as a
number. I know about the # macro and escaping to user code in the
reader but its not acceptable to prefix everything with #.

A long time ago someone hacked the symbolics read table stuff for me to
give me an EE syntax (similar to the CL or ZL syntax option on the Smbx
machines) but this only works on the Smbx machine (and that was at my
last place of employment and I no longer have access to that code).

What this mail is about boils down to 2 things:

1) Does anyone know how to get Common Lisp to read engineering numbers?
(and print them - although this is easier)

2) If not, would someone responsible for new feature in CL please
consider some mechanism to allow this.

Could this be a simple as defining a *readhook* like the *evalhook*?
[Can *evalhook* do this job for me?]

Hi,

I think we have exactly the read macros you asked for. My colleague
Roman Cunis developed a measures package that even handles conversions
between different units. I already convinced him to make his code
public. However, the documentation is in German.

Maybe he will translate it if someone would like to have the code.
The code has been tested in Allegro CL, Symbolics CL, Macintosh CL,
and Harlequin CL.

Example:

(in-package :cl-user)

(use-package :measures)

(define-unit |m| :base length :metric)

(define-unit |qm| |m| |m| :base area)
(define-unit |qkm| |km| |km|)
(define-unit |ar| 100 |qm|)
(define-unit |ha| 100 |ar|)

(define-unit |m3| |m| |m| |m| :base volume)
(define-unit |ccm| |cm| |cm| |cm|)
(define-unit |l| 1000 |ccm|)

(define-unit |s| :base time)
(define-unit |min| 60 |s|)
(define-unit |h| 60 |min|)
(define-unit |ms| 0.001 |s|)

(define-unit |m/s| |m| |/s| :base speed)
(define-unit |km/h| |km| |/h|)

(define-unit DM :base currency)
(define-unit |Pfg| 0.01 DM)
(define-unit $ 1.85 DM)
(define-unit |c| 0.01 $)

(define-unit-format time :step |h| |min| |s|)
(define-unit-format speed :unit |km/h|)
(define-unit-format length :base)



Application:

? (dim+ 1m 4cm)
1.04m

? (dim+ 1min 46s 4ms)
1min:46.004s

? (dim+ 3h (dim+ 1min 46s 4ms))
3h:1min:46.004s

Thanks for the feedback ! .. I have FTPMAIL'ed for the infix reader and
I have reached down CLtL2 one more time. I guess I am missing something
- I see how the set-macro-character stuff works and I know about bashing
the readtable and set-syntax-from-character and stuff - but I still don't
see how to make it read my engineering things as numbers.

This I understand: (+ 3.14 #E3.4k) - the #E says escape and read the
next thing with some special code.

This I understand: {3.4k + 9.1k} - the { introduces some funky
environment where I can take control of the reader.

I don't want either of these, I just want 3,4k to be read as 34.0e3, 5.6u
to be read as 5.6e-6, 4p to be read as 4e-12 etc. The complete set is:

T == 1e12
G == 1e9
ME == 1e6
K == 1e3
m == 1e-3
u == 1e-6
n == 1e-9
p == 1e-12
f == 1e-15
a == 1e-18

I can't see the hook into the reader code that allows it to be halfway
down the string "123.45e6" nicely reading the "123.45", hits the "e" and
figures "whoops this must be a floating point number, exponent coming up
next". Notice it doesn't know its an exponential format number 'till it
hits the "e". CLtL2 seems to gives me the ability to say #E3.4k
analogous to #C(1 2). But these are prefixes.

If I (read-from-string "3.4k") a symbol is consed up, if I
(read-from-string "3.4e0") a number is consed up: where is the hook for
me to tell the reader about the "k" being something special that, like
the "e", is just part of the printed representation of a number? - in
this case a factor to be applied to the number...

I'll look at the "infix.lisp" example when I receive it - perhaps I am
making a more of this than necessary due to my misunderstanding.

yes yes, please send the code! I think a lot of other people would be
interested too ... Does anyone know where Ralf should put this for
general use? 

My German is non-existant but I can read LISP! I would be pleased to try
it out.

Prefixes is all Common Lisp gives you.  A general mechanism for
fiddling with the reader would be overkill.

You can still do what you want, perhaps a bit laboriously, by defining
your own reader functions for all tokens starting with a digit or -
(see SET-MACRO-CHARACTER).  You'll have to do some parsing yourself,
but you can get help from the standard reader using READ-FROM-STRING
with the standard readtable on selected parts of your token.

We are going to be a subcontractor on a proposal with another company.  The
prime contractor will be converting our Common-Lisp code to C.  Their pricing
to the client will be based on the number of C lines they expect to "write".

Does anyone have any empirical data on lines of Lisp to lines of C  (yes, I
know it is *extremely* variable -- eg, whether we need a GC)?   Also, does
anyone have any data on the relative cost of those lines compared to lines
of C written from scratch?

I thought that the owners of old dead lispms might be interested in
this.  Maybe you could at least salvage the disk drives for some other
application.

I have 2 OMTI 3527 SCSI adapters for sale.  These make an ST-506 RLL drive
look like a SCSI disk drive.  Each adapter will support two RLL drives.  I
have used this model OMTI adapter with my Amiga A500 and a C-Ltd SCSI host
adapter without problems. I'm selling these because I got them about the
same time I decided to sell instead of expand my Amiga so I have never even
used them.  I can't guarantee they will work with every SCSI host adapter.

They are essentially new in box. I paid $150/ea, make me an offer.

I haven't any code yet Scott. I was asking how to write the code. I

was too good to miss, I am waiting for it to be sent.

Looks like its going to end up in an accessible library someplace -
Vincent Keunen [keunen@montefiore.ulg.ac.be] suggested the
"Lisp Utilities Repository" which I hadn't heard off before now.

My plan is to wait a few days and see if anything else comes up; if not
try to write my own based on a suggestion from Luigi Semenzato
<luigi@paris.cs.berkeley.edu>:

By the way, Chuck Irvine irvine@lks.csi.com asks:

I guess my answer is that I am trying to build a set of tools for
electronic design engineers (we make and sell a bench-top mixed signal
test system - we are a small start up company just getting going) and
they can't understand what the #E is all about. In my previous
incarnation as a design engineer at Analog Devices, I was part of a
small group using LISP to do the same thing. I loved it, as did all the
others in the group. Funny thing happened. To LISP or not to LISP became
a "black and white"/"good guys and bad guys" issue. You either loved or
hated it. The lovers said LISP is SO cool and I know why we need things
like "()" and #E and "'" and those oh-so-wonderful "lambda"'s etc etc.
The basic "mathematical foundation", core concept, just "clicked"
with them. If you never bought the foundation you never used it - it
became a "religious" debate. For this reason my new company offers a C
and C++ interface to our tester: C has been accepted as a necessary evil
by design engineers. They attend courses and learn how to use it because
their managers see "C" and "C++" everywhere (who could loose when you
bet on the side of ATT, Berkeley, SUN and HP they reason).

I am working to get a LISP interface in there because I know its just
plain better than C for these applications. (Interpreter, no data
typing, tremendous math capability, generic post processing functions,
GC etc).  

Things like #E I know would kill it!  I'd be back into selling the
coolness of the underlying substrate rather than giving the guy a tool
that fits naturally into his way of thinking. Cadence have this figured
out - SKILL is LISP of course with a choice of parser. Autocad did this,
and I think Interleaf did too - a gentle introduction to LISP by just
doing the job better.

   There's a company called Great Eastern Technology that provides (or used
   to provide) third-party hardware support for Symbolics machines.  They
   also sell used parts.  They also have some parts they designed themselves
   (L-bus memory boards that accept standard SIMM memory).

For those who are interested, I called Great Eastern yesterday.  $1000
for an unpopulated board that holds up to 40M (8Mw) of SIMMs.  $2000
fully populated.

We are currently looking at interfacing CLOE with non-Lisp
tools. We would be interested in any experiences people have
had with interfacing through DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) or
DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries), or other alternatives. In one
application, the CLOE application will be the client and the
database tools the servers; while in a second application
being developed, the interaction between the CLOE application
and the other window tools has not been decided. In the first
application, the user interface has been implemented in CLIM,
while in our second application this decision has been post-
poned until more information about foreign modules interacting
with CLOE (and/or CLIM) can be obtained.

Anybody with any experience in this area (or useful pointers)?
I know the CLOE 4.0 documentation suggests looking in the
Microsoft Window's Users Guide, however, I can find no mention
of DLLs in our versions, including 3.1.)

Thanks,

ben moreland

The first release of Genera was 7.0.

It is indeed the plural of "genus", but was also intended to suggest
the notion of "generic" as in a "generic function" (rather than the
connotation of "cheap non-name brand").  I don't remember who came up
with the name.  Some didn't like it, some did.

I have no idea who came up with it, but I always figured "Genera" was a
good choice since it is derived from "Genus". This is the old Platonic
view of the world:  there are five "labels" descriptive of everything:
Genus, Species, Property, Difference and Accident. "Genera" and
"Generic" derive from this concept so "generic function" is intimately
tied to "Genera". The tools are independent of the "Species" that
they operate on (see the diagram in the Symbolics Documentation for new
users) - calling the collection of these tools "Genera" is therefore
entirely appropriate!

I dont want to test this out, for obvious reasons... but...

You should be able to get hold of a proper pathname object for the beast
using FS:DIRECTORY-LIST, then use DELETE-FILE get rid of it.

	   What is the origin of the name "Genera?" Is it the simple plural of
	   "genus," or is there more to it? Was "Genera" introduced with 6.0, or
	   was it earlier?

       The first release of Genera was 7.0.

       It is indeed the plural of "genus", but was also intended to suggest
       the notion of "generic" as in a "generic function" (rather than the
       connotation of "cheap non-name brand").  I don't remember who came up
       with the name.  Some didn't like it, some did.

    Didn't we actually buy that name from the same name consultants that
    came up with "Wheels", "Semanticue", "Frame-Up", "Firewall" and the
    rest?

Yup.

I recall suspecting said image consultants didn't quite have a grip on
reality when they confused the (then-new) adaptive hash-table system
with a spreadsheet ("They're tables, right?") and clept them
"PlanMaster."  (I think the hashtables ended up getting called
SmartStore.  Why does there have to be an embedded capital or
punctuation mark?)

There were numerous bad jokes about new names, e.g., 

Zmail                       -> FlameThrower
Tail-Recursion Optimizaiton -> SmartAss

... and so on.  There are more, but it's generally more fun to make them
up.

   Does anyone know an easy way to delete a file that has garbage in its name?
   I used <Complete> on a name change, and now the file is inaccessible
   to the normal deletion methods.

Use Dired.  Or give Delete File a starname that uniquely matches part
of the name of the file (no good if the entire file name consists of
the #\Complete character).

You should be able to delete it by listing the directory with Show
Directory, clicking right on the file name, and selecting "Delete File"
from the menu.  Or use a wildcard with the Delete File command (if there
are other files that match the wildcard, use the :Query option).

   Yup.

Right.  But the difference was: for the name of the overall software
system of the Symbolics machine, Ilene and a large committee and a
very large cast of in-house volunteer survey subjects exhaustively
considered all the names; the choice was Genera.  But that was so
exhausting, distracting, and expensive, that the committees and
process for considering names for all the components (cf. above) were
scaled way back.  The result was that Genera was fairly successful for
the purpose it was designed for (good thing, too), while all the other
gimmicky names scored between C- and F.

   I recall suspecting said image consultants didn't quite have a grip on
   reality when they confused the (then-new) adaptive hash-table system
   with a spreadsheet ("They're tables, right?") and clept them
   "PlanMaster."  (I think the hashtables ended up getting called
   SmartStore.  Why does there have to be an embedded capital or
   punctuation mark?)

Yeah, but what can you expect, when we often couldn't explain features
of the system very well to potential customers who were actual
engineers.  These consultants were just refugees from advertising
agencies.  There was also the case of SCT, System Construction Tool.
They had a hard time even pretending to understand what it was about,
and came up with just a few totally wrong name ideas.  The Symbolians
on the committee couldn't think of a gimmicky name better than SCT
either, so we just left it that.

Remember also the later adventures of SmartStore.  A couple of years
ago, somebody in the vending business (I think) wanted to trademark
that name, and found that guess who owned it.  They made some paying
arrangement with Symbolics for the use of the name; I never did find
out the details.  Clearly Symbolics should have stockpiled more of
those silly names.

Subject: unix-lpd protocol

How does one "install/activate" the unix-lpd protocol (for Genera 8.0
for a 3670) so that hardcopy will print on a UNIX printer?  I have got
this working for Genera 7.2 using Chris Lindblad's code.  I have tried
the recommended namespace procedures in the manuals and even tried
installing "ux support" but got into problems with having to install
"embedding support" or "macivory-support."

Thanks in advance.

I think you have to install Embedding Support, as UX Support depends on
it.  Despite the name, there's no harm in loading this on a non-embedded
system.

Other than this, it's basically the same as Chris's code.

It's ok.  We'll just see if this brings more or less people to the

Subject: backing up several machines to one tape?


I have 3 symbolics machines (two ivories, one non-ivory); one of the ivories
has an exabyte drive on it.  I'd like to back up all three LMFSes onto the
exabyte.  Is there a simple way to do this (preferably without a lot of mouse
action)?

Make sure that the machine with the tape drive has

	Service: TAPE TCP RTAPE
	Service: TAPE CHAOS RTAPE

in its namespace entry.  Then when the dumper asks where you want to
dump to, specify "name:device", where "name" is the name of the machine
with the tape drive, and "device" is the name of the Exabyte drive on
that machine (I'm not sure how SCSI devices are named on Ivory systems).
The machine running the dump will then connect to the tape server over
the network.

   Make sure that the machine with the tape drive has

	   Service: TAPE TCP RTAPE
	   Service: TAPE CHAOS RTAPE

It is best to leave out the CHAOS service entry.  You really never want to use
CHAOS, and sometimes when the machine is loaded, the client machine
will try CHAOS instead of TCP, thinking the tape server is unreachable
via TCP.  Chaos doesn't have the software end-to-end checksum that TCP
has, and you might find that extra checksum useful.  So just add TAPE
TCP RTAPE.

   in its namespace entry.  Then when the dumper asks where you want to
   dump to, specify "name:device", where "name" is the name of the machine
   with the tape drive, and "device" is the name of the Exabyte drive on
   that machine (I'm not sure how SCSI devices are named on Ivory systems).
   The machine running the dump will then connect to the tape server over
   the network.

						   barmar

You can use SCSI<n> for the "device" field, where <n> is the unit
number.  If you don't know what the SCSI unit number of the exabyte
is, use the :Show Machine Configuration command, specifying the host
to which the tape drive is physically connected.

I bet you really want to write some script which will automatically
dump all three LMFSii without any operator intervention.
Unfortunately, I don't know of any such batch facility.  Perhaps
someone else on SLUG has already hacked up something.  Failing that,
you could try to read the LMFS sources.  There is some good stuff in
there.

The real problem is that you have to perform a LMFS backup on the
machine whose filesystem is being backed up.  You can connect to a
tape drive attached to some other machine, but you are still going to
have to run three separate backup operations for the three machines.

    ... The real question is: How do you retrieve from a specific hosts' lmfs
    backup dump?

Speaking of "how do you retrieve", I recently contemplated buying an
exabyte drive for my Macivory and was independently warned by several
people that (in their opinion) exabyte is a terrible medium in which to
do backups.  The word I got is that people have found it to have
higher-than-average risk of not being able to retrieve data from at all,
and that it's especially bad in the case where you're reusing the same
tape over and over (as one would presumably do with incrementals).  I
didn't try it myself, so this is third-hand info at best, but it's worth
actually checking some of your exabyte backups before you are desperate
for them to convince yourself that they're really storing your data in a
retrievable way.  Personally, I wish smbx would provide support for DAT
drives, which are more popular, more widely available, much cheaper, and
reputed to be more reliable.

    I bet you really want to write some script which will automatically
    dump all three LMFSii without any operator intervention.
    Unfortunately, I don't know of any such batch facility.  Perhaps
    someone else on SLUG has already hacked up something.  Failing that,
    you could try to read the LMFS sources.  There is some good stuff in
    there.

Here's something I hacked for someone to let them backup their
LMFS at off peak time (i.e. when no-one was around).  Of course the backup
has to fit on one tape, but that's not normally a problem with exabyte.
I guess it should be possible to dump 3 LMFSii if two of the machines
specify :TRY-APPEND T, though I've never tried appending LMFS backups so I've
no idea whether that will work.  Also you might need to hack things to handle
any queries that the :TRY-APPEND T option might throw at the operator.

   The real question is: How do you retrieve from a specific hosts' lmfs
   backup dump?

You mount the tape containing that host's dump, and do the retrieval.  Each
backup needs to be on its own tape, just as with other tape formats.

    The real question is: How do you retrieve from a specific hosts' lmfs
    backup dump?

If you dump the LMFS from several machines onto one Exabyte tape then
you can't retrieve the LMFS from just one of the machines.  I backed up
two of our machines onto a single 8mm tape using an Exabyte EXB-8200
drive. When I listed the contents of the tape, what I saw was a single
LMFS dump which contained the LMFS of both machines.

The Exabyte tapes seem to be fairly reliable.  I backup my XL1200 onto
one every week and we backup several Gigabytes worth of Sun and DEC
filesystems onto them each day.  The real important thing to remember is
that Exabyte drives show the effects of dirty heads sooner than other
drives so it is very important to clean the drive regularly.
Fortunately, Exabyte produces their own head cleaner which makes the job
very easy (you put the cleaning tape into the drive and it does the
rest).

sys:embedding;ux;unix-lpd.bin.newest had to be loaded via restore.
(unix-lpd.bin had to be manually generated from the .lisp source).

But then when I tried the hardcopy command, I get:

    Error: Remote error: "seaver: /usr/etc/lpd:         : Your host does
    not have line printer access"
    
    (DEFUN-IN-FLAVOR PRINT::LPD-GET-ACK PRINT::LPD-MIXIN)
       Arg 0 (SELF): #<PRINT::LPD-HARDCOPY-STREAM 2713463>
       Arg 1 (SYS:SELF-MAPPING-TABLE): PRINT::LPD-MIXIN
       Arg 2 (STREAM): #<TCP:NARY-UNIX-LPD HARDCOPY for host SEAVER
    printer "gatorprint"
    s-B:           Retry invoking HARDCOPY (UNIX-LPD) -- SEAVER on
    INTERNET.
    s-C:           Specify a printer to use instead of Gatorprint.
    s-D, :    Exit process CP Hardcopy File I:>WLIM>lispm-init.lisp.newest



Indira (the 3670) exists in Seaver's (an SGI Crimsom) /etc/hosts.equiv
and /etc/hosts.lpd files.  (NFS works just fine.)

Question: Which machine does "your host" in the error message refer
to?  My guess is Indira (right?).  The reason why I'm asking this
question is that gatorprint (I hate that name), the printer, is not
really directly connected to Seaver, it is a networked printer
accessed through Seaver.  And for more gory details, gatorprint is an
Appletalk printer accessed by Seaver through a Gatorbox (that explains
the rather silly printer name).


Why not have Indira talk to the Gatorbox directly?  Well that is the
plan but we want to make sure that the UNIX support for hardcopy works
with a UNIX host first before messing around with the Gatorbox and
Appletalk.  I may have to connect a printer directly to Seaver to
prove to a bunch skeptics* that the UNIX support of hardcopy works.

	   ... The real question is: How do you retrieve from a specific hosts' lmfs
	   backup dump?

       Speaking of "how do you retrieve", I recently contemplated buying an
       exabyte drive for my Macivory and was independently warned by several
       people that (in their opinion) exabyte is a terrible medium in which to
       do backups.  The word I got is that people have found it to have
       higher-than-average risk of not being able to retrieve data from at all,
       and that it's especially bad in the case where you're reusing the same
       tape over and over (as one would presumably do with incrementals).  I
       didn't try it myself, so this is third-hand info at best, but it's worth
       actually checking some of your exabyte backups before you are desperate
       for them to convince yourself that they're really storing your data in a
       retrievable way.  Personally, I wish smbx would provide support for DAT
       drives, which are more popular, more widely available, much cheaper, and
       reputed to be more reliable.

   The Exabyte tapes seem to be fairly reliable.  I backup my XL1200 onto
   one every week and we backup several Gigabytes worth of Sun and DEC
   filesystems onto them each day.  The real important thing to remember is
   that Exabyte drives show the effects of dirty heads sooner than other
   drives so it is very important to clean the drive regularly.
   Fortunately, Exabyte produces their own head cleaner which makes the job
   very easy (you put the cleaning tape into the drive and it does the
   rest).

   Craig Lanning <CLanning@trc.scra.org>

If you decide to use exabyte technology, be sure to use data-grade 8mm
tape.  The K-mart special 8mm video-grade tapes might appear to work
until you really need the data off the tape.  Be sure to use the
compare backup tape facility for checking your backups from time to
time.  As Craig says, clean heads are also vital.

   But then when I tried the hardcopy command, I get:

       Error: Remote error: "seaver: /usr/etc/lpd:         : Your host does

   Indira (the 3670) exists in Seaver's (an SGI Crimsom) /etc/hosts.equiv
   and /etc/hosts.lpd files.  (NFS works just fine.)

The fact that NFS works is meaningless, since NFS access control is
completely unrelated to lpd access control.

One problem may be the form of the name in hosts.equiv; if you have the
fully qualified domain name, Seaver might be expecting just the host
portion, or vice versa.  There could also be case sensitivity problems.
Telnet to Seaver from Indira and see how the host name shows up in "who".

I'm not sure of all this, though; we don't use hosts.lpd and our
hosts.equiv just contains the "+" wildcard (we use a firewall to protect us
from outside systems).

   Why not have Indira talk to the Gatorbox directly?  Well that is the
   plan but we want to make sure that the UNIX support for hardcopy works
   with a UNIX host first before messing around with the Gatorbox and
   Appletalk.  I may have to connect a printer directly to Seaver to
   prove to a bunch skeptics* that the UNIX support of hardcopy works.

Theoretically, the Lispm should be able to talk to the Gatorbox directly.
Gatorprint is supposed to emulate a Unix LPD server.  We were looking into
using Gatorprint from our Unix systems (we currently use CAP and
Transcript), but punted when we discovered that Gatorprint can't print DVI
files; so I never got around to trying it from the Lispms.

Of course, sending directly to the Gatorbox might not solve this problem,
since it presumably has an access list as well.

       The real question is: How do you retrieve from a specific hosts' lmfs
       backup dump?

    You mount the tape containing that host's dump, and do the retrieval.  Each
    backup needs to be on its own tape, just as with other tape formats.

This is what I'm doing now but I'd like to backup multiple hosts to a
single tape and be able to retrieve each dump separately.  Even though
the tapes are relatively cheap I'd still like to fill them up as much as
possible.

  We are going to be a subcontractor on a proposal with another company.  The
  prime contractor will be converting our Common-Lisp code to C.  Their pricing
  to the client will be based on the number of C lines they expect to "write".
  
  Does anyone have any empirical data on lines of Lisp to lines of C  (yes, I
  know it is *extremely* variable -- eg, whether we need a GC)?   Also, does
  anyone have any data on the relative cost of those lines compared to lines
  of C written from scratch?
  
  -------

Here's some ideas that might provide a crude estimate.  You probably don't
want to use these factors without thinking about them, or doing a micro
conversion.  For the code in your Lisp application:

Factor  x  each line of
2          Class or structure definition
            1 line for the .c file, one for the .h file.

1.5         Function or method
              1 for the line of code , + a bit for any declarations, + a
              bit since method dispatch must be hand coded.

To this add

Factor  x  Number of 
1          :Reader or :Writer methods
1          Generic function.


You will need to add an estimate for a C++ "library" that provides the
pieces of Lisp you want, like lists and GC...  you can get estimates from
sizes of existing libraries, such as NIHCL.  Reference counting (yuk) GC's
are commonly described (see a book called "Advanced C++ programming").
While a GC scheme may increase the number of lines in a class definition,
it wouldn't shouldn't add to the rest of the code.  If you are going to use
(rather than write) a class library, estimate an "interface" to it of say
10 to 20% of its size.

This doesn't say anything about user interfaces.  If you were going from
dynamic windows to X, you might do something like add 1 line for each
keyword argument in a function call, or something.

Hope this helps.

I am having problems with my Macivory and am looking for some advice on
what, if anything, I should focus on trying to fix.

The Problems:
1) Numerous times the Fep will not start. Double clicking on the genera
   icon will show the macivory menubar but the Fep's window will not
   appear, and after about 1 minute, the dialog indicating the Fep did not
   start appears. Sometimes restarting the mac and trying to start Genera
   would solve the problem.
2) Rearranging the boards would sometimes help. I tried a program called
   Zap! for zapping the pram. It did not do any good.
3) When Genera does start it will occasionally freeze up within the
   first few minutes of operation. No redrawing  of windows, the clock
   stops, no run bars, no response to mouse clicks.   The other mac
   programs continue to work fine.
4) When Genera does start up and does not freeze up for a few minutes it
   tends to continue running. The only thing odd (maybe a clue) is that the
   icon displayed in the multifinder list is not the Macivory icon but the
   Thunder spell checker icon, another init and program I have.

Questions:
1) Can anyone tell from the above descriptions if my problem is hardware
   or software?
2) Should I start removing inits? I have the Thunder spell checker
   mentioned above in addition to After Dark which I was told had some
   problems.

Software Configuration:
1) As I write this mail I am running Genera 8.3 on top of Macintosh System 7.0.
2) I have tried various combinations of Genera 8.3 and 8.1.1 and
   Macintosh System 7.0 and 7.1. Same problems.

Hardware Configuration:
The main difference from the original Macivory configuration is the
replacement of a burned out Radius monitor with a SuperMac monitor and
card.
1) Macintosh IIx: 68030 CPU, FPA, Apple Extended Keyboard II.
2) Motherboard: Macintosh II (id #x10).
3) NuBus slot 9: SuperMac Technology SuperMac Spectrum/8 Series III v1.2
   p/n (id #x261) s/n rev 1.2.
4) NuBus slot A: National Semiconductor NS8/16 Memory Expansion Card p/n
   NS8/16 (id #x10F) rev Rev. 2.21, 16MB tota l, 2.6MW in use.
5) NuBus slot B: Symbolics Inc. MacIvory Processor p/n MacIvory-2 (id
   #x14F) s/n 021006 rev 10.0, Ivory rev2B.
6) SCSI address 0: MAXTOR XT-8380S B6B, direct access, 694302 blocks of
   512 bytes (339M bytes total).
7) SCSI address 1: MAXTOR LXT-213S 4.55, direct access, 415436 blocks of
   512 bytes (203M bytes total).
8) SCSI address 3: SONY CD-ROM CDU-8002 1.8g, removable CD-ROM, 1243520

I'd appreciate any advice.

Thanks,
Kevin

I have a couple of Symbolics hacks:

1) A 2 dimensional scientific graph plotter. 
2) A concordia to winhelp converter. 

Anybody who wants them can have them - a couple of people have asked
already - but I can't keep sending big files from my MacIvory with my
Tandy 1200 baud modem - is there a communal place to put these things?

Subject: X-11 Server files missing....


Hi folks,

When trying to get my 3630 to start an X server process, I get an error
to the effect that a certain file is missing:

>rel-8-1>x11>server>rgb.text.newest

Since my machine has a monochrome 60Hz monitor, I presume that rgb.text
is not applicable. Trouble is, how do I circumvent the load operation ?
Failing that, does anyone have a copy of the file which they would care
to let me have via email ?

Best wishes,

Colin

This file is used to translate symbolic color names to RGB values.  I
haven't tried it, but you could just create an empty file.  However,
some applications will reference colors by name even when they're
running on a monochrome terminal (they expect the terminal to map the
RGB to something appropriate), so you may get errors from this.

    Failing that, does anyone have a copy of the file which they would care
    to let me have via email ?

If you have any Unix machines running X, just copy the file from there.
It's just an ordinary text file.

If you can't find it at your site, let me know and I'll mail it to you.

Subject: Help syncing video


When the discussion was going on a couple of weeks ago about the merits of
Symbolics and how no one has duplicated the environment, I happened to be
in the process of decommissioning all of my Symbolics'.  It was rather
poignant, to say the least.

Anyway, there is one 3670 that I am still using as a print server (seem's
like an ignoble end for that machine, doesn't it?).  Over the weekend we
had a power outage in the building, and now I can't get the video to sync
up on the monitor - all I get are the narrow, wandering horizontal bands.
I have tried "reset video" to no useful effect.  "Set Monitor Mon" seems to give
just marginally better results than "Set Monitor Phil", but I really can't
remember what other incantations might be useful for getting a clearer
picture on the screen.  Can anyone help me?

The monitor I am using has no vents on the top, but I have quite a selection
of other monitors around that I can try if the need arises ;-)

Thanks in advance for any help.

I presume that you normally have the monitor on your 3670 turned on.  There are
two effects that you may be seeing.  I find that some monitor's ability to
synch horizontally is affected by the internal temperature.  In short, leave it
on for a while (> 30 minutes) and then do reset video.

If that doesn't do it, then it probably has drifted with age far enough out that
you have to twiddle the horiz synch (or horiz osc., but I don't think your
monitor has it) on the inside of the case.  When we have power failures, I
usually have to go around and tweak a few.  While the machine was on it was
still able to synch but once the monitor is powered off, it is enough out of
whack that you have to fix it yourself.

Of course the recommendation is to let your friendly Symbolics repair man
do it for you.  There are high voltages and they aren't user-friendly.
In any case, don't use anything metal (including your watch) inside the case!

STACK-LET is driven off the entries in the alist
SI:*STACK-LET-OPERATIONS*.  It uses this to translate function calls
into corresponding WITH-STACK-xxx bindings.  Here's an addition that
does what you want.

(defmacro with-stack-make-list ((var size &key initial-element) 
				&body body)
  ;; Use ,VAR for both bindings, so don't need a GENSYM!
  `(stack-let* ((,var (zl:make-array ,size :type sys:art-q-list
				     :initial-value ,initial-element)) 
                (,var (g-l-p ,var)))
     ,@body))

(eval-when (compile load eval)
  (pushnew '(make-list 1 nil with-stack-make-list)
	   si:*stack-let-operations* :key #'car))

is it possible to re-use an old symbolics monochrome monitor on

I've looked at the mono machines, and I know that there's only one
line going into the monitors, so it's gotta be pretty simple. the

(color tubes are more obvious, all you need is the appropriate cable
to split the normal PC-VGA cable into RGB coax...)

but right now I'm concerned about the mono monitors...has anyone done
this? does anyone know?

I'm just curious.  I'd like to collect any success stories
out there about using Concordia.  Could you please send me
(individually please, not to the whole net) any descriptions
of successes that you know about in industrial or government
settings.  If you've written up a tech report or submitted
something for publication, so much the better (copy or
pointer please!)

I have no particular purpose in mind.  It is just the
juxtaposition of two things -- my noticing that it is five
years since the first shipping of Concordia and my current
efforts on a program committee, reading some research papers
that claim there are no such tools in existence.

Thanks for any info.  Maybe I'll even do something with it,
depending on the whole set of what I learn.

Cheers,
Jan

if you don't know how to ftp from your machine.  Do a ftp to
cambridge.apple.com (134.149.2.3), enter "anonymous" as user-id, then
<your-name>@<your-host.domain> as the password.

Use the ftp "cd pub/clim" command to change to the correct directory and
try "dir" to see the directory. (use "help" to see other ftp commands)

To get files use the ftp "get" command, to put your files on the server,
use "put".

There is also a mailing list discussing CLIM: send a request for
subscription to clim-request@bbn.com

cc: selvin@TEXAS.nynexst.com

I'm shopping for good courses in LISP programming (and/or CLOS, CLIM,
etc.) and object-oriented analysis. The ideal course would be more
theory- and analysis-oriented than coding-oriented, and would not
presume too heavy a programming background. Courses in the NYC area
preferred. Anything from a 1-3 day workshop to a semester-long college
course OK.

Thanks for any recommendations.

    The fact that there is "only one line" going to the monitor doesn't
   necessarily make it "simple".  I'm assuming you're refering to the
   non-3600 style Symbolics monitor which is more widely found than the
   older LEMO style 3600 monitor's used on pre 1984 3600's and LM-2's. 
   (does anyone still have one of them? We still use 3600 S/N 581 but
   it's console's been upgraded from a LEMO to a PE Video).
    
   The single line you refer to is actually a 12 pin Hirose connector 
   that passes

    Symbolics sold a "Wallbox assembly" that allowed the customer to
    break this single line into seperate lines.  We do that at KSC because
    some of our Symbolics consoles are located close to a 1000ft away from
    our CPU's.  (our main computer room is located on the far back end
    of the 4th floor of the Operations and Checkout Building at KSC and
    the consoles are in front offices on the 2nd floor.  The building is
    over 800ft long).
  
    I seriously doubt that you can fully use this monitor with any other
    computer system but you can daisy-chain consoles to each other to provide
    multiple (identical) video displays from a single Symbolics Computer.
    You may also be able to get it to sync with the video output from some
    other computer system but I doubt you'd could ever get the keyboard to
    to work with another system without some serious rewiring and major 
    hardware design.  The mouse can be reused if you cut off the connector
    and rewire it.  To use the video source from a different computer, it
    would have to have nearly identical video specifications to the
    Symbolics monitor (which is highly doubtful). The Symbolics console 
    isn't "Multisync" like some PC variety monitors. You must send exactly
    the video signal it is expecting or it will not sync.    You can find
    more detailed specs in the source files of the console sync programs
    but some of the specifications are:
  
              1124 x 904 pixel display (100 Mhz?)
              60Hz Non-interlaced refresh

    The fact that there is "only one line" going to the monitor doesn't
   necessarily make it "simple".  I'm assuming you're refering to the
   non-3600 style Symbolics monitor which is more widely found than the
   older LEMO style 3600 monitor's used on pre 1984 3600's and LM-2's. 
   (does anyone still have one of them? We still use 3600 S/N 581 but
   it's console's been upgraded from a LEMO to a PE Video).
    
   The single line you refer to is actually a 12 pin Hirose connector 
   that passes
  
        Pin
         1.  XMIT- Digital Audio serial data from system to the console
         2.  XMIT+ Digital Audio serial data from system to the console
         3.  TXD-  Biphase serial from system to console (console serial port)
         4.  TXD+  Biphase serial from system to console (console serial port)
         5.  RXD-  Biphase serial data from console to system (keyboard)
         6.  RXD+  Biphase serial data from console to system (keyboard)
         7.  RCV-  Audio Clock
         8.  RCV+  Autio Clock
         9.  Phase Encoded Video
        10.  Video Ground
        11.  Serial Ground
        12.  Ground
  
    Symbolics sold a "Wallbox assembly" that allowed the customer to
    break this single line into seperate lines.  We do that at KSC because
    some of our Symbolics consoles are located close to a 1000ft away from
    our CPU's.  (our main computer room is located on the far back end
    of the 4th floor of the Operations and Checkout Building at KSC and
    the consoles are in front offices on the 2nd floor.  The building is
    over 800ft long).
  
    I seriously doubt that you can fully use this monitor with any other
    computer system but you can daisy-chain consoles to each other to provide
    multiple (identical) video displays from a single Symbolics Computer.
    You may also be able to get it to sync with the video output from some
    other computer system but I doubt you'd could ever get the keyboard to
    to work with another system without some serious rewiring and major 
    hardware design.  The mouse can be reused if you cut off the connector
    and rewire it.  To use the video source from a different computer, it
    would have to have nearly identical video specifications to the
    Symbolics monitor (which is highly doubtful). The Symbolics console 
    isn't "Multisync" like some PC variety monitors. You must send exactly
    the video signal it is expecting or it will not sync.    You can find
    more detailed specs in the source files of the console sync programs
    but some of the specifications are:
  
              1124 x 904 pixel display (100 Mhz?)
              60Hz Non-interlaced refresh
              P104 phosphor
              Aspect ratio 1.27 horizontal to vertical
  
  
     Hope this helps,
                              Jim

subject: what to buy as a functional equivalent of a Symbolics?

Could anybody out there help us in the following problem?

We have an old Symbolics 3620 that is very good in all respects
but our founding agencies want more compatibility in new
installments. So we would like to buy a functional equivalent
of our old pet.

I have seen some workstations with add-on cards, but what are
your experiences? Needless to say, we need something from the
lower half of the pricelist.

Many thanks - if anybody wants to have a summary of the
responses, I will compile one.

PROGRAM	
	The Association of Lisp Users is pleased to announce the Third
International Lisp Users and Vendors Conference.  Sponsored by the
Association of Lisp Users and vendors of Lisp and Lisp-based products,
including Franz, Lucid, Harlequin, Venue,and Itasca. LUV '93 will be another
opportunity for users to exchange ideas and promote the benefits of the
Lisp programming language.
	The Association of Lisp Users is the voice of the international Lisp
user community.  By holding our annual conference, we promote communication
and the dissemination of information between the vendors of Lisp and Lisp
applications, and the users of these products.  Our opinions are sought by
the Lisp industry, most of which is well represented at our annual
conference.
	The theme for LUV '93 is Lisp and Education.  For over 20 years,
Lisp has been used to teach advanced computer science topics at major
universities.  Now, introductory computer science courses are being taught
using dialects of Lisp, allowing students to concentrate on basic concepts
and principles instead of mechanics. Many of the features of Lisp that make
it a popular language for education have also caused Industry to embrace
Lisp. They have done this by learning to use the Lisp-based extension
languages embedded in popular applications, such as AutoCAD, GNU Emacs,
and Interleaf.  
	In this year's conference, Monday and Tuesday are dedicated to
improving Lispers' software engineering skills through two days of tutorials.
Featured speakers will include David Moon of Apple Computer, Inc. on
Wednesday along with technical & paper presentations. Special interest
group meetings will also be held Wednesday. On Thursday the vendors will be
making presentations about their lastest products. Friday the Annual Meeting
will be held followed by the traditional no-cost tutorial (topic still to
be determined).

LOCATION/ACCOMODATIONS
	This year the conference returns to the birthplace of Lisp and one
of the primary centers of the present day Lisp community, Cambridge, MA.
Our host hotel is the Cambridge Marriott, conveniently located at the
Kendall Square station on the red line and adjacent to MIT.  Nearby Boston
attractions include Harvard Square, Beacon Hill and Feneuil Hall
Marketplace.
A limited number of rooms have been reserved at a conference rate of
$98 single & $108 double/night.  Please complete the housing form indicating your hotel
preferences and reservations will be made for you and guaranteed for late
arrival (after 6pm) if you include a credit card number.  Any changes in
your reservations before August 1st should be directed to An Event To Remember,
the conference organizers; changes after August 1st should be made directly
with the hotel.

SPECIAL AIRFARE
	The Association of Lisp Users has designated Carlson Travel
Network/Pack n' Go Travel as the official travel agency for LUV '93.
Pack n' Go Travel can arrange for travel from any point of origin and 
guarantee the best airfare on the market.  Even after tickets have been 
issued, CTN/Pack n' Go Travel continues to monitor airfares and can reticket
to obtain a lower fare if one becomes available.
	The Association of Lisp Users has also negotiated special conference
airfares through Continental Airlines.  Each participant will receive 5% off
the lowest available fare when booked through CTN/Pack n' Go Travel. Please
call CTN/Pack n' Go Travel to make your flight arrangements:

TUTORIAL SCHEDULE/DESCRIPTIONS

Monday Tutorials

Monday AM:
CLOS I: Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp
	This half day tutorial is an introduction to the Common
Lisp Object System, the object oriented extention to the proposed
ANSI standard Common Lisp. Attendees are expected to be familiar with
Common Lisp programming concepts.(Instructor: Allan Wechsler,Symbolics,Inc.)

Interfacing Lisp with Other Languages
	Lisp applications can access code written in other programming
languages via Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs).  The primary focus
of this tutorial will be to show how C code and data may be used
within Common Lisp.  Examples will be drawn from UNIX and possibly PC
Common Lisp implementations. (Instructor: Charley Cox, Franz Inc.)

GNU EMACS Lisp Programming
	This half day tutorial will present the EMACS expension
language, EMACS Lisp which allows users to not only customize the
popular EMACS editor, but also allows the development of active
documents applications that interact with the user.
(Instructor: to be determined)

Monday PM:

CLOS II-Advanced CLOS and the Meta-Object Protocol
	This tutorial will cover meta-object protocols for CLOS as well as
existing implementational techniques and their consequences. Also to be
covered are advanced topics such as complex initializations protocols. A
good understanding of CLOS as well as Lisp is assumed.
(Instructor: Jon L. White, Lucid, Inc.)

Metaprogramming using Macros
	The Common Lisp macro facility is extremely powerful, but it's
advanced features can be difficult to use. Learn when and how to use macros
to improve your coding style and productivity.
(Instructor: Allan Wechsler,Symbolics,Inc.)

Closures, Continuations, and Coroutines
	The "continuation passing" style of programming is a powerful
technique that can be used to implement a number of useful control
structures, including backtracking and coroutines, in a simple and
elegant manner.  Continuation passing can be confusing if you are not
familiar with it, but this tutorial will teach you to understand and
write programs using this technique.
(Instructor: Louis Steinberg, Rutgers Univ.)

Tuesday Tutorials

Tuesday AM:
CLIM I
	This tutorial will show how to use the Common Lisp Interface Manager
to build interfaces to appllication programs. Topics to be covered include
application frames,presentations,menus and dialogs,commands,command tables,
interaction styles, and drawing graphics. Knowledge of Lisp is assumed.
(Instructor: to be determined)

Common Lisp for Scheme Programmers
	This tutorial will introduce Scheme Lisp programming to
experienced Common Lisp programmers. Scheme programming concepts will
be presented in a way that allows experienced Common lisp programmers
to contrast these two main stream Lisp dialects.
(Instructor: Allan Wechsler,Symbolics,Inc.)

Good Lisp Programming Style
	This tutorial will present good Lisp programming style heuristics.
It will deal with style issues at the individual function level as well as
at the complete system level.(Instructor: to be determined)

Tuesday PM:
CLIM II
	This tutorial builds on the concepts covered in CLIM I(a pre-
requisite to taking this course). Topics to be covered include hardcopy,
pointer manipulation,tracking the pointer, incremental redisplay,table and
graph formatting,drawing in color,the drawing environment, and doing
transformations.(Instructor: to be determined)


Scheme for Common Lisp Programmers
	This tutorial will introduce Common Lisp programming to
experienced Scheme Lisp programmers. Common Lisp programming concepts
will be presented in a way that allows experienced Scheme Lisp
programmers to contrast these two main stream Lisp dialects.
(Instructor: Allan Wechsler,Symbolics,Inc.)

Optimizing Lisp Code
	This tutorial will first present some general guidelines to
optimizing Lisp code that can be used regardless of specific Lisp system
details. Then specific details will be presented that are more relevant to 
a given Lisp compiler implementation.  Topics will include profiling,
some common algorithmic optimizations, consing, declarations and type
checking, garbage collection, using C code, arrays and delivery
considerations. (Instructor: Jim Veitch, Franz Inc.)

Subject: CD-ROM on Sun as SYS host

Has anyone set up a CD-ROM on a Sun as their SYS host?  The Genera 8.3
documentation suggests that this is possible, but the instructions are
incorrect and/or incomplete on how to do it.

The problem is that dash characters have been replaced by underscores in the
CD-ROM filenames.  I had assumed that this would be fairly easy to correct
using the logical pathname mechanisms.  But pathname translations are clearly
inadequate, since a filename may have an arbitrary number of underscores.  None
of the predefined translation rules seem appropriate (:vms-heuristicate allows
character substitution, but also does other nasty things).  It would appear
that I need to code a new translation rule to do the job...

1) Am I missing some easier fix?
2) If not, has someone already written such a translation rule?

			Thanks!

Actually, I think the instructions say that it isn't possible, but
that's wrong (mostly)

Yes, I wrote such a thing a long time ago.  It works pretty well,
_except_ for systems with patches (at least in Genera 8.1, which I am
running).  The problem with patches is that the system utility has
HARD WIRED pathnames for the "PATCH-DIRECTORY;" or some such logical
pathname component, bypassing the pathname translation stuff.  There
are also problems using the Documentation System from CD, but it works
most of the time. Here is my sys:site;sys.translations file.  Remember
this is 8.1 and I wrote it a long time ago.  Looking at the code, it
reminds me that you will need to have your fonts in a real directory,
but I don't remember why.  See the last two entries in the
:translations for the interesting bits, plus the :site-rules entry.

Are you thinking of the 8.1 instructions? The 8.3 instructions
explicitly say you CAN do it. Symbolics S/W support had a few
corrections to the instructions from the 8.3 installation docs, but I
was still unable to get it to work, at least in the brief attempts I
made. They were unable to figure out why, especially since they said
they could do it on a Sun with SunOS 4.1.2 (we have 4.1.1). However,
we didn't try for too long, since we had relatively easy access to a
spare CDROM, and hung it off our NXP, which worked fine the first
time. (Wow! All that free disk space now...  :-). My guess is that
only a minor variation of the 8.3 instructions will work.

My monitor is acting up to the point where when I turn it on, it screams
for a while (hi voltage board?). Finally it syncs up and works fine,
but I dont want to leave the machine booted since it is noisy, and
I want the monitor to work for some deadlines coming up.

I need to drag a spare out of storage but that is more work than leaving
the monitor on. This model has the top slots, and the LED display
that says FOO on booting, at the upper left (moniterm?).


Any implications for leaving the monitor on without getting any sync
from the machine? thanks

Subject: character styles in zmacs

Hi there,

We trying to develop application in lisp which are source-compatible
and portable across unix- (i.e. Lucid-), Genera- and macintosh-based
platforms. To this end, we are using CLIM, a shared filesystem and
a portable defsystem etc. So far, so good. However, its convinient
to have an editor that supports different character styles a la
electric character style lock mode in zmacs. The problem is that
the editor should not write any font information into the source file.
On the macintosh I wrote something that automatically generates 
bold definition names and italic comments when reading in the 
source file.

For zmacs, I would like a similar approach. I think of a specilized
lisp mode which generates the styled definitions and comments during
reading. During editing it behaves like the existing el. char. style
lock mode, and when saving it strips any style information from the file
being saved.

I dont want to reinvent any code, so has anyone written something 
in this way that we could reuse?

Thanks for any comments - Stefan B.

Lemacs, Lucid's variant of GNU Emacs 19, has a very neat
implementation of the feature you describe.  It's in the file
lisp/packages/font-lock.el in the lemacs-19.6 distribution (older
versions didn't work as well).

Maybe you can port that back to Zmacs :-)

It's missing from the distribution.  If you have a Unix system running X
you can copy the file from there; it's probably someplace like
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.  It's just a text file that contains the
translation from color names to RGB values.

I wish to move two eagle disks from a 3600 to a 3670.  The 3600 is the site's
file server.  My plan is (1) plug the expansion cabinet onto the 3670
(2) identify the new disks as as fep1 and fep2, and (3) update the fep file
fspt.fspt to show the new lmfs partitions.

Qustion:  Will this plan work?  If not, what must I do to keep from copying
most of a gig?

P.S.  I know there is a slight cable difference between the 3600 and the 3670
and will use appropriate wires.  The above, is basically a software question
unless there is a hardware glitch besides the cabels.

Subject: Another X server question
Cc:	morse@zephyr.rap.ucar.EDU, cunning@zephyr.rap.ucar.EDU


Thanks to John Krieger and barmar for answering the question about rgb.text.

The X server starts fine, but I still have problems displaying an 
X application on ice, our XL400.  I can 
Start X Screen ice and have the "remote" screen appear in the X server window.
When I Halt X Screen, it says "Halting X Screen ICE:0.0".
However, on the unix side if I setenv DISPLAY ice:0.0 (or ICE:0.0)
in the usual unix notation, I get the errors - "Connection refused by server"
and "Can't open display".  If I setenv DISPLAY ice, the connection is made,
but I still get the "Can't open display" error.  How does one specify the
Symbolics screen on the unix side?

Thanks,
Cory Morse 	morse@zephyr.rap.ucar.edu

The problem about X connections refused may very well be a problem of
the Symbolics refusing connections from unauthorized hosts.  With 8.1,
Genera checks for incoming connections to be from authorized hosts.  I
use the following code which implements a (Symbolics) command "xhost"
which adds authorized hosts.

There's also code below that will let you fix the "xon" command that came
with X11 (I don't know if it is current though) to allow for X-terminal
type situations (where the "xhost" has to be executed on the display host,
not the CPU host).  The Symbolics display is like that.

Here's a file I load to set up the X terminals on my 3600:

    I wish to move two eagle disks from a 3600 to a 3670.  The 3600 is the site's
    file server.  My plan is (1) plug the expansion cabinet onto the 3670
    (2) identify the new disks as as fep1 and fep2, and (3) update the fep file
    fspt.fspt to show the new lmfs partitions.

    Qustion:  Will this plan work?  If not, what must I do to keep from copying
    most of a gig?

    Jeff Barnett

    P.S.  I know there is a slight cable difference between the 3600 and the 3670
    and will use appropriate wires.  The above, is basically a software question
    unless there is a hardware glitch besides the cabels.

It should work fine.  The only cable difference between the 3600 and
3670 is for the monitor.  They both use the same SMD disk cables.

If the disks contain the SYS:SITE; directory you'll need to do one of
two things:

1) Change the namespace and sys.translations file to identify the 3670
as the SYS host, or

2) Swap the names and addresses of the 3600 and 3670, by changing the
"Set Chaos-Address" commands in their respective boot files.

#1 will probably require saving out a new world for the 3670 so that the
namespace information will be in its image.  You'll probably also have
to change other logical host translations that refer to the old file
server.  #2 is much simpler, and will also allow references to a
physical host name (likely in user's lispm-init.lisp files) to continue
to work.  I recommend #2.

But if the 3670 already has a LMFS, I don't think you can turn two LMFS's into one 
this way.  I might be wrong but I remember that operation as being a lot more 
difficult.

It's been awhile since I worked with this, but I concur.  I don't
remember being able to merge LMFSs, only grow them and possibly split
them with partitioning.

Hi folks,

This isn't really a problem with the excellent xhost code mailed out
recently - my Genera 8.1 release appears not to have the Execute
Command facility..... I usually load the following systems and was
wondering if I have left out anything vital. If so, purleease let me
know. What is confusing is that the Document Examiner finds a section
dedicated to Execute Command somewhere in the bowels of the machine.

Systems:
Genera 8.1   
ip-tcp   
rpc   
embedding-support  
clx
x-remote-screen  
x-server  

Anybody got any ideas ?

I am reminded of a side effect of the exabyte discussion in the recent

on one tape as having the effect of merging the LMFSs into one. Kind
of a strange way to go about the current problem, but ...

Restoring world from cdrom mounted on a sun server works like a charm
for 3670 and 3640 using copy file (symbolics recommended procedure).
Seems to run ~100 times slower on 3650 -- in fact, not enough time in a
day to let it complete.  Eventually pops up a restart menu: longer timeout,
retry connection, etc.

Symbolics tried swapping io board, paddle, and processor.  Tried swapping
ethernet connection with one of the machines that works okay.  Nothing
helps.  Any known problems with 3650 in regards to this?  The only thing
I can think of is that NSF is sending a lot of long packets and the 3650
has a slow(?) fep.

    Restoring world from cdrom mounted on a sun server works like a charm
    for 3670 and 3640 using copy file (symbolics recommended procedure).
    Seems to run ~100 times slower on 3650 -- in fact, not enough time in a
    day to let it complete.  Eventually pops up a restart menu: longer timeout,
    retry connection, etc.

    Symbolics tried swapping io board, paddle, and processor.  Tried swapping
    ethernet connection with one of the machines that works okay.  Nothing
    helps.  Any known problems with 3650 in regards to this?  The only thing
    I can think of is that NSF is sending a lot of long packets and the 3650
    has a slow(?) fep.

Yes.  The problem is that the default read size is 8K, and this is
fragmented into 6 IP packets sent in rapid succession.  Unfortunately, a
G-machine can only read a couple of them, so the reassembly fails and
the Lispm eventually has to request a retransmission.  Of course, this
also fails, and so on.

Ths solution is to set NFS:*LOCAL-SUBNET-TRANSFER-SIZE* and
NFS:*LOCAL-NETWORK-TRANSFER-SIZE* to something the Lispm can handle.   I
use 1024 and it works OK.

That makes sense, but as a practical matter, I'd use :Copy World after the first one.
Both the disk access and network should be faster.

I need to transfer a 70 page monograph to Word 5.1 and I dont really
want to start drawing the figures from scratch in Canvas or something.
Does the default (or other) graphics format from Concordia do anything
useful to get me going here? Just importing (even if I cant continue
editing from the present versions) is helpful. 

I assumevi. text that the best I can do is grab the raw text and re-format
in Word.

To ALL or Anyone at SLUG:
 
I recently purchased a SYMBOLICS 3670 Mini-Computer at a Government Auction
which runs LISP, and after getting it home discovered that apparently it didn't
come with a console.  The computer is useless without the console.  I was
wondering if anyone has a console but no Mini-computer?  If so, perhaps we
could discuss putting our two useless components together for a functional
system.
 
If you have a console or know of one please contact me in any of the following
ways: Call (716) 671-6034,  Send E-MAIL to me through CompuServe at 72436,2556
or E-MAIL me at GENIE at XKY67755 or send some snail U.S. MAIL at 1486 Creek
Street, Rochester, NY  14625.  Sorry, but this is my first time using the
Internet and I don't have an Internet E-Mail Address so you'll have to contact
me by one of the other methods listed above.
 
Thanks for your time and interest.
 
                                  Sincerely,

from Unix, i can mount any of our lisp machines that support NFS
(or RPC or whatever) service, using for example:
	mount -t nfs lisphost:/ /unix-dir
This mounts the top-level LMFS directory, and everything works as expected.

now i have a cd-rom on lisphost that i can access from any lisp
machine (using NFILE or whatever), using for example:
	show directory lisphost|cdrom1:>*

how can i access the cd-rom from Unix, since variations on:
	mount -t nfs lisphost:X /unix-dir
don't work, where X has been:
	cdrom1
	cdrom1:/
	"lisphost|cdrom:>"
and all sorts of other likely combinations?

jpl
PS	if i install the CD-ROM on a Unix box, then i can access it
	from both Unix and lisp machines via NFS, since the CD will
	be mounted in the Unix file space.  There doesn't seem to be
	an analogous mechanism to link the CD-rom to LMFS file space,
	ie Mount Optical Disk seems to be for WORM drives or something.

I don't think it can be done, at least not in Genera 8.1.  Looking at
the NFS Server system, I see NFS-LMFS.LISP and NFS-FEPFS.LISP, which
suggests that the NFS server needs special-case code to handle
particular file system types; it doesn't do all its work through the
generic file system interface.  I see no NFS-CDROMFS.LISP.

Also, despite the use of Flavors to implement the LMFS and FEPFS
interfaces, the "generic" part of the NFS Server has stuff like:

  (etypecase pathname
    (fs:lmfs-pathname *lmfs-fsid*)
    (fs:fep-pathname (send (send pathname :host) :unit)))

in a number of places.  So much for OO programming....

You can supposedly do it in Genera 8.3. The documentation explicitly says
if is supported now (and that it wasn't in 8.1). However, I had trouble
getting it to work, and punted quickly since we had a spare CDROM player
sitting around. So we just hung that CDROM off our NXP. But Symbolics customer
support swears they have it working fine in 8.3 to a Sun running SunOS 4.1.3,
and that there are only minor errors in the 8.3 documentation that describes
how to do this.

BTW, Customer Support (Tina) also has a patch that allows CLIM 1.1 to be run
in Genera 8.3. It seems to work fine for our application. They (Naha) also
have an X-Server patch. They say it is only supported on monochrome, but
we use it on an 8-bit (32 doesn't work) color screen from our XL1200, and
can run OpenWindows, xterms, and FrameMaker at least as fast as the B&W
screen, and at much better resolution and looking just like our Sun screens.
A sad, sad day when our Symbolics are reduced to being X-terminals for our
Suns (only half a :-).

From:	jbarnett@charming.nrtc.northrop.com


We are using store and forward services on Unix machines -- no mail server
on the Lispms.  In the namspace, my user object shows my Lispm name as "jeff",
my Mail address as "jbarnett CHARMING", and my home host as "MERCURY".  When
someone on a Lispm composes a msg to "Jeff", it is handed to the store and
forward server addressed to "Jeff" rather than "jbarnett".  On the other
hand, if I send a msg to someone, Zmail is smart enough to make the return
address stuff say "jbarnett@CHARMING".  This behavior between resolving
destination and source is annoying.  Is there some simple approach (other
than using the same name on all machines or installing the Lsipm mailer
server) to get both from and to translations?

I don't know of anything like this.  When you're composing a message,
the destination fields are assumed to contain mail addresses, not user
names (leaving out the @domain part just means that you want this part
to be the local default).

In the cases where there's no conflict, you can set up aliases on the
Unix machine so that jeff@charming is translated to jbarnett@charming.
But if there's already a Unix username jeff then you're SOL.

Assume that we made our 36xx site configured worlds via the following:

1) Boot distribution world, set site, and load a bunch of software, etc.;

2) Do si:full-gc and an Optimize World;

3) Do a complete save of the world and distribute it.

Question: given that step 2) does a si:full-gc, etc., is the netboot core,
FEP:>NETBOOT-CORE-GENERA-8-3.LOAD, sufficient to boot our site configured
world?

Subject: NET problem - Do you have a patch for this one???
Date:	Thu, 1 Jul 1993 13:55:23 -0400
From:	jbarnett@charming.nrtc.northrop.com


The function TCB-PROCESS-ACK contains (one only) call to TIME-LESSP.  It
looks like (TIME-LESSP (TCB-NEXT-RETRANSMIT-TIME TCB) NOW).  Unfortunately,
in some cases, this passes NIL to TIME-LESSP.  The net (pardon the pun)
result, is to shut down the ethernet until we provide manual intervention.
This seems to be a new 8.3 bug.  Anybody else having the same problem?  If
so and you have a patch for this, please send it to me.

    1) Boot distribution world, set site, and load a bunch of software, etc.;

    2) Do si:full-gc and an Optimize World;

Do a FULL-GC before a complete save, or an Optimize World before an
incremental save.  You shouldn't do both before either.

    3) Do a complete save of the world and distribute it.

    Question: given that step 2) does a si:full-gc, etc., is the netboot core,
    FEP:>NETBOOT-CORE-GENERA-8-3.LOAD, sufficient to boot our site configured

Should be.  I think a netboot core can be used to boot any world that
uses the same microcode.

	netboot core, FEP:>NETBOOT-CORE-GENERA-8-3.LOAD, sufficient to
	boot our site configured world?

    Should be.  I think a netboot core can be used to boot any world
    that uses the same microcode.

One thing to watch out for is that a typical ethernet segment can only
handle three or four machines netbooting at the same time before it
starts getting too congested and the netboot clients get confused.  I
have our G and I machines set up with autoboot delays such that they
netboot in sets of four -- it's great for those 2 a.m. power outages.

Another bit of hard-earned advice:  Make sure you have a netboot core,
flods, microcode, and some paging space on *each* disk of multidisk
machines.  That way if one disk conks out you can still netboot a world
and possibly recover.

Subject: need some local (DC) help


I've just gotten some new/used hardware. I need to move some files
from a MacIvory onto these machines (3640 and 3620). problem is, my
MacIvory isn't behaving any more, so I can't get to the files on its
disk.

so, the help I need: someone in the DC area with a working unclass
MacIvory. I need to boot it from my disk, have it e-net'd to the 3620,
and do a file-transfer of around 200 files onto the 3620. I'd bring
the disk and the 3620.

an alternative: someone with a macivory and a e-net'd 36xx which can
make a tape.

please somebody help me out...

Many months ago, I ask this group for any comparative experiences with NXPs
and UXs.  No one responded -- probably because no one had both.  A few weeks
ago, we got some NXPs.  In the limited time that we have used them, we have
all been very impressed with their speed, easy of installation, compatibility,
etc.  Compared to the UX boards that we have, I see no disadvantages to the
NXPs.  Qua the limited time that we have used them, I recommend them to any of
you lucky enough to be acquiring new equipment.
