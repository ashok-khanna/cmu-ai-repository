This is from the Knowledge Interchange Format Reference manual:

  Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a computer-oriented language for
  the interchange of knowledge among disparate programs.  It has
  declarative semantics (i.e. the meaning of expressions in the
  representation can be understood without appeal to an interpreter for
  manipulating those expressions); it is logically comprehensive (i.e.
  it provides for the expression of arbitrary sentences in the
  first-order predicate calculus); it provides for the representation of
  knowledge about the representation of knowledge; it provides for the
  representation of nonmonotonic reasoning rules; and it provides for
  the definition of objects, functions, and relations.

This document is available via anonymous ftp from KSL.STANFORD.EDU in
/pub/knowledge-sharing/papers/kif.ps.  Other documents relevent to the
DARPA sponsored Knowledge Sharing Effort can be found in the same
directory.  You can also access these and other related documents via
the gopher server at gopher.cs.umbc.edu under the "Computer Science
Department" item.

The document begins:

  This manual is the ``living document'' of the Interlingua Working
  Group of the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort.  As such, it represents
  work in progress toward a proposal for a standard knowledge
  interchange format.

This is in spite of the fact that the entire knowledge representation
community (except for people getting funded to develop a standard) has
objected to the above description, saying that it is inappropriate to
develop a "standard" for knowledge interchange at the present time.

My impression from watching for a few years is that the KIF effort is
basically dead, except for the people working to foist a standard off on
the rest of us.  The only real risk -- and it *is* a real risk -- is
that the KIF folks convince the AI funders that knowledge representation
is "solved" and that everything done in the future should be
KIF-compatible.  The KIF developers have repeatedly been asked to carry
to ARPA the message that standards are premature, but they have refused
to do so.  There does, however, appear to be very little chance that the
rest of the community accepts the standard.

	BBCLIPS is an an extention of CLIPS.  It is developed by
National Research Council of Canada. I have read some papers related and
my understanding is that blackboard architecture is under the CLIPS.
(Fact base is blackboard and rule groups are knowledge source.) I may be
wrong in this because I do not really check latest version.

	I have also developed a Blackboard System using CLIPS and C.  I
have made several changes in CLIPS code myself. Result is more than one
CLIPS can work simultaneously and communicate via Blackboard. Each CLIPS
can have different knowledge. Also any C, or any other programs can join
the system if they are able to use same protocol to access to
Blackboard. (This system is only protocol.)

	There are several applications that are very similar to the
system that I have designed. I have written this system to be able to
verify my thesis. (Instead of buying GBB which is in LISP and incredibly
expensive.) I have not completed my thesis yet, therefore, it is not
avaiable to public.

	Also, GEST is a BBA and I do not really know which language they
have used to developed it. If you check the Proceeding of First CLISP,
you will see several Blackboard Systems in the C-CLIPS system.

The term "blackboard architecture," like "object-oriented," has become
almost content free.  There are a number of historical technical aspects
to a blackboard architecture, but a number of diverse applications and
architectures have used the term to weaken its precision.  The agent
interaction metaphor often used to convey the notion of the blackboard
paradigm can also be blamed for adding to the confusion.  (The earliest
blackboard systems, Hearsay-II, HASP, etc., don't really operate like
the metaphor.)  The bottom line, is that there are blackboard systems
and there are blackboard systems, and you'd be advised to look beyond
the keyword description to see what is really in the architecture.
(Some blackboard systems would be better classified as partitioned
rule-based systems, hierarchical rule-based systems, agenda-based frame
systems, communicating modules, etc.)

The standard blackboard system description has three major components:

  Knowledge sources (KSs) -- independent modules that contain the
knowledge needed to solve the problem.  In general, KSs can be widely
diverse in representation and inference techniques.

  The blackboard -- a global database containing input data, partial
solutions, and other data that are in various problem-solving states.

  A control component -- makes runtime decisions about the course of
problem solving and the expenditure of problem-solving resources.  The
control component is separate from the individual KSs.  In some
blackboard systems, the control component itself is implemented using a
blackboard approach (involving control KSs and blackboard areas devoted
to control).

Unlike the interacting agent metaphor, KSs are NOT the active agents in
a blackboard system.  Instead, KS activations (sometimes called KS
instances or KSARs) are the active entities competing for execution
resources.  A KS activation is the combination of the KS knowledge and a
specific triggering context.  The distinction between KSs and KS
activations is important in applications where numerous events trigger
the same KS.  In such cases, control decisions involve choosing among
particular applications of the same KS knowledge (focusing on the
appropriate data context), rather than among different KSs (focusing on
the appropriate knowledge to apply).  KSs are static repositories of
knowledge, KS activations are the active processes, created as needed
during problem solving.

KS activations (KSAs) provide significant control flexibility, but
introduce complexities in the implementation of KSs.  Basically, a KS
must be serially reusable, in the sense that it should not matter if
KSA-1 of a KS runs before or after KSA-2 (modifications to the
blackboard or external world excepted).  For a rule-based KS, this means
any local assertions made when executing KSA-1 should disappear when
executing KSA-2.  Since both KSAs may exist (one being executed, the
other on the agenda), shared RETE networks have to be carefully handled.

A second issue with a rule-based KS is avoiding the cost of blackboard
modifications to KSAs that are never executed.  For control flexibility
it is often useful to generate a number of KSAs competing for the
problem-solving focus via the agenda.  (Note that scheduling in a
blackboard system is not simply an artifact of a limited number of
processors, scheduling also involves choosing the course of problem
solving.) If blackboard changes are propagated through the RETE networks
of all activated KSs, the cost of blackboard modifications can grow
substantially.

Similarly, studies have shown that a RETE-network approach to KS
triggering in general blackboard applications is overly expensive due to
the large number of partially matched patterns (each corresponding to a
potential KSA that may never be activated).  Systems such as BB_CLIPS
have these overhead issues when used in large-scale applications.
Whether the overhead is excessive depends on the details of KSs, rules,
and assertions in your application.

>        . . .           (Instead of buying GBB which is in LISP and
>incredibly expensive.)

Expensive is relative, but GBB academic pricing is $1-2.6K depending on
platform.  Not free, but I've watched departments burn up an RA for a
semester or two hacking custom blackboard infrastructure for a single
application.

Also note that the UMass GBB system (the research system that eventually
lead to the development of the commercial GBB product) remains available
via FTP from dime.cs.umass.edu.

Since the early days of the UMass GBB research project, I've received
numerous requests to Email the file containing the UMass GBB system.
Upon hearing that the sources were over 1MB, some inquirers wondered why
it could be so big (how big are the CLIPS sources?).

When I wrote the article on Blackboard Systems for AI Expert, I added an
appendix (placed on their BBS) containing a simple BB-like system (SBB)
written in Common Lisp that was more in keeping with the expectations of
some inquirers.  (SBB has KSs, a blackboard structure, and an agenda.)
If anyone wants this file, let me know (cork@cs.umass.edu).

>	Also, GEST is an BBA and I do not realy know which language
>they have used to developed.

GEST is written in Lisp.

Finally, a language-biased comment about a why there are not blackboard
frameworks written in C.  Providing the flexible blackboard machinery
used in advanced blackboard systems like GBB requires a language with
extensible syntax and control structures.  I'd certainly not like to
work using a "language" implemented via a preprocessor.

                               MAAMAW 93
			       ---------
                      Fifth European Workshop on
            Modelling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World

                           August, 24-27 1993
                         Neuchatel, Switzerland

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Purpose:
The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multiagent systems. MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies. While classical DAI research was mainly concerned
with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view of a common
goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several autonomous
agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and abilities, share a
common environment and pursue either shared or competing goals. MAAMAW
is therefore interested both in classical DAI problems (coordination,
communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.)  and in theories of
intention and action, or, more generally, in the autonomous agent and
multiagent system architectures. Multiagent models are a new area of
research in rapid growth, of relevant interest both for AI and for
social and management sciences. Both novel theoretical and computational
approaches to multiagent topics hae been encouraged.  The submitted
papers have undergone a strict selection. It is an international
workshop to discuss your ideas or exhibit your systems.

Multiagent Olympics:
There will be a competition and a prize for the most interesting
multiagent system (software, hardware). People willing to present a
system must contact in advance the local organizers (see the
registration form).

This Symposium is intented to provide an international forum for
presentation and discussion of concepts and application of artificial
intelligence techniques in the design, implementation, testing,
supervision, and monitoring of real time control systems.  The previous
Symposium was held in Delft (1992), and was the first symposium after
three succesful workshops in the same field.

The objective of the Symposium is to bring toghether control systems
specialists, artificial intelligence specialists and end-users. The main
topics covered in the Symposium are:

      - Real time expert systems shells 
      - Knowledge representation  
      - Intelligent control systems applications 
      - Fuzzy control  
      - Neural networks control 
      - Process monitoring and supervision  
      - Temporal reasoning in process control
      - Intelligent components architecture  
      - Real-time distributed A.I. architectures
      - Human interaction 
      - Multi-sensor fusion  
      - Fault detection and emergency control
