Subject: ICICIS

		Preliminary call for papers
First International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative
		    Information Systems
			 (ICICIS) 

			 May 1993
		Rotterdam, The Netherlands

Aims of the Conference:
Purpose of the International Conference on Intelligent & Cooperative
Information Systems (ICICIS) is to provide the forum within which both
the AI and DB research communities can come to understand the
intricacies of intelligent cooperative work.  The existence of this
forum would contribute towards the evolution of Intelligent Cooperative
Information Systems (ICIS), thereby leading to its appreciation by the
wider computer science community and its integration into the next
generation of information systems.

ICICIS addresses a two-sided problem: how can the information system
technology of the future benefit from AI, and what can information
technology offer to contemporary and future AI systems.  ICIS represents
the broad area where the fields of information systems (in particular,
data/knowledge representation and modeling and distributed databases)
and distributed AI systems overlap.  Specifically, the conference will
provide a platform for the exchange of ideas and for the identification
of the potential roles and nature of the emerging notion of ICIS.  It
will examine a wide spectrum of issues related to interdisciplinary
research and development in ICIS and will help assess the
state-of-the-art and future prospects of ICIS.

ICICIS solicits papers describing original ideas and new results on the
foundations and role of intelligent and cooperative information systems.
Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

o Novel Architectures for ICIS,
o Advanced Modeling and Reasoning Techniques for
  Intelligent Information Processing,
o Knowledge Engineering Techniques in ICIS,
o Higher Level Descriptive Programming Languages for ICIS,
o Data/Knowledge Representation and Management Techniques for
  Coordinating Multiple Cooperating Agents, 
o Interoperability Issues in Distributed, Heterogeneous Knowledge
  Bases, 
o Techniques for Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving,
o Techniques for Partitioning and Composing Data and Knowledge,
o Effective Techniques for Cooperative Problem Solving,
o Active Decision Support Systems,
o Cooperative User Interfaces for Problem Solving and Effective
  Decision Making. 
o Transaction Scheduling Models for Cooperative Information Systems.

The Conference welcomes methodology oriented, practical contributions,
solid theoretical results, and empirical studies that are expected to
have a potential impact on the emerging field of ICIS.

Author Information
Contributions should be submitted to the corresponding Chairman in a
double-spaced format, not exceeding the length of 5000 words.

Subject: ECSCW '91 Review

Nigel Seel BNR Europe Limited, London Road, Harlow, Essex CM17 9NA.
U.K.  email: nrs@bnr.co.uk

The 2nd European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW) took place between Wednesday and Friday, 24-27 September, 1991 at
the Trippenhuis, Amsterdam. The main conference was preceded on the
Tuesday by workshops, also held at the Trippenhuis. Three workshops took
place: "CSCW and AI", "Developing Open CSCW Systems" and "Observational
Studies of Programmers and Organisational Programming".

I understand that all the workshops were a success, but as I organised
the "CSCW and AI" workshop, I was unable to get first-hand knowledge of
the other two, and just report here on the first.

The Workshop on CSCW and AI
---------------------------

This was organised to consider "how AI ideas and technologies could be
applied in the CSCW domain, and conversely, how CSCW concerns for
systems which aid, rather than replace people, could feed back into the
technical agenda of AI research".

Nigel Seel (BNR Europe Limited) introduced the workshop by considering
the two directions separately.  He argued that AI could contribute :

(i)     a collection of technologies (e.g. knowledge representation
techniques, inferencing);

(ii)    technologies for embedded taskable agents (cf. Information Lens
-  Malone et al, 1987);

(iii)   agents in the human-computer interface (such as the Surrey
University Advisor system - Gilbert et al, 1990).

Conversely, CSCW could provide for AI:

(i)     a more situated view of human agency drawn from
ethnomethodology, activity theories, and the like;

(ii)    an explicitly social setting for artificial agents, to
complement the nonsocial naturalistic settings currently  explored by
agent theorists (cf. artificial insects -         Beer et al, 1990,
Creatures - Brooks, 1991).

Steve Scrivener (Loughborough), representing the CSCW camp, argued
against the gratuitous introduction of AI technology.  He felt that
providing a medium through which people could express their required
practices was the main objective, and he looked more to Virtual Reality
than AI to achieve this.  Mike Sharples (Sussex) responded that some
CSCW systems used AI techniques such as temporal reasoning precisely to
create a more adequate environment for 'breakdown-free' practice.

The discussion ranged widely after this, covering areas such as:

- whether the chequered history of AI holds any lessons for CSCW
researchers (AI history allegedly including foibles such as an emphasis
on toy problems, reinventing wheels, looking only under the light,
evaluating systems only on the basis of the design assumptions);

- the distinction between the platonic tradition, in which dialogue is
considered as a means to the discovery of truth, versus the sophist
tradition, in which conversation, as rhetoric, is seen as a means to
achieve consensus. The sophist tradition has typically had a bad press,
has been ignored in AI and is coming to be ignored in CSCW. But perhaps
it is the right place to be. In arguing this point, Mike Sharples put up
a list of what he called 'dichotomies' to illustrate the two approaches

        expertise		consensus
        goal-directed		discursive
        problem-solving		negotiation
        knowledge		opinion
        abstraction		engagement
        knowledge transfer	move to consensus
        logic			rhetoric

John Bowers (Manchester) outlined how the sophist tradition was
currently being reexamined in social science, and drew links with the
'fight against neorationalism' (cf Winograd and Flores, 1986).

At the end of the workshop, there was a general feeling that the
foundational questions of conceptualising human agency as a social
phenomenon were common concerns to both AI and CSCW researchers,
although their 'deliverables' might be different. It is to be hoped that
a second such workshop can be organised at the CSCW '92 conference in
November, 1992 at Toronto, Canada.

---------------------------------------------------------

The Conference 
--------------

The conference overall was generally considered a great success. The
one-track format ensured a cohesive environment, and a steady sense of
progress during the three days. The number attending, about 200, again
provided the right kind of manageable community.

The papers, and therefore topics of discussion, can be grouped (rather
impressionistically) into five categories: Theory of CSCW, Shared Window
systems, Design, Confessions and EuroPARC.

Theory of CSCW 
--------------

Rather good papers by Kjeld Schmidt, Dan Shapiro and Kari Kuuti each
attempted to apply elements of modern sociological theory to attempt to
identify what constituted the discipline of 'CSCW', and to analyse with
care the technical apparatus needed to determine what exactly is
happening when people interact with each other in the constitution of an
organisation. The belief of non-sociologists that this is 'obvious', and
the terrible consequences thereof, are somewhat indicated in the topic
'Confessions' below.

One system which relies on a theory of social interaction is the
'Coordinator' (Winograd and Flores, 1986). It has become a cliche that
CSCW conferences provide an opportunity for collective 'Coordinator
bashing', following the widespread reports of field trials of the
system, in which users are alleged to have found the system coercive,
and as a consequence to have given up using it.

The problem appears to lie not in the general approach of Winograd and
Flores, but in the use of an inappropriate theory - Speech Act theory -
in the context of organisational analysis.  A paper by Dietz and
Widdershoven (University of Limburg, the Netherlands), attempted to
remedy this by making some fine distinctions in the 'Conversations for
Action' model, due to Habermas.

My personal feeling is that it is time we stopped misusing speech act
theory. It is a good (as far as it goes) conceptual analysis of what is
logically involved in acting linguistically. It is not a performance
theory of conversation - this was demonstrated by Levinson in (Levinson
1981). Neither is it an adequate theory of organisational activity, as
the large literature on the subject indicates (eg Silverman, 1970;
Giddens, 1984). Someone should write a definitive critique.

Shared Window systems 
---------------------

A shared window system is an application environment running on two or
more workstations distributed across a LAN or WAN and providing the
following kinds of facilities. A voice link between all the cooperating
group of users + one or more shared windows, so that items moved into
the shared windows can be seen and perhaps manipulated by a subset of
the cooperating group (normally all of them) + some extra screen
furniture to facilitate management of the group interaction + possibly
video and other multimedia facilities.

There were something like five shared window system projects presented
at the conference, plus others represented by delegates. There appears
to be a trend towards being more mindful of the actual social protocols
which people adopt (eg turn taking, entering or leaving gatherings,
topic introduction, repair, making references), all of which have been
the subject of careful study by the Conversation Analysts (eg Heritage,
1989; Levinson, 1983; Luff et al, 1990). Having said that, some systems
were very technology-oriented (Lu, Ishii) whilst others were explicitly
motivated by results from Conversation Analysis (Jirotka).

The conference provided an opportunity for the designers of
shared-window systems to get together, and a loose association has been
set up, to exchange papers and opinions, and to prepare a focussed
workshop at CSCW'92. The coordinator is Saul Greenberg, and for more
information he can be emailed at saul@cpsc.ucalgary.ca.

Design 
------

A paper by Green, Owen and Pain (Sheffield) on the experiences of
introducing a new municipal library system in a 'Northern City' reminded
us that new technology opens up a struggle between many interest groups
(accountants, employers, equipment suppliers). The final users of the
system (librarians and members of the public) may be the least powerful
voices on this terrain.

Christian Heath (Surrey) continued the London Underground Controllers
Saga. The new technology has now been introduced, and the expected
problems of context-loss are being observed. We await with interest how
the insights of ethnomethodology can be applied in the further design
process ...

Robinson and Bannon, in their jointly-given paper "Questioning
Representations", described the process by which descriptions of the
designer's reality at one stage of the design process become objectified
resources for the constructions of new descriptions at subsequent design
stages, leading to 'ontological drift'. There was some discussion as to
how useful it was to redescribe a rather well-known phenomenon in this
way. I think it rather depends on what further use can be made of these
concepts.

Confessions
-----------

Both Tom Rodden (Lancaster) and Thomas Kreifelds (GMD) positioned
themselves as fairly orthodox computer scientists, confronting the new
realities of developing software aimed at groups of people working in an
organisational context.

In Kreifelds' case, they had been working on a Petri Net-based activity
coordination model, called DOMINO, for a number of years. The system was
based on a respectable computer-science theory of concurrent processing
(ie Petri Nets) and this was assumed to apply unproblematically to human
behaviour. The presentation was an account of their experiences in
trialling the system at GMD for supporting an equipment purchasing
procedure.

In a manner reminiscent of Coordinator, they found that people in
organisations do considerably more than follow rather coarse-grained
formal procedures (the paper outlines this in some detail), hence their
system is not an unqualified success. Many people in CSCW will hardly be
surprised by this - in a sense, the whole area of CSCW is a response to
engineering failure. A recognition that the old ways of designing
systems do not work for the new class of organisationally-pervasive
group-support systems.

It seems to me that three kinds of conclusions are being drawn from
this.  Thomas Kreifelds seems to respond in a classically
computer-science way:  emphasising the need for better requirements
studies, a rapid-prototyping model of systems development, much more
extensive testing.

Tom Rodden, in his talk, was more radical. He suggests a model of
interdisciplinarity. The enlightened computer scientist realises that
the sociologists have a valid contribution to make. There is still an
additive flavour about this, however. Still a cosy sense in which the
traditional roles are reaffirmed, even though we talk to new types of
people.

I would be more radical still. The old-style computer-scientist, who
takes in pre-given requirements and produces systems, is finished in
CSCW - rapid prototyping or not. The new CSCW systems
designer/researcher has to be social-science literate, has to
conceptualise the group situation and the consequences of system
introduction in an informed manner. Just as Systems Analysts have to
master business practices as well as computer technology, so the CSCW
researcher will be expected to know about ethnomethodology (cf
Garfinkel, 1984), or structuration theory (Giddens, 1984) as well as
WAN's, LAN's, 'X' and UNIX. Note that this is not to say that computer
scientists have to be social science researchers (or vice versa).

EuroPARC 
--------

There were three papers from Rank Xerox EuroPARC, all reporting on
aspects of the Activity-based Information Retrieval (AIR) programme.
The EuroPARC office is heavily equipped with video tunnels, sound
generators in offices and 'active badges', worn by lab personnel, which
can be location- sensed by the in-house computer system.

The effect must be rather like 'living inside a computer system'. The
system is somewhat aware of the location of all badge holders,
monitoring and logging their positions. It is able to apply some
heuristics to these logs so as to retrieve high-level descriptions of
the inhabitants' activities such as formal and informal meetings.  These
are mailed to people everyday (for the preceding day) - and that is the
PEPYS system, described by William Newman.

Another facility maintained by the building/computer system is
maintaining an event-log. If it was raining outside (physical event), I
might hear raindrop sounds synthesised in my office. If someone used the
office-to-office video- connect to glance at me, I might hear the sound
of a door creaking. When it's time for tea, I hear a kettle whistling
sound. Events can be added to the log by staff in a straightforward way.
This is the Khronika/EAR system, described by Lennart Lovstrand and Bill
Gaver (in two separate talks).

What is one to make of this? In a worst-case analysis, it seems that
privacy has been abolished, while a cacophony of sounds and
interruptions make sustained work impossible. And are any of these
applications actually useful?

There are important social-control implications to the EuroPARC work,
and these were not well-fielded by the staff. Nevertheless, the types of
systems being explored here are going to happen as the networks become
more pervasive, buildings become more intelligent, and multimedia
systems get cheaper. The difficult thing is to find the right levels of
enhanced functionality as the technologies mature and come into use; to
find the kind of computer/network environment which is useful,
non-threatening etc. In this perspective, the work at EuroPARC is
essential, although one may be sceptical about the utility of the
functionalities reported here. Perhaps the EuroPARC system should be a
little smarter, more agent-based and more conversational, and a little
less intrusive.

Conclusions 
-----------

This was a good conference, bringing together a number of committed and
enthusiastic people to construct an 'ideas-rich' environment. I
especially liked the feeling that the conference was a learning
experience, and that progress seems to have been made during its course.

Shared-window systems seem to be popular, effective and varied. The work
in Conversation Analysis provides an extensive and sophisticated
resource for designers in this field, and there is plenty of evidence
that design teams are becoming familiar with it.

For so-called 'asynchronous systems', better described as
process-support systems, the situation is much less active at the
moment. The first generation of such systems: Coordinator, Domino etc
have encountered well-publicised difficulties in the field. However, the
process of bringing together sociologists, interested in how people
constitute organisations, and systems designers, interested in how
computer/telecommunications technologies can mediate such processes, is
well under way. It is to be hoped that some synthesis of these concerns
may result, leading to the design of a next generation of more effective
process support systems (or a proof that this is impossible!).

These prospects should make ECSCW93 in Milan a very interesting
occasion.

Subject: Cooperation between DAI and DCS
Date: 28 Jan 92 14:33:01 GMT
Organization: IRIT-UPS, Toulouse FRANCE

 Hello,

   I'm just beginning a thesis in Distributing Computing Systems.

   Our research team tries to really distribute an operational
multiagent system in collaboration with researchers in Distributed
Artificial Intelligence.

   We want to use DAI techniques for distributing these kind of systems
in an 'intelligent' manner. In fact, we would like that DAI and DCS
become complementary domains.

   I'm looking for anything dealing with such a cooperation between
these two domains (references of papers and books, researchers' e-mail,
contacts with persons .... ).

   Could you send me information about this subject by E-mail?

   Thank you for your help.

CALL FOR PAPERS

WORKSHOP ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN CONCURRENT ENGINEERING

in conjunction with

SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN DESIGN

22-25 June 1992,
Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA.

This workshop, which will be held in conjunction with the 2nd Intn'l
Conf. on AI in Design, is intended to provide a forum for discussion
among researchers and engineers who are interested in the use of
Artificial Intelligence techniques to develop on-line design advisors
for Concurrent Engineering.  It is also intended to help establish the
foundation for a world-wide ``network of excellence'' amongst research
groups who are working in this field. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to,
        Computational Models of CE,
        Distributed AI in CE,
        Modeling (of Products, Processes and/or Enterprises),
        Negotiation in CE,
        Human Interface Factors.
Three kinds of position statement are invited:
        descriptions of perceived obstacles to CE,
        presentations of new research and
        survey analyses of relevant work.

ATTENDANCE: The aim is to facilitate lively discussion among
participants so no more than 10 position statements will be accepted and
attendance will be limited to authors of the statements. Multiple
authors per position statement will be allowed to attend, up to a
maximum attendance of thirty.  The workshop registration fee, to be paid
by all participants, is \$50.  All participants must also register for
the main conference.

FORMAT: The workshop will occupy a half day. Seating in the meeting-room
will be arranged in a circular fashion, as all attendees will be
expected to be active contributors to the discussion. Preprints of all
selected position statements will be distributed to all participants
several weeks before the workshop. Participants will not present their
own position statements at the workshop; instead, to instigate some
lively and controversial discussion, the organising committee will
assign to participants the task of paraphrasing and reviewing the
position statement of other participants. These assignments will be made
several weeks before the workshop and participants will be encouraged to
contact their ``neighbours'' and initiate the discussion before the
workshop. After the workshop, selected participants will be invited to
submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the
International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Engineering.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Send one copy of a short position statement --
no submission should be longer than six pages in length. Submissions may
be in in hard copy, but email submissions of standard LaTeX or pure
ASCII files is preferred. All submissions, email or hard copy, must
arrive by April 27.  Authors of selected submissions will be notified by
May 15. Camera-ready versions of the selected position statements are
due by May 30; beyond this date, they may not be published in the
workshop preprints.
