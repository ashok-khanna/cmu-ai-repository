		Modeling Autonomous Agents in Multi-Agent Worlds

	       5-8 August 1991, DFKI, Kaiserslautern, Germany

PURPOSE

The purpose of the Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of 
research in the multi-agent area.  A multi-agent system consists of 
at least two agents who are engaged in some tasks which may require 
coordination, cooperation and/or competition.  An autonomous agent has
its own goals, capabilities and knowledge. The actions of an agent 
occur in the context of other agents that may have structures and 
strategies different from the agent's own.  Multi-agent problems arise 
when several autonomous agents share a common environment. These problems 
may result from limited resources, shared or competing goals, etc. 
While classical Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) was mainly 
concerned with distributed problem solving leading to a common global goal, 
recently DAI and the multi-agent perspective have been moving 
closer together.  However, we emphasize multi-agent systems of all sorts 
from very simple to very complex agents and agent organizations.  

TOPICS

As the area is new and vital we want to encourage novel theoretical and 
practical approaches to the multi-agent area.  The following is a list 
of suggested topics but all other relevant work is welcome.  

  *Agents architectures (high-level, reactive, situated agents)
  *Artificial life from a multi-agent perspective 
  *Cooperation, coordination, and conflict (generation, evolution, resolution)
  *Communication (protocols, linguistic strategies, negotiation approaches) 
  *Distributed multi-agent planning and collaboration 
  *Distributed algorithms for multi-agent interaction 
  *Learning of cooperation and coordination
  *Hardware (robotics, vision, etc.) based on a multi-agent perspective 
  *Multi-Agent Testbeds for simulating multi-agent interactions 
  *Social simulation and formalization of social concepts 
  *Systems and simulations that apply the multi-agent paradigm
  *Formal specification and verification of agents and systems of agents 
  *Conceptual and theoretical foundations of multi-agent systems 

Leading experts of the domain will be invited to give presentations.
Preprints of the proceedings will be available at the workshop. Papers
from the Proceedings will be revised and published as a book.

MULTI-AGENT OLYMPICS

There will be a competition (and possibly a prize) for the most interesting 
multi-agent system (software, hardware).
