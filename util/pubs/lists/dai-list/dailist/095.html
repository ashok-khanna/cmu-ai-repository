       THE BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY OF INTELLIGENT AUTONOMOUS AGENTS

                      1-12 March 1993, Trento, Italy
                           Institute director: 
                         Luc Steels, VUB AI lab
                   Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium

OBJECTIVES

The Advanced Study Institute brings together top-level researchers and
practitioners from the emerging field of intelligent autonomous agents
(e.g., land-based mobile robots or autonomous undersea vehicles) in
order to establish a solid scientific and technological foundation for
the field. The institute will be biased towards the new methodologies
and techniques that have recently been developed in Artificial
Intelligence under the strong influence of biology, including bottom-up
AI research, artificial life, neural networks, and techniques of
emergent functionality. It stresses practical technological know-how as
well as scientific insight into the foundations and the implications for
cognitive science and biology.  Participants have an opportunity to gain
experience in the design and construction of real autonomous robots
capable of performing tasks that require intelligent behavior.

ATTENDANCE

The Advanced Study Institute is in principle intended for the
postdoctoral level although graduate students, particularly in their
final years of the Ph.D. program, may be accepted.  Participants come in
principle from the NATO Alliance countries; however, a certain percentage
of non-NATO nationals may be accepted.  Participants from Turkey, Greece
and Portugal are especially encouraged. In exceptional circumstances,
scholarships are available.  A small number of participants from Central
and Eastern European countries will be accepted and may (in limited
cases) also be eligible for a scholarship.  Only a limited number of
participants (maximum 60) will be accepted to ensure the advantages of a
small-scale gathering.  Early registration gives a higher chance of
acceptance.

The school is held in a castle in the dolomites region (north of Italy).
There is plenty of opportunity for skiing in the area and early March is
an excellent time.

WHAT TO DO TO REGISTER

Since acceptance is limited a screening procedure is necessary.  The
first step is to submit an application. This application should contain:
1. full address, including email or fax if possible, 2. curriculum
vitae, 3. list of publications and if possible copies of major
publications, 4. motivation why you would contribute to the school, 5.
arguments why a scholarship may be justified. This application must be
sent to:

Luc Steels
ASI Agents
University of Brussels (VUB)
AI Laboratory.
Pleinlaan 2. B-1050 Brussels - Belgium.
Fax: 32-2-640 63 26
Tel: 32-2-640 25 35
Email: springschool@arti.vub.ac.be

A first series of decisions will be made on the 1st of December with
notification of acceptance by 15th of December. A second series of
decisions is made by 1st of February with notification by 15th of
February. There will be a stand-by list.

The registration fee for industrial participants is 15.000 Bfr.  There
is no registration fee for academic participants. Every participant
covers their own travel and living expenses. There is a deposit on
chargeable living expenses of 7.500 Bfr. This deposit is nonrefundable
in the case of late cancellation (after 15th February 1993). But will be
deducted against the hotel cost.  The total amount must be paid before
15 February 1993 otherwise there is an automatic cancellation.
Participants are responsible for their own health or accident insurance.

FORMAT

The institute is organised to maximise the transfer of know-how, to
enable the establishment of a network of researchers, and to encourage
the build up of new ideas and theories.  There is a series of invited
lecturers by leading key researchers.  The lectures are of two types.
First there are the main lectures held in the morning. They focus on the
scientific and technological basis of autonomous agents design.  Second
there are background lectures held in the evening. They emphasise the
biological perspective and introduce application areas (underwater,
land, space, micro-scale). Various pannels have been scheduled
throughout the institute.

Apart from the lectures, robot laboratories will be set up at the
institute site where it will be possible to acquire hands on experience
in building and programming physical mobile robots.  Computers and
robots will be available to successfully execute challenging projects.
There is a competition for the most successful robot to be built towards
the end of the project.  Participants will also have the opportunity to
present their own work through posters as well as oral presentations and
discussions.

MAIN LECTURERS

PHYSICAL BASIS Rodney Brooks (MIT AI Lab, Cambridge, Ma)

This lecture series covers the basic technology for building autonomous
agents: sensors and effectors, processors and other hardware, basic
software modules, architectures for programming agents, in particular
the subsumption architecture, the behavior language, typical examples of
programs that implement behaviors like locomotion and obstacle
avoidance. These lectures also introduce the necessary know how to allow
participants to start building their own applications using MIT robots
available at the school.

Rodney Brooks is one of the foremost "bottom up" AI researchers who is
especially known for work on legged vehicles and computer vision.
Brooks leads the MIT mobile robots group.

AUTONOMY Tim Smithers (VUB AI lab, Brussels)

This lecture series covers various mechanisms for establishing autonomy
and self-sufficiency in robots and of measuring their performance. It
uses second generation LEGO vehicles as underlying technology and as
source of examples.  There is particular emphasis on the interaction
between robot morphology and robustness for achieving behaviors. A
design methodology is introduced.  Based on these lectures the
participants will be capable to design and build their own applications
using LEGO vehicle technology.

Tim Smithers has been the leader of the mobile robots group at the
University of Edinburgh (department of AI) and is currently holder of
the Swift AI chair at the VUB AI lab.

INTELLIGENCE Luc Steels (VUB AI lab, Brussels)

This lecture series focuses on how intelligence can be achieved in real
world autonomous agents. What useful representations of the environment
could be constructed and used by physical agents?  Particular emphasis
on analogical representations and symbolic representations which are
tightly linked to subsymbolic structures.  Does an agent need abstract
reasoning in order to plan actions in a dynamically changing world?
Techniques are studied for obtaining emergent behavior and dynamic
action selection. The lectures will be illustrated with various concrete
experiments on robots built at the VUB which will be available for
further experimentation by participants.

Luc Steels is director of the VUB AI lab and known for work on emergent
functionality and the use of analogical representations in autonomous
agents.  He is also an expert in knowledge representation and reasoning.

ADAPTATION Carme Torras (Institute for Cybernetics, Barcelona).

The lecture series reviews neural network techniques for achieving
adaptivity in autonomous agents. Particular emphasis on techniques like
perceptrons, re-enforcement, Kohonen-style self-organising feature maps,
associative memories, classical conditioning. Examples are taken from
the context of real world robots.

Carme Torras is director of the robotics group at the Institute of
Cybernetics of the Polytechnical University of Barcelona and CNRS
fellow. She is an expert in neural networks and their application to
robotics.

EVOLUTION Peter Schuster (Jena, Germany) [tentative]

Techniques from evolution theory that could be used for evolving aspects
of autonomous agents, such as parts of their internal programs or parts
of their morphology.  Overview of genetic algorithms, co-evolution,
evolutionary stable strategies, hypercycles. Background in chaos theory.

Peter Schuster is director of the Molecular Biology Institute in Jena
(Germany). He is well known for his work together with Manfred Eigen on
the origin of life and the evolution of biomolecules. He published
recently a book on determistic chaos.

LEARNING Tom Mitchell (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)

Review of the state of the art in machine learning and opportunities for
using existing techniques in real world autonomous agents: Concept
formation, formulation and use of frame-based representations,
theory-driven learning mechanisms, learning in the context of general
cognitive architectures.

Tom Mitchell is professor at the Carnegie Mellon University. He is
responsible for the learning component in the NASA Mars rover project at
CMU and well known for his work on machine learning, particularly
explanation- based learning.

ADVICE TAKING Leslie Kaelbling (Brown University).

An intelligent autonomous agent should be able to accept instructions or
advice from other agents on what tasks should be achieved.  Techniques
coming from symbolic AI will be reviewed. The problem of programmability
is considered.  New foundations related to situated computation are
introduced.

Leslie Kaelbling is associate professor at Brown University. She is
known for work on the logical foundations of autonomous agents as part
of the staff of SRI and Teleos Institute.

BACKGROUND LECTURES

The background lectures fall in 3 categories: lectures to provide the
biological inspiration and foundation, lectures on applications of
autonomous agents, and lectures on cognitive science/AI implications.
The biological lectures given by renowned biologists will investigate
cross-fertilization between the technology and the biology of autonomous
agents.  The following lectures have been tentatively scheduled:
     - The biology of autonomy. (Francesco Varela. Univ of Paris, France)
     - The biology of behavior. (David McFarland. Oxford, Great Britain)
     - Cooperating insect societies. (Jean-Louis Deneubourg and Simon Goss.
       Univ of Brussels, Belgium)
     - Biological neural networks [to be appointed]
Application lectures cover underwater, land, and space robots as well as
robots on the microscale.  A lecture on the interaction between
cognitive science and autonomous agent research will be given by Rolf
Pfeifer from the University of Zurich.

Subject: UAI-93 Call for Papers

(This conference is not specifically about DAI, but we certainly would
welcome contributions on uncertainty in distributed problem-solving.)

     NINTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

                     July 9-11 1993, Washington DC

                            CALL FOR PAPERS

The ninth annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence is
devoted to methods for reasoning under uncertainty as applied to
problems in artificial intelligence.  The conference's scope covers the
full range of approaches to automated and interactive reasoning and
decision making under uncertainty, including both qualitative and
numeric methods.

We seek papers on fundamental theoretical issues, on computational
techniques for uncertain reasoning, and on the foundations of
alternative paradigms of uncertain reasoning.  Topics of interest
include:

 -  Foundations of uncertainty concepts 
 -  Representations of uncertain knowledge and their semantics
 -  Knowledge acquisition
 -  Construction of uncertainty models from data
 -  Uncertainty in machine learning
 -  Automated planning and decision making under uncertainty
 -  Algorithms for uncertain inference
 -  Pooling of uncertain evidence
 -  Belief updating and inconsistency handling in uncertain knowledge bases 
 -  Explanation and summarization of uncertain information
 -  Control of reasoning and real-time architectures

This year, we hope to attract more contributions that emphasize
real-world applications of uncertain reasoning.  Questions of particular
interest include:
 - Why was it necessary to represent uncertainty in your domain?
 - What kind of uncertainties does your application address?
 - Why did you decide to use your particular uncertainty formalism?
 - What theoretical problems, if any, did you encounter?
 - What practical problems did you encounter?
 - Did users of your system find the results or recommendations useful?
 - Did the introduction of your system lead to improvements in reasoning
    or decision making?
 - What methods were used to validate the effectiveness of the systems?

Papers will be carefully refereed for originality, significance,
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.  Papers may be accepted
for presentation in plenary or poster sessions.  Some key applications
oriented work may be presented both in a plenary session and in a poster
session where more technical details can be discussed.  All accepted
papers will be included in the published proceedings.  Outstanding
student papers may be selected for special distinction.

Five copies of each paper should be sent to one of the Program Co-Chairs
by February 5, 1992.  The first page should include a descriptive title,
the names, addresses, and student status of all authors, a brief
abstract, and salient keywords or other topic indicators.  Acceptance
notices will be sent by March 29, 1992.  Final camera-ready papers,
incorporating reviewers' suggestions, will be due approximately five
weeks later.  There will be an eight-page limit on proceedings papers,
with a few extra pages available for a fee.
