telecommunications systems. Being partial to the DAI community I would
like to see some submissions from its members.  If anyone is interested
please contact me.  My session description and the ICC'93 call for
papers are included below.

ABSTRACT: 

The knowledge-based paradigm has penetrated mainstream computing and has
led to systems and solutions that address many significant business and
technical problems in today's networks.  Expert system techniques and
tools have been sucessfully applied in areas such as component and
network diagnostics and troubleshooting.  This success has paved the way
for a number of developments in the artificial intelligence community,
some with near term application potential, such as case-based reasoning
and connectionist-based control systems, and some with longer term
applicability to telecommunications, such as means-end analysis
(planning), cooperative distributed problem solving, and knowledge
discovery, to name a few.

At the same time we are seeing the emergence of broadband
telecommunication and computing networks with new requirements for
intelligent systems for network control, as well as for operations
management, service creation and delivery, etc.

The conjunction of those requirements and the availability of
knowledge-based technologies that can offer solutions to enable the
evolution of our networks towards integral broadband switching and
transmission with integrated end-to-end network management is the focus
of this session.  We will present six papers that explore current and
next generation knowledge-based applications, systems and architectures
for services, interfaces, network configuration and management, and
operations support areas. The goal of this session will be to cover a
broad range of AI technologies in a context of significant applications
for the evolution towards broadband networks.

Subject: works in pursuit and evasion ?
Date: 30 Jun 92 03:54:14 GMT
Organization: Curtin University of Technology

I am doing research (leading to a Ph.D. thesis) on the subject of
evading one or more opponents in an unstructured environment.  The
objective is to design an intelligent agent capable of exploring the
environment for a purpose of finding a location suitable for concealing
the agent's presence - thus avoiding capture.

I would be interested in finding out about any work done on any aspect
of this problem.  Any references, suggestions, comments on others'
attempts are welcome.

[Huhns:  The most recent works in this area that I am aware of are

of the Eleventh International Workshop on Distributed Artificial
Intelligence, Glen Arbor, MI, February 25-29, 1992, pp. 183-194.
