Subject: Multiagent Manufacturing Applications Census

Colleagues,

On behalf of two research funding organizations, I am conducting a
census of applications of DAI and multiagent systems to manufacturing,
and would like your help in identifying cases.

--"applications" means that I am interested in work that has been
related directly to some manufacturing problem.  The more mature the
application, the better, but going beyond the request recently
circulated by Erceau and Laasri, I am interested in prototypes and
designs as well as fielded systems.

--"DAI and multiagent systems" is to be construed broadly.  Agents of
any level of granularity are of interest.  In addition to multiagent
systems and distributed problem solving, applications of the situated
action paradigm are of particular interest.

--"manufacturing" is also to be construed broadly, and includes product
design, process engineering, and logistics in addition to production.
Both process and discrete industries are of interest.

Responses are welcome either electronically or on paper, and should be
in my hands as soon as possible, but no later than 1 July.  Copies of
publications and working papers are especially useful.  I shall be
classifying the cases I find in two taxonomies: one describing the
manufacturing problems addressed by the cases, the other describing the
particular multiagent or DAI technology used.  By comparing a number of
initiatives in this way, I hope to be able to assess the relative
maturity of applications of different technologies in different areas,
and draw conclusions about engineering issues in mapping technologies to
problems.  The results of the analysis will be used by my sponsors in
formulating research agendas in this area.

Please contact me either with your own work or with recommendations of
the work of others that I should consider.

Thanks!
Van Parunak

Subject: 9th IEEE Conf. on AI for Applications (CAIA-93)

The 9th IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications
(CAIA-93) will be held March 1-5, 1993 at the Disneyworld Hilton in
Orlando, Florida, USA.  CAIA is devoted to advancing the application of
AI techniques to real world problems. Two kinds of papers are
appropriate: case studies of AI applications that solve significant
problems and stimulate the development of useful techniques, and papers
on novel AI techniques and principles that enable more ambitious
real-world applications.  Emphasis at CAIA-93 will be on *new* AI
paradigms that can or have had an impact on applications.  The deadline
for papers and panel/tutorial proposals is August 31, 1992.

Invited speakers will include Patrick Winston (MIT) speaking on
"Learning and Database Mining" and Wendy Lehnert (Univ. of Mass.)
speaking on "What We've Learned from the DARPA Natural Language
Initiative".

For an automatic response containing the full copy of the CAIA-93 call
for papers and additional information, send an email message to
CAIA@CS.UMBC.EDU.

                          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
                          (Workshop at GWAI'92)
                          BONN, 1-2 September 1992

                           LOGIC & CHANGE

Logical approaches to Artificial Intelligence have the advantage of
offering a declarative framework for the representation of knowledge.
On the other hand, Classical Logic, which has been the generally assumed
logical theory in AI during the past decades, was originally conceived
for the static world of mathematics; therefore, it is not equipped to
deal with the notions of ACTION and CHANGE, which are often crucial in
the problems that AI is meant to address.  Many of the criticisms
against the ``logicist'' view of AI find one of their main motivations
in the fact that Classical Logic even rules out the possibility of a
dynamically changing world.

However, recently the AI community has started to consider alternative
logical theories, which are better equipped to cope with the problems
mentioned above.  Among such theories there are Modal Logic, Temporal
Logic, Dynamic Logic, Girard's Linear Logic, Bibel's Linear Proofs, and
Gabbay's Labeled Deductive Systems.

THE WORKSHOP WILL FOCUS ON THE TOPICS OF ACTION AND CHANGE AND THE WAY
LOGIC ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THEM.  SPECIAL CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN
TO LOGICS OR LOGICAL FORMALISMS WHICH NOT ONLY ARE ABLE TO MAKE
STATEMENTS ABOUT ACTIONS AND CHANGES, BUT ADDITIONALLY OFFER A MORE
_EXPLICIT REPRESENTATION_ OF ACTIONS AND CHANGES.

Concerned fields of application are, among others:  Planning, Reactive
Concurrent Systems, Multiagent Worlds, Nonmonotonic Reasoning,
Inheritance with Exceptions, Change and Logic Programming.

A workshop on this topic has already been organised at last year's GWAI
with a large number of international contributions.  This year's
workshop will include the following invited lectures:

Christoph Brzoska (University of Karlsruhe): 
"Temporal Logic Programming based on the CLP paradigm"

Dov Gabbay (Imperial College): 
"Temporal Visas---Skolemizing across Time"

Stephen Hoelldobler (TH Darmstadt):  
"Equational Logic Programming, Action, and Change"

Alberto Martelli (University of Turin): 
"Truth Maintenance Systems and Belief Revision"

Camilla Schwind (University  of  Marseille):  
"Reasoning about Change and Evolution"

abstract (2-3 pages) or a full paper.  Submissions must be sent to:
