Subject: Brief Organizational Results from 12th DAI Workshop
Date: Sun, 23 May 1993 18:47-EDT

Hi,

Distributed AI appears to be one of the few (only?) areas of AI that is
growing.  But to sustain its growth, it needs more exposure, especially
within industry.  In the past there have been meetings geared toward
researchers, but none that attracted practitioners.  As a result, the
attendees at the 12th International Workshop on DAI felt that it was
time to organize a full international conference.  They proposed that it
be held during the week preceding IJCAI-95, at a site near Montreal
(where IJCAI is being held).  The proximity in both time and location to
IJCAI should help to maximize attendance (which I estimate will be over
200).  The expectation was that it will be organized jointly by the
MAAMAW (Europe), CKBS (England), MACC (Japan), and DAI Workshop (North
America) committees.  Susan Conry from Clarkson University was selected
to represent the DAI Workshop committee in this endeavor, tentatively
named the International Joint Conference on Distributed AI.

The attendees also expressed a desire that the small, invitation-only,
research-oriented format of the DAI Workshops be continued.  Therefore,
it was suggested that a short Workshop be held in Seattle just prior to
AAAI-94.

To Mark Klein,

Regarding your query on the DAI-List for prior work in the area of
intelligent workflow management:

A few years ago when I was managing ADS's distributed systems research,
my group wrote at least one report likely to be of interest to you.  An
approximate reference appears below.  One major finding of this effort
was that it was possible to design cost-effective intelligent workflow
approaches that would permit intelligent agents at each node in a
distributed system to negotiate over their workload for a net gain in
performance by proposing trades (e.g., you have better I/O bandwidth or
database access at your node but I have a faster processor, so let's
swap nodes).  This relied on our previous results and technology in
heterogeneous dynamic process migration as a mechanism.  "Cost
effectiveness" was quantitative and was net of (i.e., takes into
account) all overhead costs, including the costs of negotiation,
metalevel reasoning, and process migration.

Another major area treated in that report was intelligent workflow
assignment to heterogeneous processors in a distributed system, and some
specific quantitative guidelines were developed to support the design of
a metascheduler that would select from alternative distributed system
scheduling approaches in real time.  This was a fairly large ($1million)
research effort, and hence there were a few other major results in the
report that may be of interest to you as well.  (One major focus of our
work was on workload (process-level) fault tolerance, for example, which
we achieved in part through our process migration technology overseen by
appropriate metalevel reasoning; I can refer you to several other
reports on our results in this area if it interests you.)

The results were demonstrated for Rome Lab (then RADC).  I don't have a
copy of the report at the moment, but the you should be able to obtain a
copy by contacting the publications office for the C3 Directorate at
Rome Laboratory, Griffiss AFB, NY and requesting it.  The citation is

Cromarty, A., Edwards, T., Grover, M., Kinion, P., O'Reilly, C., and
Railey, M., ``Dynamic Adaptive Resource Management for Real-Time
Distributed Planning.'' Final Report (Vol. I), ADS Technical Report No.
3191-1, April 1990.  (Also published by the U.S. Air Force as a Rome Air
Development Center Technical Report in 1990.)

Due to the nature of the distributed planning application to which we
applied our approach in the report, there may be some distribution
restrictions on the report (e.g., US only), but I imagine that Boeing
should have no trouble obtaining a copy from Rome Lab.

                            BRAA 93
                    CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
 4th Workshop on Belief Representation and Agent Architectures
                  University of Durham  U.K.
                        22-23 July 1993

The BRAA workshop has been running for three consecutive years to allow
researchers to present and discuss their work and current research
problems in a relatively informal setting.  The workshop has had a
typical attendance of 20-30 researchers and the small forum has been
beneficial to encourage discussion and exchange of ideas.  As indicated
by the title, the contributions will be concerned with agent-based
paradigms and associated issues like belief representation.

History of the Workshop

The first Belief Representation and Agent Architectures (BRAA) workshop
was organised by Cambridge University Computer Laboratory and held at
SRI International in Cambridge, 22-23 March 1990.  It was designed as a
closed meeting of about a dozen researchers in the field, not so much as
to present completed work, but to exchange ideas and explore issues with
others.  The framework was one of presentation followed by a
considerable time for discussion.  Subsequently there were two further
open workshops in Cambridge in 1991 and Durham in 1992, with the
intention of organising another workshop in Durham in 1993.

Purpose and Participation

The workshop progressed from the initial closed format to a more open
format where researchers in the field could submit proposals or just
attend.  The intention is still to allow researchers to present
work-in-progress and to encourage discussions and exchange of ideas.
The numbers have grown to about 30, although the intention is not to let
it grow to proportions where informal discussions are stifled through
large numbers.

Although initially the participants were from the UK, participation has
broadened and at the last workshop there were also speakers from
overseas.  There has been a broad cross- section of organisations
represented, such as the Open University, Philips Research Labs, Essex
University, Hewlett Packard, University of Cambridge, STC Technology,
SRI International, Sussex University, Durham University, British
Aerospace, British Telecom, DFKI (Germany), University of Glasgow,
University of Nottingham, QMW London and others.

The workshop should be of interest for the DAI community as well as
those working on belief representation.  It is, however, important to
maintain an informal atmosphere where researchers are given the
opportunity to present current work and to discuss problems rather than
polished solutions and to exchange ideas in an informal setting.

The workshop is organised into slots of about an hour duration, in which
a presentation of 30-40 minutes is followed by a discussion of about 20
minutes.  The discussions will be reported on and included in the
proceedings.

If you are interested in attending (and possibly presenting a talk on
your work for discussion), please write or e-mail us as soon as possible
- time is short.  The cost of the workshop will be 40 pounds which is to
cover hire of facilities, food (lunch and refreshments), proceedings and
administration.

Accommodation should be available at the college where the conference
will be held and costs are from around 30 pounds for bed and breakfast
per night, and details will be forwarded to attendees.

Please send  submissions and  enquiries to  the address  below.
Submissions are acceptable by mail, fax, or e-mail.

Hi all,

I am beginning work on a project on Intelligent Software Agents.  I've
seen reference to the concept in Allan Kay's writings, but, need some
basic pointers to references so that I can begin my research.

Does anyone know of a few good articles or journals to begin with?

Thanks for any help,
Greg Croasdill

Yoav Shoham presents an interesting concept called 'agent-oriented
programming' in the March 1993 issue of Artificial Intelligence.  Agents
have states such as beliefs and obligations, and communicate with each
other in a similar fashion to speech act theory. The concept also covers
a basic notion of time, so that an idea like the following can be
expressed:

       "At time 1, agent A believes that agent B is
        committed to carry out an action at time 2."

I'm also interesting in finding out a bit more about using these sorts
of agents, primarily as a means of modeling some basic interactions
between humans and automated decision support systems.
