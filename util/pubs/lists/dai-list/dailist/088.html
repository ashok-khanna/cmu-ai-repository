                          Call for Papers

      First International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative
                    Information Systems (ICICIS)

                          May 12-14 1993
            Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands

   IN COOPERATION WITH: AAAI, ACM SIGART, IEEE, IFIP DC. 12, NGI

The purpose of the International Conference on Intelligent & Cooperative
Information Systems (ICICIS) is to provide a forum within which both the
AI and DB research communities can come to understand the intricacies of
intelligent cooperative work.  The existence of such a forum will
contribute to the evolution of Intelligent Cooperative Information
Systems (ICIS), thereby leading to its appreciation by the wider
computer science community and its integration into the next generation
of information systems.

ICICIS addresses a two-sided problem: how can the information systems
technology of the future benefit from AI, and what can information
technology offer to contemporary and future AI systems.  ICIS represents
the broad area where the fields of information systems (in particular
data/knowledge representation and modeling in distributed databases) and
distributed AI systems overlap.  Specifically, the conference will
provide a platform for the exchange of ideas and for the identification
of the potential roles and nature of the emerging notion of ICIS, and
will examine a wide spectrum of issues related to interdisciplinary
research and development in ICIS.  It will help assess the
state-of-the-art and future prospects of ICIS.

ICICIS will solicit papers describing original ideas and new results on
the foundations and role of intelligent and cooperative information
systems.

Suggested topics include but are not limited to:

o Novel Architectures for ICIS,
o Advanced Modeling and Reasoning Techniques for Intelligent
Information Processing,
o Knowledge Engineering Techniques in ICIS,
o Higher Level Descriptive Programming Languages for ICIS,
o Data/Knowledge Representation and Management Techniques for
Coordinating Multiple Cooperating Agents,
o Interoperability Issues in Distributed, Heterogeneous Knowledge
Bases,
o Techniques for Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving,
o Techniques for Partitioning and Composing Data and Knowledge,
o Effective Techniques for Cooperative Problem Solving,
o Active Decision Support Systems,
o Cooperative User Interfaces for Problem Solving and Effective
Decision Making,
o Transaction Scheduling Models for Cooperative Information Systems,
o Models for Computer Supported Cooperative Work.

The Conference welcomes methodology oriented, practical contributions,
solid theoretical results, and empirical studies that are expected to
have a potential impact on the emerging field of ICIS.
