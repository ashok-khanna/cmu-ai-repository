"Dynamics of Expectations"

Abstract:

The dynamical behavior of interacting agents that make decisions based
on expectations about the future, along with imperfect knowledge about
the present and the past, is studied within a model that incorporates
transaction costs and discounted payoffs, essential features of any
economic organization.  Long forecasts tend to destabilize the system,
and a phase diagram is obtained that exhibits a sharp boundary
separating stable equilibria from complex dynamics as the horizon length
increases.  The existence of an optimal strategy, in the sense that
profits are maximized and behavior is stable, is also demonstrated.
Rising expectations in time are shown to lead to a crash whereby the
fixed point gives way to wild oscillations.  This behavior is typical of
two types of expectations:  flat ones, and those that follow short term
trends.  It is also shown how a diversity of expectations among the
agents, coupled to reward mechanimsms, can generate overall dynamics
characterized by cyles of almost stable behavior interrupted by sudden
crashes.

			ABSTRACT

What is involved when a group of agents decide to do something
together?  Joint action by a team appears to involve more than just the
union of simultaneous individual actions, even when those actions are
coordinated.  We would not say that there is any teamwork involved in
ordinary automobile traffic, even though the drivers act simultaneously
and are coordinated (one hopes) by the traffic signs and rules of the
road.  But when a group of drivers decide to do something together, such
as driving somewhere as a convoy, it appears that the group acts more
like a single agent with beliefs, goals, and intentions of its own, over
and above the individual ones.

But given that actions are performed by individuals, and that it is
individuals who ultimately have the beliefs and goals that engender
action, what motivates agents to form teams and act together?  In some
cases, the answer is obviously the inherent value in doing something
together, in part because the actions simply cannot be performed alone.
But in many cases, team activity is only one way among many of achieving
the goals of the individuals.  What benefits do agents expect to derive
from their participation in a group effort?

In this paper, we attempt to provide answers to these questions.  In
particular, we argue that a joint activity is one that is performed by
individuals sharing a certain specific mental property, namely that of a
"joint intention."  We show how joint intentions affect and are affected
by beliefs, goals, commitments and intentions of the participants.  A
significant complication arises when one considers that joint intentions
should be subject to similar demands for stability over time as are
individual intentions.  Our attempts to meet this demand are presented.
Regarding the benefits of teamwork, we show that in return for the
overhead involved in participating in a joint activity, an agent expects
to be able to share the load in achieving a goal in a way that is robust
against certain possible failures and misunderstandings.

"Problem Solving by Committee"

Abstract:

It is widely believed that a group of cooperating agents engaged in
problem solving can solve a task faster than either a single agent or
the same group of agents working in isolation from each other.
Nevertheless, little is known about the quantitative improvements that
result from cooperation.  We present a number of experimental results on
constraint satisfaction that both test the predictions of a theory of
cooperative problem solving and provide a quantitative assessment of the
value of cooperation.  These experiments clearly exhibit a universal
improvement in performance that results from cooperation, and suggest an
alternative methodology to existing techniques for solving constraint
satisfaction problems in computer science and distributed artificial
intelligence.

                       CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

       KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION AT SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS
			 AAAI Fall Symposium
			 November 14-17, 1991
			     Asilomar, CA


Research on representing and reasoning about knowledge and action at
analytical levels more aggregated than that of the individual---topics
such as social and organizational foundations of knowledge,
multiple-perspective reasoning, consensus, multiple rationality,
coordination and collaboration, commitment, stable organization,
representing groups and group activity, etc.---is becoming increasingly
important.  Such research influences many fields, including cognitive
science, distributed systems, design, human-computer interaction,
natural language processing, computer-supported cooperative work, basic
AI and distributed AI, social studies of science, and the engineering of
AI systems. This symposium will address a number of relevant
foundational scientific issues, such as:

CONCEPTUAL MODELING: How can agents, knowledge, commitment, etc. be
modeled at the social, the individual, and at integrated levels? Can a
group be a locus of knowing, rather than an individual?  How can groups
model their own activities and influence other groups, even in so-called
"open systems?"

INTEGRATING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES: How do actors reason among multiple
representations?  How can actors deal with conflict in knowledge and
action?  How can actors dynamically construct useful meanings for the
objects and actions that are part of their joint activity?

INTEGRATING SITUATED AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE: How can agents and groups
address the basic tension between local, "situated" knowledge and
action, and the non-local conception of general knowledge and
action-at-a-distance?  How can an actor influence another actor, e.g.
by sending a message, without global semantics or control?

INTEGRATING SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF ANALYSIS: What would a
"middle ground" theory, that integrates both individual agency and
social structure, be like?  (How) can we make middle-ground theories
computational?

COMMON GROUNDS FOR INTERACTION: What are the foundations for mutually
compatible languages, assumptions, and other common bases for
interaction?  How is global or shared knowledge possible? How can agents
"stay out of each others' way?"

METHOD: What are appropriate research methods for addressing these
questions in principled ways? What are the roles and limitation of data
from biological, human, and social studies? What are the roles and
limitations of current formal models and theories?

Prospective participants should contact a symposium committee member for
a more detailed description of goals and issues.  Then they should
submit a 3 to 4 page description of their work, and some indication of
their relevant background. Ideally, presentations would integrate
theoretical perspectives and practical experience, addressing either the
scientific issues in some space of empirical phenomena, or engineering
concerns in applications domains.

Submissions should be sent BY ELECTRONIC MAIL to hovy@isi.edu to arrive
by June 14, 1991 and will be promptly acknowledged.  If electronic mail
is impossible, send four paper copies, clearly marked "AAAI FALL
SYMPOSIUM" to arrive by June 14 to:
