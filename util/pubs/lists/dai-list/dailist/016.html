Subject: Final Reminder for Special Issue on DAI

                             CALL FOR PAPERS

             IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics

            Special issue on DISTRIBUTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

To achieve its goals in realistic, multiagent environments, an
intelligent agent needs knowledge about how to coordinate interactions
so as to cooperate, compete, or simply coexist with others.  Research in
Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) concentrates on understanding
the knowledge and reasoning techniques needed for intelligent
coordination, and on embodying and evaluating this understanding in
computational systems.

In 1981, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE-SMC)
helped define the field of DAI by publishing a special issue that
collected together articles reflecting the seminal ideas in the field.
The 1991 special issue will bring together articles that represent the
current state-of-the-art in DAI a decade later.

The issue will present current DAI research issues and approaches along
four dimensions:

        - formal models for representing and reasoning about intelligent
          agent interactions;

        - implemented computational systems for experimenting with
          practical mechanisms for coordination;

        - cross-disciplinary approaches to DAI drawing on concepts from
          other fields concerned with coordination (sociology,
          management science, psychology, economics, social
          anthropology, etc.); 

        - research issues and experiences in applying DAI technology to
          real-world problems.

Papers should highlight both the general scientific contributions of the
research and its practical significance.  Of particular interest are
papers that emphasize developments in DAI that can be or have been used
to support human organizations and human collaboration.  Other topics of
interest include, but are not limited to: coordination theory;
contracting; distributed control; cooperating knowledge-based systems;
DAI applications; multiagent planning; cooperative distributed problem
solving; agent modeling; game- and decision- theoretic techniques;
negotiation; intelligent communication; and social metaphors.

SUBMISSIONS:

Submit five (5) copies of an original, unpublished paper to the guest
editor by NOVEMBER 15, 1990.  Acceptance notices will be issued by
FEBRUARY 15, 1991, and the deadline for submitting final manuscripts and
accompanying materials will be MARCH 15, 1991.  Publication of the
special issue is tentatively scheduled for September 1991.

Michigan).  The honorary guest editor is B. Chandrasekaran (The Ohio
State University).  Questions regarding the special issue should be
