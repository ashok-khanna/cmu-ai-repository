MAAMAW '92

Fourth European Workshop on
Modeling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World

July, 29-31 1992
S.Martino al Cimino (near Rome), Italy

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multiagent systems.  MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies.  While classical DAI research was mainly
concerned with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view
of a common goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several
autonomous agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and
abilities, share a common environment and pursue either shared or
competing goals. MAAMAW is therefore interested both in classical DAI
problems (coordination, communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.)
and in theories of intention and action, or, more generally, in the
architecture of the autonomous agent. Multiagent models are a new area
of research in rapid growth, of relevant interest both for AI and for
social and management sciences. Both novel theoretical and computational
approaches to multiagent topics are encouraged. The submitted papers
will undergo a strict selection. A 60 people international workshop to
discuss your ideas or exhibit your systems.

MAAMAW '92 is organized by:
IP-CNR - Institute of Psychology of the Italian National Research Council

Subject: Enterprise Integration Modeling Technology

[The following represents an important new application area for DAI -
Huhns]

           AIR FORCE/ESPRIT COOPERATIVE EI MODELING STUDY 
                IS FOCUS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

Cooperative efforts between the United States and European Community
(EC) to develop consensus on enterprise integration (EI) modeling were
highlighted this week at the First International Conference on EI
Modeling Technology (ICEIMT).  The week-long conference featured
discussions and papers from four workshops held since the beginning of
this year in the United States and Europe.  This conference is expected
to launch further U.S. and EC action toward developing cooperative
solutions for enterprise integration.

This effort is a collaborative pursuit by the United State Air Force
(USAF) Manufacturing Technology Directorate and the European Strategic
Programme for Research and Development in Information Technologies for
Computer Integrated Manufacturing (ESPRIT-CIM).  This program is part of
a larger effort organized between the Department of Commerce's National
Institute of Standards and Technology and the EC to sponsor research and
development in areas of information technology in support of CIM.  The
series of workshops and this plenary conference were organized by the
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), on behalf of
the Air Force, and by the AMICE consortium.

The purpose of the ICEIMT is to develop international prenormative
consensus among the world's leading experts and a plan of action on a
set of technical issues; to characterize the various approaches to
enterprise modeling and resolve them to a common set of concepts and
definitions; and to identify problems and gaps in the current
technologies that point to new research.  Each of the four workshops
held in preparation for this conference covered a specific aspect of
enterprise modeling:

Model Integration
Model/Application Namespace
Heterogeneous Execution Environments
Metrics and Methodologies

Reports from the four workshops -- and the 11 working groups organized
during the workshops -- were discussed as part of ICEIMT.  The
conference keynote, "Enterprise Modeling and Its Significance to
Business," was given by David Hill, formerly (retired) in charge of
corporate information for General Motors.  Also included in the
conference were summaries of developments from the U.S. Supplier Working
Group, reports by AMICE on CIMOSA (Computer-Integrated Manufacturing
Open Systems Architecture), and the results of the study by the
Institute of Defense Analyses (IDA) on industrial information
infrastructure.  These results were presented by Robert Winner of IDA's
Computer and Software Engineering Division.

Three special interest groups (SIGs) scheduled on the ICEIMT agenda
will discuss further actions to be taken in the areas of:

Public Infrastructure
Enterprise Coordination 
Future Actions to Promote EI Collaborations

Says Bruce Rasmussen, chief of the Integration Technology Division of
the U.S. Air Force Manufacturing Technology Directorate, "The workshops
and conference have helped us collectively determine a road map for
solutions to our large-scale integration needs.  The Air Force has been
sponsoring projects for more than 20 years that are now seen as building
toward enterprise integration.  At the same time, there have been many
other groups also struggling with problems, each developing its own
approaches.  We felt it was critical to work together, building
international consensus, so that we don't end up with piecemeal
standards.  The efforts of the many groups have helped shape the
foundation for broad-based, cooperative solutions that we envision as an
important step toward helping form a national EI infrastructure."

Willy Van Puymbroeck, project officer of ESPRIT, sees a similar need.
"ESPRIT-CIM consists of numerous, multinational, industry-driven R&D
projects addressing advanced manufacturing and engineering technologies
and applications.  Mechanisms to leverage the potential integration of
the results of these projects need to be explored.  Many of the
companies involved in ESPRIT operate internationally and manufacturing
operations are becoming more and more global.  Enterprise integration
beyond the borders of a single enterprise is of key importance and
should build on international standards.

Approximately 55 companies, universities, consortia and standards
organizations from nine countries participated in the workshops and
the ICEIMT.  Proceedings of the conference will be published by MIT
Press, available this fall.  

GLOSSARY

Enterprise integration -- provides a commercial information
infrastructure that connects people and systems within and across
enterprises, enabling them to develop, manufacture, sell, deliver and
support products and services with unprecedented speed, flexibility,
quality and economy.

EI reference taxonomy -- generally, a taxonomy is the classification of
items into established groups or categories based on their natural
relationship.  For this usage, the EI Reference Taxonomy is an integral
part of the EI infrastructure that provides the basic underlying rules
for building particular EI architectures; it is a standard, documented
classification that provides a common framework for technology, systems
and operations across organizations.  When specific applications are
based on a common taxonomy, they can be more easily integrated.  On the
other hand, applications that are not built with the same underlying
rules cannot be integrated.

Modeling -- the development of a formal model of a complex process or
system.  This model can then be used to determine how the actual
process or system will behave or react under a variety of situations. 

Ontology -- a formal theory about the kinds of things that exist.  In
enterprise modeling, a domain ontology, for example, defines the types
and subtypes of objects within the enterprise to be modeled.

Precompetitive -- before products are established; EI infrastructure
vendors will meet to agree on standards and common architectures prior
to development of products and these agreed-upon standards will, in turn
affect product development.

Prenormative -- EI users discuss how the EI standards and
infrastructures being developed will affect their way of doing business.

              A Workshop on Cooperating Knowledge Based Systems

The UK Special Interest Group on Cooperating Knowledge Based Systems
(CKBS-SIG(UK)) invites you to present a paper in its first workshop to
be held at Keele University from September 24th to 25th 1992.  For the
workshop please submit a single copy of up to 1000 words extended
abstract by August 10th 1992 for consideration. (The abstract should
include a summary of your intended presentation).  The full-papers will
be reviewed again for publication following their presentation at the
workshop.  On September 23rd directly prior to the workshop there will
be a tutorial session on CKBS presented by Dr. D. Steiner (Siemens,
Germany).

In CKBS a number of intelligent computer systems cooperate together to
solve problems that cannot be solved otherwise.  CKBSs may be described
as the next generation of intelligent systems, with a wide range of
industrial application areas, such as air traffic control,
telecommunications network management, distributed sensor networks,
distributed monitoring and fault diagnostics, intelligent manufacturing
systems and so on.

The focus of CKBS is applied multiagent systems where the techniques of
distributed artificial intelligence and distributed databases blend
together to provide good solutions to real world problems.

The first international conference on this theme was the CKBS'90 held at
Keele in October 1990. The conference was considered by the participants
to be a valuable forum for the cross fertilization of ideas in this area
and at their suggestion a special interest group, CKBS-SIG
International, was formed (managed by the DAKE Centre at Keele), in
order to provide a nucleus for further activities in this area. The
CKBS-SIG(UK) is a subgroup of this larger SIG.  Papers and attendance
are welcome from members of CKBS-SIG International and also from other
interested researchers.

The activity committee of the workshop will consist of:
        Prof. S.M. Deen   (Keele University) [Chairman]
        Prof. J. Doran    (University of Essex)
        Mr. D. Griffiths  (British Telecom)
        Dr. P. Kearney    (Sharp Laboratories, Europe)
        Prof. I. Mamdani (Queen Mary and Westfield College, London)

The topics to be considered for the workshop will include, but are not
restricted to,

        Representation  of Beliefs and Experience
        Planning, Cooperation, Coordination and Negotiation
        Coherence and Optimisation
        Communications and Protocols
        Models and Architectures
        Languages and Tools
        Multiagent Prototypes
        Cooperating Data/Knowledge Bases
        Distributed Knowledge bases
        Dynamic Interoperability

This workshop is sponsored by the UK Department of Trade and Industry.
We hope that in spite of the shortness of this notice, you will be able
to submit an abstract, and eventually attend the conference.  Please
note on September 23rd directly prior to the workshop there will be a
tutorial session on CKBS presented by Dr. D. Steiner (Siemens, Germany).
    
     Key date: Abstract (up to 1000 words) by August 10.
