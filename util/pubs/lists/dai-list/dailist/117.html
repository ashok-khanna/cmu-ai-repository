Tutorial SP4 (Sunday, 2 pm - 6 pm, July 11)
Distributed Artificial Intelligence Tools
Edmund H. Durfee, University of Michigan; and Katia P. Sycara, Carnegie 
Mellon University

This tutorial will thoroughly survey problems, techniques and
applications in contemporary DAI, in preparation for building DAI
systems or as background for doing research to advance the state of DAI
practice. Particular emphasis will be given to DAI tools and to
methodologies for building and evaluating DAI systems. Real-world DAI
applications, such as heterogeneous intelligent information systems and
coordinated intelligent vehicles, are only beginning to emerge. We hope,
through this tutorial, to speed this process by introducing DAI
algorithms and paradigms to attendees in practical, rather than only
theoretical, terms.
     Prerequisite Knowledge: The tutorial presumes knowledge of AI at
the level of an introductory course, and familiarity with such general
concepts as object-oriented systems, planning, heuristic search,
knowledge-based systems, reasoning under uncertainty, and so on.
     Edmund H. Durfee received his Ph.D. degree in computer and
information science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He is
currently an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, where his interests
are in distributed AI, planning, blackboard systems, and real-time
problem solving. He is the author of Coordination of Distributed Problem
Solvers, and is also a 1991 recipient of a Presidential Young
Investigator award from the National Science Foundation.
     Katia P. Sycara is a Research Scientist in the School of Computer
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. She is also the Director of the
Laboratory for Enterprise Integration, where she is conducting research
in investigating and integrating decision making across the
manufacturing product life cycle. She received her Ph.D. in Computer
Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, and is area editor for
Group Decision and Negotiation journal.

Subject: Info needed: object/frame/actor language

Hi Everybody,

My research is concentrating on designing a general document recognition
system, using a blackboard/semantic network/distributed agents
architecture (all of this in the same system: how fun!). (This
architecture is inspired of ideas by Douglas Hofstadter and his team at
CRCC, Indiana University.)

For this reason, I'm seeking, if it exists, a language which could be
well adapted to these 3 components. There is need for static as well as
dynamic knowledge representation (conceptual network vs. ~blackboard),
and something like actors or objects able to act asynchronously in a
pseudo-parallel manner, and able to send messages to each other and to
interact through the blackboard.  And more, I'd like a language with
inheritance (possibly multiple), and classes (and possibly
metaclasses)....

So if any of you know of languages that could fit these requirements,
even partially, I'd like them to send me a mail note.

If many people answer and if the topic raises interest, I'll be happy to
post a digest of the replies I hope to get.

All replies and comments are welcome.
Thanks in advance,
