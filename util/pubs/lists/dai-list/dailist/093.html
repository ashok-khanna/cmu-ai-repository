Subject: ICIS'92
From: denise langione <B3LR0001%SMUVM1@vm.cis.smu.edu>

The Annual International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) will
be held December 13-16, 1992 at the Hyatt Regency in Dallas, Texas.

The Conference is focused on research related to the use and management
of information and information technology within organizations.  A
world-wide community of information system scholars and practitioners
will attend.

This year's conference will offer 5 parallel tracks including: 11 paper
sessions; 22 tutorials, panels, and workshops; and 8 sessions on
research-in-progress.  Plenary speakers will be Professor F. Warren
McFarlan of the Harvard Business School, and Les Alberthal, CEO of
Electronic Data Systems.

The theme of ICIS '92 will be: "The Year 2001: An Information Technology
Odyssey."  The conference will look ahead to the potential roles that
Information Technology (IT) can play in business, society, and
education, including the pursuit of quality management and an educated
populace. ICIS '92 provides a forum to explain research that
demonstrates IT's potential contribution to the 21st Century.

                     Call for  Papers
                         NGITS '93

                 The International Workshop on
        Next Generation Information Technologies and Systems
           
                   June 28 - 30, 1993
        Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, ISRAEL

General Information:

A current view in the research community is that next generation
information and systems will be complex, intelligent, cooperative and
will utilize various multimedia technologies.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussing issues
related to the realization of these next generation systems.  These
issues include but are not limited to:

* Architecture of NGITS systems.
* Paradigms for the design and implementation of NGITS (software  
  repositories, application generators, and object orientation).
* Knowledge and data management issues in NGITS.
* Multimedia technologies.
* Intelligent information systems.
* Cooperation and collaboration in NGITS.
* Computer vision and its use in NGITS.
* The user's perspectives: NGITS interfaces.
* Interdisciplinary research required for NGITS.
* Industrial applications of NGITS.
 
We solicit contributions of two types:
* Research papers (extended abstracts limited to 10 double-spaced pages)
* Position papers (about any of the relevant issues).

The workshop will feature paper presentations, discussions, and panels
based on position papers submitted, a "feedback from the industry
perspective" panel, and invited speakers.

All accepted papers will appear in a conference proceedings.  Selected
papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of
Intelligent Information Systems.

Information for Authors:

In order to promote the paperless society, we shall strive to handle the
submission and review processes by electronic mail.  All contributions
should be submitted to:
     ngits@ie.technion.ac.il AND ngits@isr.berkeley.edu  

If you intend to submit a research or position paper, please send an
electronic mail notice of this intention as early as possible, but no
later than November 1, 1992.

Important Dates:

November 1, 1992 : (preferably sooner)  Intention to Submit.
January 24, 1993 : Research and Position Paper Due.
March    5, 1993 : Notification of Acceptance.
