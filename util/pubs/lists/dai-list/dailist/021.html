                        CALL FOR PAPERS
                      The AAAI Workshop on
      Cooperation among Heterogeneous Intelligent Systems
                       to be held at the 
      Ninth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence
 
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are
studying how to enable a heterogeneous collection of independent
intelligent systems to cooperate in solving problems requiring their
combined expertise.  Heterogeneous intelligent systems can differ in
their internal structures, capabilities, and purposes. The workshop
will address issues and techniques for overcoming current limitations,
including limitations in facilitating collaboration among collections
of AI and human problem solvers. It will focus on how to develop tools
for supporting cooperation between heterogeneous intelligent systems
and shells for building cooperative knowledge-based systems.  Among
the workshop's principal topics of interest are:
 
   1. Architectures and frameworks for combining independent AI
      systems to enable them collectively to solve more complex
      problems.
 
   2. Knowledge-level analyses of the components that belong to such
      systems.
 
   3. Formalisms and frameworks for representing this knowledge.
 
   4. Identification of the types of cooperation and negotiation that
      can be achieved by heterogeneous systems.
 
   5. Descriptions of existing cooperative intelligent systems and
      experiences in using these systems. These systems should make
      sophisticated cooperative decisions, rather than blindly 
      exchanging all information through file transfer.
 
   6. Computer environments that facilitate cooperation between people
      of diverse abilities during a problem-solving process.
 
Attendance at the workshop has been limited to 50 people and is
primarily intended for authors of accepted papers.  There may be
additional space available to those who have not submitted a paper but
are interested in the field.  Those parties should submit a one page
request to the address below.  Timetable
 
    o March 1, 1991 3 copies of an extended abstract (5-8 pages) 
      describing unpublished work due at the address below.
 
    o April 26, 1991 Notification letters are mailed to all who 
      submitted papers.
 
    o June 17, 1991 Final draft of papers due.
 
    o July 15, 1991 Workshop is held.

                          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
                  AAAI-91 WORKSHOP ON BLACKBOARD SYSTEMS

DESCRIPTION
The blackboard paradigm is a powerful technique for implementing
applications requiring multilevel reasoning, flexible control, or the
integration of diverse problem solving expertise into a common
framework.

Blackboard applications have moved from the original speech
understanding and signal processing areas to new applications in
model-based diagnosis, network control, intelligent tutoring systems,
the pilot's associate program, dynamic resource allocation, materials
processing, and even weather prediction.  More complex and diverse
applications have become possible with the appearence of stable
university and commercial blackboard frameworks (AGE, BB-1, GBB, ATOME,
etc.). Recent workshops have featured extensions of these frameworks for
plan-based control, real-time, and parallel processing.

The Fifth Workshop on Blackboard Systems, like its predecessors,
provides an informal forum where researchers in blackboard technology
and developers of blackboard-based applications can exchange ideas,
experiences, problems, and inspirations.  The aims of the workshop
include: sharing the latest research results in an informal setting,
informing participants of other researchers working on similar problems
or using similar approaches, and identifying common unsolved research
issues.

TOPICS
Topics of interest for the workshop include:

   - blackboard frameworks, control mechanisms, and techniques
   - real-time, parallel, and distributed blackboard approaches
   - performance measures for blackboard systems and applications
   - integrating dramatically different systems via blackboards
   - user interfaces and explanation facilities for blackboard systems
   - application development and debugging facilities for blackboard
systems 
   - issues in developing blackboard-based applications 
   - novel blackboard-based applications.

Submissions presenting comparison data between blackboard technology and
other AI methodologies or among alternate blackboard-based approaches
are particularly encouraged.


FORMAT
The workshop is one-day long and will take place during AAAI, July
14--20, 1991.  Dan Corkill will present a "state of the art" address to
open the day.  Accepted papers will be grouped into three panels based
on content; each panel will consist of a series of informal paper
presentations followed by a general discussion period.  A member of the
Workshop Committee will chair each panel.  A set of discussion
questions, to be addressed by the presenters and keyed to each panel,
will be distributed beforehand.  An informal proceedings containing
complete versions of accepted papers will be distributed at the
workshop.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION
Workshop invitations will be issued on the basis of extended abstracts
10 pages or less in length.  Graduate students and researchers with
preliminary results are encouraged to participate.  Each extended
abstract will be reviewed by members of the Workshop Committee.  At
most, 2 invitations will be issued for each accepted abstract.  In
keeping with an informal workshop, the total number of invitations will
be limited to 30--35.
