Hello Netters,

Below is my reaction to the message under the title "Task Decomposition
in Multiagent Systems."  Please feel free to comment on it.

========================================================

First, it is rather difficult to make preexisting stand-alone systems
(for the sake of brevity, just call them agents) cooperative.  In order
to do so, we have to develop ANOTHER inference engine dedicated to
cooperation for each agent.  Inputs to this engine must include its view
to the around world and itself (the controlled KBS).  Each agent,
therefore, needs to model itself and its partners in an abstract way.
Normally, but also inevitably, to maintain such models in a dynamically
changing world will cause a large amount of communication, which may
become the bottleneck of the whole system.  One practical way is to
predefine the static information, such as agents' capabilities in each
model, and only exchange the dynamic ones such as state (busy/free),
intentions (plans), etc.

Second, task decomposing is not totally equivalent to task distribution
in essence. One way to decompose the task may bring about several ways
to distribute subtasks if agents have overlapping abilities.
Furthurmore, task decomposing is more dependent on the nature of the
task, while distribution is more related with the other agents' state.
What I am arguing is to predefine all the possible ways of decomposing a
task and INTELLIGENTLY choose one for distribution according to the
current model of the environment.  Actually, I have got good results by
this means.

Thirdly, trying to explicitly map the specific situation to a certain
cooperation type perhaps is impossible, at least is not such a good way
as far as I concerned.  The tricky point here is WHY DO YOU COOPERATE.
If one has a task that cannot be dealt with locally, it must (has no
other choice unless reject the task) try to get a kind agent for help --
this is task-sharing.  On the other hand, if you get some results and
believe (by consulting environment model) they may be useful for me to
improve my own ones, and if you indeed send those good things to me,
then I can say you're trying result-sharing with me.  In brief, studying
the motivations for cooperation is more important, you can then answer
HOW and WHEN to cooperate consequently.

The last aside, I also endorse the point concerning knowledge exchange.
Perhaps we could benefit from the query languages which are widely used
in DBS (???).

With my compliments to you all,
Long Qiegang

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

           Workshop during GWAI'91 (German Conference of AI)
			    Bonn, Germany
			September 18/19, 1991
			   14.30-18.30 p.m.

			    LOGIC & CHANGE
			    ==============

Logical approaches to Artificial Intelligence have the advantage of
offering a declarative framework for the representation of knowledge.
On the other hand, Classical Logic, which has been the generally assumed
logical theory in AI during the past decades, was originally conceived
for the static world of mathematics; therefore, it is not equipped to
deal with the notions of "ACTION" and "CHANGE", which are often crucial
in the problems that AI is meant to address.  Many of the criticisms
against the "logicist" view of AI find one of their main motivations in
the fact that Classical Logic even rules out the possibility of a
dynamically changing world.

However, recently the AI community has started to consider alternative
logical theories, which are better equipped to cope with the problems
mentioned above. Among such theories are Modal Logic, Temporal Logic,
Girard's Linear Logic and Bibel's Linear Proofs.

THE WORKSHOP WILL FOCUS ON THE TOPICS OF ACTION AND CHANGE AND THE WAY
LOGIC ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THEM.  SPECIAL CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN
TO LOGICS OR LOGICAL FORMALISMS WHICH ARE NOT ONLY ABLE TO MAKE
STATEMENTS ABOUT ACTIONS AND CHANGES, BUT ADDITIONALLY OFFER A MORE
explicit representation OF ACTIONS AND CHANGES.


Concerned fields of application are among others: 
Planning, Reactive Concurrent Systems, Multiagent Worlds, Non-Monotonic
Reasoning, Inheritance with Exceptions, Change and Logic Programming.
