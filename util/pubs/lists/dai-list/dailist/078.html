Subject: Request for Code for Contract Net

Dear DAI-List Subscribers:

I have made enquiries to both Randall Davis and Reid Smith in regards to
their implementation of the Contract Net Protocol.  My purpose is to
subject the framework to perform certain experiments like Distributed
Sensing.  However, they no longer possess the original code of the CNET.

Do any of you have or know of any existence of this source code (written
in Interlisp or Lisp)?

Thank you.

	 Supporting Collaborative Work Between Human Experts
	   and Intelligent Cooperative Information Systems

		   A workshop to be held as part of

			       GWAI'92
			Aug. 31 - Sep. 4, 1992
			    Bonn, Germany

An increasingly important area of research is that of Intelligent
Cooperative Information Systems (ICIS), which are characterised by large
numbers of "agents" with significant intelligence distributed over large
computer/communications networks.  In such environments, tasks are
defined by one or more agents, and are executed by groups of problem
solvers acting autonomously, cooperatively, or collaboratively,
depending upon the requirements of the problem under consideration.
This perspective includes the need to efficiently and transparently use
all computing resources (e.g., processing, knowledge, and data) that are
available over a network (cf. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON INTELLIGENT AND
COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS).

Work on ICIS is supported by research in the fields of Distributed /
Federated Databases, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed AI on the
one hand, and in the areas of Office Information Systems, Distributed
Decision Support, and CSCW on the other.  However, with regard to
collaboration between human experts and ICISs, some important
shortcomings must be recognized.  We still lack the capabilities to
effectively support human experts working together with ICISs.  We do
not even clearly know what the requirements are for supporting
interaction of experts with ICISs!  Relevant topics of interest under
consideration are:

  o Explanation facilities helping humans understand network-wide
processes of cooperative problem solving

  o Tools and techniques enabling users to "discover" useful knowledge
provided by remote knowledge based systems

  o Facilities reducing the restrictions arising from the a priori
autonomy (e.g., in design and implementation) of the agents being
integrated in an ICIS

  o Coordination mechanisms discovering / avoiding harmful
interdependencies between the interactions among different (a priori
independent) ICIS users or between a user-ICIS dialog and the
ICIS-internal cooperative problem solving

  o Architectures of (intelligent) human-computer-interfaces to ICIS

On the other hand, investigations are required into limitations that the
special characteristics of ICIS impose upon user-ICIS collaboration.
Some important topics in this area are:

  o Possibilities / limitations of distributed knowledge base updates

  o Control of user access to (parts of) knowledge bases (access rights,
concurrency control)

  o Interfaces to knowledge bases providing remote users / other
software agents with facilities for evaluating the contents of the local
knowledge base (independent from the standard interface to the local
system)

  o Handling / scheduling of a user's dialog with remote knowledge based
systems made necessary by the interactive style of problem solving used
by an agent working on the user's request.


We would like to address the above mentioned issues in a workshop to
take place as part of the "German Workshop on AI'92" (GWAI'92).
Participants of the workshop will present current research in the
relevant areas.  Further, during the workshop we would like the
participants to target a specific problem (to be circulated preceding
the workshop) and analyse it with regard to a view towards its
solutions.  The results of the workshop will then be made available to
the ICIS, AI, and CSCW communities.

Participation to the workshop will be by invitation (based on submission
of papers to the program committee).  Pre-proceedings will be available
at the workshop.  Depending on the quality of submissions, a subsequent
book publication is intended.

Unpublished full papers (up to 5000 words / 10 pages) are invited which
address the topics listed above (related subjects may be addressed as
well).  Theoretical, empirical and applied research will be considered.

Papers are to be submitted by June 15th, 1992 (email preferred).  Each
paper will be considered by at least two referees.  Notification of
acceptance will occur by July 15th.  To be included in the
pre-proceedings, the final version (incorporating reviewer feedback)
should be received by August 15th, 1992.  The workshop will take place
as part of GWAI'92 during August 31 - September 4, 1992 in Bonn,
Germany.

Please note: Workshop attendance also requires registering for GWAI.

Submission of papers as well as any further communications should be
directed to the contact person, Dr. Stefan Kirn.

           Advance information for a new title in the
         ELLIS HORWOOD SERIES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

         ARCHON An Architecture for Multi-Agent Systems
     Editor: Thies Wittig, Atlas Elektronik, Bremen, Germany

This book provides a synthesis of all the diverse strands of work
undertaken by the ESPRIT Project ARCHON.  ARCHON is a large consortium
involving 14 organizations investigating the development of a framework
for cooperation among industrial supervision and control systems for
large and often distributed applications in order to increase efficiency
and reliability.  One application of ARCHON is electricity distribution
and the book describes two demonstration systems of this which are
currently under construction.  This book is timely and up-to-date and
provides an excellent review of this increasingly important field.
