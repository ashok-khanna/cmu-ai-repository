Subject: Talk on Belief Modeling

	     Modeling the Belief State of Observed Agents
			   Anthony S. Maida
		 Center for Advanced Computer Studies
		 University of Southwestern Louisiana
      Presented by the Computer Science Department, Tulane University
                         Thursday, April 23rd
				   
This talk surveys the author's research on modeling the belief state of
observed agents.  An agent is any kind of knowledge-based system that
interacts with the world.  As background, we will discuss ontologies for
belief representation focusing on the syntactic ontology.  We will also
review issues associated with the interactions of belief, equality, and
quantification, highlighting unsolved problems.  We shall call these beq
problems.

We will link beq problems to the author's research on causal
connections.  Causal connections are concerned with the relationship
between the data structures or symbolic structures in an agent's
knowledge base and the external objects these structures represent.  We
show that beq problems occur when an observed agent has existential
misconceptions--that is, misconceptions about the existence of objects.
Existential misconceptions can be detected, classified, and corrected by
modeling the agent's causal connections.  Because of the relationship
between existential misconceptions and beq problems, the latter can be
solved by systematically modeling the agent's causal connections.

This talk will also discuss a hypothesis that explains how one agent may
acquire the ability to model the belief state of a second agent.
Specifically, we propose that an agent who can introspect and reason by
analogy should be able to acquire the ability to model the belief state
of other agents.  The long-term significance of this is that it may not
be necessary to design computer programs specifically to reason about
the belief state of other agents.  If they can introspect and reason by
analogy, then they should be able to acquire this ability on their own.

                           CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
       1993 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES

Sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGART, in cooperation with AAAI and British
HCI Group
                             January 4-7, 1993
  Buena Vista Palace Hotel, Walt Disney World Village, Orlando, Florida

OBJECTIVES

Advances in multidisciplinary research are creating a new generation of
intelligent interfaces that use computers to facilitate the interaction
of people with information, knowledge, tasks and situations. These
interfaces rely on advanced computational techniques and cognitive
science theories to build systems that enhance user performance. Such
systems can help users to accomplish complex tasks by interpreting
ambiguous input, phrasing multimodal output in ways sensitive to users'
abilities and situations, and providing effective advice and assistance.

This new event stems from a prior successful workshop in 1988 on
Architectures for Intelligent Interfaces (sponsored by AAAI/ACM SIGCHI).
The 1993 International Workshop will focus on a diversity of approaches
to human-computer interaction, from those employing advanced
computational techniques to those incorporating cognitive and user
models to amplify human cognitive abilities.

GOAL

The goal of the workshop is to explore ways in which techniques for
knowledge representation, inferencing, modeling, and presentation can
provide the adaptability and reasoning capabilities required for more
intelligent human-computer interaction. We aim to stimulate high quality
discussion amongst participants from different countries and from
disciplines such as cognitive science, human-computer interaction,
computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. The workshop will
bring together researchers and practitioners with an interest in
methods, techniques, tools, and technology for constructing and
evaluating intelligent systems.

FORMAT

The intimate size, single track, and comfortable surroundings make this
workshop an ideal opportunity to exchange research results and
implementation experiences. Attendance will be limited to 100
participants with presentations spread over three days. The format is
split into two and a half days of presentations with one half day of
working sessions, enhanced by three thought-provoking plenary speakers.

SCOPE

Interested participants should submit an original paper for review.
Submissions addressing theory, system building, or evaluation issues are
welcomed.  Papers may address human-computer interaction or artificial
intelligence/computational perspectives on (but not limited to) the
following topics:

--  Intelligent User Interfaces in a diverse range of application areas 
    including tutoring and advisory systems; natural language processing; 
    generation and understanding of nonverbal media; planning and 
    explanation; information retrieval; computer-supported cooperative 
    work, decision support and supervisory control.
--  Interface-Building Tools and Techniques: knowledge-based and user 
    modelling techniques for intelligent interface design, including plan 
    and intent recognition, automatic presentation, explanation, user 
    aiding (aids, critics, tutors), knowledge representation and modeling of 
    users, systems, tasks.
--  Intelligent front-ends to interactive, multimedia, hypermedia, and 
    knowledge-based systems.
--  Adaptive and customisable systems.
--  Intelligent Agents and agent-based interaction.
--  Requirements and architectures for intelligent, cooperative, and 
    multimodal interfaces.
--  Methods for analyzing, designing & evaluating users' needs & 
    performance, intelligent interfaces & systems.

SUBMISSIONS

Papers will be accepted either for presentation as talks or posters.
Authors are encouraged to submit work-in-progress to the poster session
whilst longer papers should highlight both the general scientific
contribution of the research and its practical significance. Six camera-
ready copies of original papers written in English should be submitted,
as long papers (presented as a talk: 8 pages) or as short papers
(interactive poster presentation: 4 pages). Submitted papers must be
unpublished, substantively different from papers currently under review
and must not be submitted elsewhere before notification date. A book,
including revised papers and workshop results, may be published
following the meeting.

Each paper should have a separate cover page containing the title of the 
paper; author(s) and affiliation(s), contact address of main author, phone, 
fax and e-mail address; an abstract (100-200 words) and a list of up to 
five key words or phrases linked to the submission topics describing its 
content. Detailed formatting instructions are available (for an example, 
see the ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, July 1991, pp. 93-96).

Subject: CFP for Workshop on "DAI" at GWAI-92

			  CALL FOR PAPERS
                              Workshop 
              "Distributed Artificial Intelligence" 
  taking place during the German Workshops on Artificial Intelligence
                              GWAI-92
                            31.8.-4.9.92
                            Bonn, Germany

DAI is established as an important area within Artificial Intelligence.
It deals with the theory, specification and implementation of systems of
"agents," their interactions, and their coordination of activities for
achieving common goals or for satisfying individual intentions.

Although research in DAI so far yielded a variety of empirical and
formal concepts, it is still in its infancy. Terms like "agent" and
"cooperation" are at the stage to become specified. Another trend is to
arrive at standards, for instance for agent-architectures and
cooperation primitives.  Workers in the field also realize the lack of
evaluation criteria and systematic engineering methods. Additionally the
very first genuine applications are thought of especially in network
management, manufacturing control and traffic management.  It also is
felt that DAI is not only an area for computer scientists but that it
should be open to other disciplines like social sciences, management
sciences, organizational theories.  By this more emphasis can be put on
treating "agents in a society" instead of "nodes in a net" as it is the
case with conventional distributed processing.

The workshop is meant to cover these trends. It is organized as a half
day event with an introduction and motivation for the workshop, talks,
discussions, and a panel discussion.  We think of short talks (20min
incl. discussion) for progress reports about current research and long
talks (50min incl. discussion) about completed work.

We specially invite contributions which either stress the
interdisciplinary character of DAI or which describe applications to
real life problems.

Papers are to be submitted by July, 1st, 1992. Notification of
acceptance will occur by August, 1st., 1992.  Although, in principle,
participation to the workshop is limited to those whose contributions
were accepted, we would like to make it open to other people interested
in the field. The number of participants is however limited to the size
of the room available.

At present it is not settled, whether the workshop contributions will be
published together with the talks in the main track of the GWAI-92 and
with those of other workshops. In any case, participants will receive
handouts of the talks given at the workshop.

Submission of papers, applications for participation as well as further
communications should be directed to Birgit Burmeister or Kurt
Sundermeyer at
