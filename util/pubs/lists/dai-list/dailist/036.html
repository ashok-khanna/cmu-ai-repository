       Special issue on PLANNING, SCHEDULING, AND CONTROL:
              An AI-Based Integrated Systems View

      Guest Editor: Katia P. Sycara (Carnegie Mellon University)

As knowledge-based planners are applied to complex problems, some of the
classical planning assumptions, such as perfect information about the
world and the results of actions, a static world, and unlimited
resources do not hold.  In particular, resource limitations and time
constraints give rise to the need for efficient scheduling of actions
and resource allocation.  The ability to plan and schedule is not
helpful to a planner unless it can survive in the world in which it is
embedded. In many applications, the environment is dynamic and
unpredictable, information is uncertain and incomplete, and agents may
have to plan under time pressure.  These characteristics give rise to
the need for systems whose control regimes allow for planning and
scheduling under constraints imposed by the environment, react
effectively to unpredictable events, and provide feedback of execution
results. In turn, this feedback could be used to adjust the system's
behavior by potentially modifying scheduling or planning goals.  Thus, a
planning system is required to tightly integrate Planning, Scheduling
and Control (PSC) capabilities.

The IEEE-SMC special issue on PSC will bring together papers describing
research issues and approaches along three dimensions:

*  formal models for representing and reasoning in integrated PSC
   systems

*  implemented computational systems for experimenting with practical
   mechanisms for PSC issues

*  research issues and experiences in applying PSC technology to
   real-world problems.


Papers should highlight both the general scientific contributions of the
research and its practical significance.  Of particular interest are
papers that present integrated PSC approaches and validate these
approaches either analytically or experimentally.  Other topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:  Planning in
Resource-Constrained Situations; Control of Planning under Uncertainty
and Time Pressure; Distributed Multiagent PSC; Task-based Sensing,
Planning, and Control; Reactive Plan/Schedule Management; Architectures
for PSC; Integration of PSC and Learning; Interfacing with Existing
Tools and Databases; Prediction and Simulation in Decision Support
Planning Systems; Applications of Advanced Planning Technology.  Authors
are required to relate their approach to an integrated view of PSC.

Papers should clearly relate their contributions to previous work in the
field.  Papers presenting formal models should provide analysis of
these models and descriptions of the relevance of these models to actual
domains.  Papers presenting software approaches should provide
experimental evaluation of the techniques and clearly explain conceptual
theories underlying these techniques.  Applications-oriented papers
should address the scientific questions that had to be answered in order
to apply PSC concepts to real-world problems.

  SUBMISSIONS:

	 Submit five (5) copies of an original, unpublished paper (not
	 exceeding 20 double-spaced pages in length) to the guest
	 editor by SEPTEMBER 15, 1991.  Acceptance notices will be

	 final manuscripts and accompanying materials is FEBRUARY
	 15, 1992.  Publication of the special issue is tentatively
	 scheduled for JULY 1992.
