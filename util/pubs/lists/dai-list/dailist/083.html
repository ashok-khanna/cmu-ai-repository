			Call for Papers
The 13th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems
	Pittsburgh Hilton, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, 
		Tuesday-Friday, May 25-28, 1993

This conference encompasses the technical aspects of specifying,
designing, implementing, and evaluating distributed computing systems.
In such systems, there are multiple processing resources interconnected
to cooperate under system-wide control with minimal reliance on
centralized procedures, data, or hardware.  The location of computing
resources may span the spectrum from physical adjacency to geographical
dispersion.  The topics of interest include the following aspects of
distributed computing systems.

- Computer Architecture and Distributed Shared Memory
- Cooperative Work and Artificial Intelligence
- Languages, Tools, and Software Engineering
- Distributed System Services and Management
- Communication Architectures and Protocols
- Multimedia Computing and Communication
- Modeling and Performance Evaluation
- Reliability and Fault Tolerance
- Distributed Operating Systems
- Distributed Algorithms
- Distributed Databases
- Real-Time Issues

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS
Authors are requested to submit six copies (in English) of their
double-spaced typed manuscript (maximum of 20 pages) with an abstract
and keywords to Prof. Wittie by Thursday, October 15, 1992.  The
conference language is English and final papers are restricted to eight
IEEE model pages.  Each paper must be accompanied by a submission letter
that indicates which one or two conference areas are most relevant.  If
there are multiple authors, one author must be designated as responsible

Hello,
I'm looking for distributed object oriented languages.
Where can I find a description and an implementation of MACE and/or AGORA?
Any hints? Please e-mail me.

Subject: DAI at KR'92 Conference (Program Excerpts)
Date: 2 Jul 92 20:22:19 GMT

                                    KR'92
                      Third International Conference on
            Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

                             Royal Sonesta Hotel
                        Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

                             October 25-29, 1992

With support from the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the
European Coordinating Committee on Artificial Intelligence, and the Canadian
Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence; in cooperation with
International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, Inc.

                                 ABOUT KR'92

The idea of explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by inference
algorithms provides an important foundation for much work in Artificial
Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems.  A growing number of
researchers are interested in the principles governing systems based on this
idea.  Following the successful formula of the two earlier KR conferences,
KR'92 will bring together these researchers in a more intimate setting than
that of the general AI conferences.  In particular, authors will have the
opportunity to give presentations of adequate length to present substantial
results.  Also, a relatively small conference site has again been selected in
order to encourage informal interaction among attendees.

The theme of this year's conference is the relationship between the
principles of knowledge representation and reasoning and their embodiment in
working systems.  Presented papers and invited talks will address the
following important questions:

* What issues arise in applying knowledge representation systems to
  real problems?
* What are the theoretical principles of knowledge representation
  and reasoning?
* How can these principles be embodied in knowledge representation
  systems?

			  INVITED TALKS AND PANELS

The DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort: Progress Report,
Ramesh Patil (Panel Organizer)-USC/Information Sciences Inst., USA
     This panel will report on the following activities, with special
emphasis on the problems encountered and open research issues: an
interlingua for translation between different representation languages
(Richard Fikes, Stanford U.), a uniform syntax and semantics for common
constructs within representation families (Peter Patel-Schneider, AT&T
Bell Labs), a protocol for run-time interchange between system modules,
(Donald McKay, UNISYS), and libraries of domain-specific ontologies
(Thomas Gruber, Stanford U.).
