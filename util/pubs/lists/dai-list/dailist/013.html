We have a new paper available, entitled "Controlling Chaos in
Distributed Systems",  by T. Hogg and B. A. Huberman of Xerox PARC, Palo
Alto, CA. 94304. The abstract reads as follows:

We describe a simple and robust procedure for freezing out chaotic
behavior in distributed systems when imperfect and delayed information
cannot be avoided.  It is based on a reward mechanism whereby the
relative number of computational agents following effective strategies
is increased at the expense of the others.  This procedure, which
generates a diverse population out of an essentially homogeneous one, is
able to control chaos through a series of dynamical bifurcations into a
stable fixed point.  Stability boundaries are computed and the minimal
amount of diversity required in the system is established.
