Subject: request for info. on coordination

As part of my dissertation we are trying to measure the degree of
coordination (or the lack of it) in business teams.

I was wondering if anyone had developed an instrument or at least scale
items for measuring coordination.

Please reply by EMail to sukumar@emx.utexas.edu.  I will post a summary
of any responses. 

Thanks,
Sukumar
