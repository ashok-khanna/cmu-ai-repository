                         ===============
                       IJCAI-93 Workshop on
            Computational Models of Conflict Management
                 in Cooperative Problem Solving

                     Monday August 30, 1993
                        Chambery, France
Description

A central aspect of cooperative problem solving by groups is the
avoidance, detection, and resolution of conflicts among the
participants. This is of great theoretical interest in such research
areas as distributed artificial intelligence. It is also of considerable
practical importance because of the key role conflict management plays
in cooperative problem solving e.g.  in concurrent engineering. Work on
conflict management has occurred in a variety of settings including
concurrent engineering, multiagent planning & design, AI and Law,
distributed AI (including game theory), GDSS (group decision support
systems), CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work), software
engineering, sociology, organizational science, public policy and
international relations. This work thus includes theoretical groundwork,
empirical studies and implemented conflict management systems for human
and computational agents. Despite wide-spread interest, however, there
have been few opportunities for researchers addressing these issues in
different areas to explore commonalities and benefit from the differing
insights each have achieved. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate
this kind of cross-fertilization process.

The workshop will focus on several key themes:

* What lessons do empirical studies of conflict management have to offer
for the development of computational models?

* What are the current theoretical underpinnings for conflict
management, and how can they be applied to practical problems?

* How can computers support group conflict management with both human
and computational participants? What are the benefits and challenges of
the different approaches?

* What aspects of conflict management are generic and what are
domain-specific? Can the same techniques work with human and
computational participants?

* How do computational models of conflict management fare in real-world
social and organizational settings?

Through exploring such themes it is hoped the participants will have a
better idea about how they can use related work from other areas, and
can begin to outline a single general theory of conflict management that
works across multiple domains.

Workshop Information:

This full day workshop is part of the Workshop Program for IJCAI-93 (the
International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence) and will be
held in Chambery, France on Monday, August 30, 1993.

The workshop will consist of four moderated 75 minute sessions, each
made up of:

* a brief (5-10 minute) moderators' overview of common themes and key
issues

* four 10 minute presentations (including questions): presenters will be
asked to follow a results-oriented format and to address key issues
identified by the moderators.

* a discussion panel wherein presenters field questions from the
audience and each other. This should be focused on shared issues rather
than further explanation of the participant's individual work.

Workshop participants will also be invited to display posters describing
their work.

Please note that each attendee must have registered for the main
conference and is required to pay an additional 300 FF (about $60 US)
fee for the workshop. IJCAI has offered to exempt the workshop fee for
one student attendee if he or she agrees to be in charge of taking notes
for the whole day. Please let me know if you are interested.

Submissions:

Participation is by invitation only, and will be limited to
approximately 35 people of which 16 will be presenters. Those who wish
to attend the workshop should submit four copies of a research abstract
no more than 5 pages long focusing on the main contribution of their
work in preference to general introductory material, literature review
etc. All submissions will be reviewed by researchers working in a
related area. Please include a brief abstract, the author's electronic
and physical address information, and indicate if you would like to
display a poster on your work at the workshop. Electronic submissions
will be accepted only if they are in pure ascii or binhexed Macintosh
Word/MacWrite format.

Submission deadline:		March 1, 1993
Notification date:		April 1, 1993
Final date for revised papers:	June 1, 1993

We expect that revised versions of the best papers from the workshop
will be considered for inclusion in an appropriate journal or published
collection.

(e.g. land-based mobile robots or autonomous undersea vehicles) in order
to establish a solid scientific and technological foundation for the
field. The institute will be biased towards the new methodologies and
techniques that have recently been developed in Artificial Intelligence
under the strong influence of biology, including bottom-up AI research,
artificial life, neural networks, and techniques of emergent
functionality. It stresses practical technological know how as well as
scientific insight into the foundations and the implications for
cognitive science and biology.  Participants have an opportunity to gain
experience in the design and construction of real autonomous robots
capable of performing tasks which require intelligent behavior.

The registration fee for industrial participants is 45.000 Bfr.  There
is no registration fee for academic participants. Every participant
covers their own travel and living expenses. There is a deposit on
chargeable living expenses of 7.500 Bfr. This deposit is non-refundable
in the case of late cancellation (after 15th february 1993). But will be
deducted against the hotel cost.  The total amount must be paid before
15 february 1993 otherwise there is an automatic cancellation.
Participants are responsible for their own health or accident insurance.

Format

Apart from the lectures, robot laboratories will be set up at the
institute site where it will be possible to acquire hands on experience
in building and programming physical mobile robots.  Computers and about
20 robots of different types will be available to successfully execute
challenging projects. There is a competition for the most successful
robot to be built towards the end of the institute.  Participants will
also have the opportunity to present their own work through posters as
well as oral presentations and discussions.

          SPIE SENSOR FUSION VI - Final Call for Papers

September 7-10, 1993
Boston, Massachusetts  
Hynes Convention Center

Chair: Paul S. Schenker, Jet Propulsion Lab.	 
	
The Sensor Fusion conference presents new techniques for robustly
integrating and interpreting data from multiple sources. The main topic
area is automation and robotic systems; such systems often include
multiple-and-moving cameras, range and proximity detctors, force and
touch feedback, etc. A typical system requirement is to use the sensors,
plus prior knowledge, to efficiently locate, identify, and track
objects; more advanced applications may require a detailed inspection
and recognition of the environment, and/or global determination of robot
position and state of task completion. Research challenges include
multisensor registration and calibration, combining sensor information
over space-and-time, 3-D shape modeling and shape recovery, 3-D object
recognition and localization et al. An exciting open problem is how to
intelligently control sensors to achieve a task-specific sensing
objective, in the system operational context of maximizing information
and minimizing computation.  For example, "active vision" addresses how
to direct camera gaze and focus activity, analagous to human viewing.
"Exploratory sensing" expands this paradigm to cooperative fusion of
vision, range, touch, and other sensory modes, and may include the use
of multiple distributed robot agents, e.g., to develop environmental
maps, and perform cooperative work. Collectively, these problems have
foundations in both machine and biological behavior, and both
perspectives are welcome. Another area of fundamental interest is
techniques for distributed detection & decision, as applies to data
fusion in spatially dispersed sensor arrays, decision-making in human
organizations, and command-control-communication within distributed
information networks. In general, the Sensor Fusion conference is
characterized by disciplinary breadth. Speakers of past years include
researchers from applied mathematics, artificial intelligence, computer
science, engineering, psychology, neuroscience, and theoretical biology.
We continue to foster this diversity, encouraging papers that contrast
and compare multidisciplinary approaches to sensor fusion, and/ or
synthesize fresh theoretical viewpoints across disciplines.

In summary, we invite papers on multisensory fusion and its
applications; topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

o  modeling and calibration of multiple sensors
o  3-D object modeling-and-recognition from multiple sensor views
o  recovery of scene structure from time-sequence sensor data
o  fusion of passive-active sources: vision-range, IR-microwave, etc.
o  remote sensing, automated inspection, and target recognition 
o  distributed detection & decision networks and their applications
o  robotic sensor fusion: visual, range, force, tactile, & kinematic data
o  robot control based on multisensor inputs 
o  active vision, task-driven sensing, and sensor planning
o  multiple robot agents and cooperative sensing strategies
o  medical imaging, 3-D stereotaxy & visualization, and surgical aids
o  man-machine systems and fused multisensory operator interfaces
o  novel computing architectures and programming environments
