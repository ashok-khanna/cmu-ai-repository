Subject: Theoretical DAI

*Should* we go for a single type of theory in DAI?  There are so many
different types of things in DAI; offhand I would say the (very) broad
subfields within DAI include, with some overlap, the following:

1. "Frameworks": coordination methods, organizational structures,
   coordination schemes, techniques for problem decomposition &
   distribution, etc.;

2. Planning, with and without the involvement of other agents;

3. Behavioral studies of systems as collections of agents;
   
4. Reasoning about other agents, modeling other agents and the network,
   etc.

Now, as I see it, class 1 is, roughly, an "architectural" issue, in that
researchers construct frameworks for cooperation, interaction protocols,
etc., so we use verbal and graphical descriptions, structured to one
degree or another.  Class 2 is, well, planning, so we get structured
verbal descriptions (in which I include algorithms & heuristics) plus
some calculus.  For class 3 we can go in for theories based on
statistical mechanics & statistics, & theories based on equations and
distributions & real variables, as in macroeconomics.  Class 4 is
basically KR and reasoning, and we end up with game theory or one kind
of logic or another.

Now I may have left out something or the other, & some may disagree with
the above broad classification, but the point is that I do not think we
should expect a common core (beyond the basic definitions), in the sense
of a grand unified theory, or even expect the same type of theory to
work in all subfields.

It may well be possible to model *some* of the above problems
mathematically and end up with descriptions of system behavior based on
variables (real or invented).  I suppose this is the closest we could
come to a common core theory or a G.U.T.

On theories in DAI:

The most useful theories are those that
a) allow you to describe what you observe
b) enable you to predict what happens next.

If we are to synthesize practical DAI systems, then theories should at
least accomplish this.

If theories don't allow us to predict the behaviour of DAI (or even
AI....)  systems, then what hope for seeing them used in practice?
Nobody will commission systems whose performance cannot be measured
against a specification. Remember Hal in 2001 .....

Subject: CFP for IJCAI-93 Conflict Management Workshop

                         Call For Papers
                         ===============
                       IJCAI-93 Workshop on
            Computational Models of Conflict Management
                 in Cooperative Problem Solving

Description

A central aspect of cooperative problem solving by groups is the
avoidance, detection and resolution of conflicts among the participants.
This is of great theoretical interest in such research areas as
distributed artificial intelligence.  It is also of considerable
practical importance because of the key role conflict management plays
in cooperative problem solving, e.g., in concurrent engineering.  Work
on conflict management has occurred in a variety of settings, including
concurrent engineering, multiagent planning & design, AI and Law,
distributed AI (including game theory), GDSS (group decision support
systems), CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work), software
engineering, sociology, organizational science, public policy and
international relations. This work thus includes theoretical groundwork,
empirical studies and implemented conflict management systems for human
and computational agents. Despite widespread interest, however, there
have been few opportunities for researchers addressing these issues in
different areas to explore commonalities and benefit from the differing
insights each have achieved. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate
this kind of cross-fertilization process.

The workshop will focus on several key themes:

* What lessons do empirical studies of conflict management have to offer
for the development of computational models?

* What are the current theoretical underpinnings for conflict
management, and how can they be applied to practical problems?

* How can computers support group conflict management with both human
and computational participants? What are the benefits and challenges of
the different approaches?

* What aspects of conflict management are generic and what are
domain-specific? Can the same techniques work with human and
computational participants?

* How do computational models of conflict management fare in real-world
social and organizational settings?

Through exploring such themes it is hoped the participants will have a
better idea about how they can use related work from other areas, and
can begin to outline a single general theory of conflict management that
works across multiple domains.

Workshop Information

This single-day workshop is part of the Workshop Program for IJCAI-93
(the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence), which
is to be held in Chambery, France between August 29 - September 3, 1993.
The exact workshop date has not been decided yet and will be announced
when it becomes available.

The workshop will consist of four moderated 75 minute sessions, each
made up of:

* a brief (5-10 minute) moderators' overview of common themes and key
issues

* four 10 minute presentations (including questions): presenters will be
asked to follow a results-oriented format and to address key issues
identified by the moderators.

* a discussion panel wherein presenters field questions from the
audience and each other. This should be focused on shared issues rather
than further explanation of the participant's individual work.

Workshop participants are also invited to display posters describing
their work.

Please note that each attendee must have registered for the main
conference and is required to pay an additional 300 FF (about $60 US)
fee for the workshop.  IJCAI has offered to exempt the workshop fee for
one student attendee if he or she agrees to be in charge of taking notes
for the whole day.  Please let me know if you are interested.

Submissions

Participation is by invitation only, and will be limited to
approximately 35 people of whom 16 will be presenters. Those who wish to
attend the workshop should submit four copies of a research abstract no
more than 5 pages long focusing on the main contribution of their work
in preference to general introductory material, literature review, etc.
All submissions will be reviewed by researchers working in a related
area.  Please include a brief abstract, the author's electronic and
physical address information, and indicate if you would like to display
a poster on your work at the workshop.  Electronic submissions will be
accepted only if they are in pure ascii or binhexed Macintosh
Word/MacWrite format.

Submission deadline:		March 1, 1993
Notification date:		April 1, 1993
Final date for revised papers:	June 1, 1993

We expect that revised versions of the best papers from the workshop
will be considered for inclusion in an appropriate journal or published
collection.

I'm looking for information on communication protocols for distributed
expert systems. Are there any de facto standards emerging in this area?
Can anyone recommend any articles or books related to this? Thanks!

Subject: Info wanted: real-time blackboards
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 1992 17:45:36 GMT

We are looking for information on any commercial or public-domain
blackboard architectures that would be appropriate for real-time
signal-processing applications.  This will be used in a fielded system,
not for prototype development.  Also, if anyone has any case studies or
anecdotes about actual experiences with blackboard systems, we would be
interested in hearing about them.
