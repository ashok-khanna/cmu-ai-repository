                              MAAMAW '93

                     Fifth European Workshop on
          Modelling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World

                           August, 25-27 1993
                         Neuchatel, Switzerland

                            CALL FOR PAPERS

The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multiagent systems.  MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies.  While classical DAI research was mainly
concerned with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view
of a common goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several
autonomous agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and
abilities, share a common environment and pursue either shared or
competing goals.  MAAMAW is therefore interested both in classical DAI
problems (coordination, communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.)
and in theories of intention and action, or, more generally, in
autonomous agent and multiagent system architectures.  Multiagent
models are a new area of research in rapid growth, of relevant interest
both for AI and for social and management sciences. Both novel
theoretical and computational approaches to multiagent topics are
encouraged.  The submitted papers will undergo a strict selection. It
is an international workshop to discuss your ideas or exhibit your
systems.

Topics of MAAMAW interest include, but are not limited to:
          * Agent architectures (high level, reactive, situated
            agents, especially integration of these)
          * Artificial life from a multiagent perspective
          * Cooperation, coordination, and conflict
          * Communication (protocols, linguistic strategies,
            negotiation approaches)
          * Distributed planning and group work
          * Distributed algorithms for multiagent interactions
          * Learning of cooperation and coordination
          * Hardware  based on a multiagent perspective
          * Multiagent testbeds for simulating multiagent interactions
          * Formal specification and verification of agents and
            systems of agents
          * Conceptual and theoretical foundations of multiagent systems
          * Social simulation and formalization of social concepts
          * Practical applications of multiagent systems

This year, the workshop will concentrate in two important directions for
the future of the multiagent domain:

    *** EMERGENCE AS A NEW PARADIGM: FROM INTERACTION TO COGNITION ***

The study of "emergence" of functionalities can be used to try bridging
the gap between Brooks-like, reactive systems (an individual as a set
of interacting entities) and cognitive models (an individual as a whole
having knowledge, goals and plans), or between implementational and
theoretical perspectives, or between the micro- and the macrolevels of
social action.  In particular, organizations can be seen as entities
having knowledge, goals and plans which are not explicitly represented
or shared by any individual member but just emerge from the structure
and related interactions of the agents composing the organizations.
Conversely, part of the knowledge, goals and plans of one agent could
be explained by the interaction of the agent with the other agents.

          *** WORKING TOGETHER AS A MULTI-AGENT PROBLEM ***

What is the contribution of DAI models and applications to the design of
modern organizations?  What are its relations with Computer Supported
Cooperative Work? What are the possible contributions of multiagent
systems to the development of Coordination Science?  Papers on the
applications of multiagent systems and their effects on "working
together," of humans and machines, in offices or in factories, with
robots or with databases, are strongly encouraged.

Special focuses concern papers, as well invited talks and debates.
However, papers on the other topics are welcomed. Preprints of the
proceedings will be available at the workshop. Papers from the
proceedings will be revised to appear in a book.

Subject: Paper available on Interaction Abstract Machines
From: Remo Pareschi <Remo.Pareschi@ecrc.de>


The following paper will appear in the book ``Research Directions in
Concurrent Object-oriented Programming'', edited by Agha, Wegner and
Yonezawa.  The paper is available via anonymous ftp at the node
``ecrc.de'' in the directory /pub/loco.

TITLE: Interaction Abstract Machines

AUTHORS: Jean-Marc Andreoli, Paolo Ciancarini and Remo Pareschi

ABSTRACT:

In this paper, we introduce the metaphor of Interaction Abstract
Machines (IAMs), in the same vein of such metaphors as the Chemical
Abstract Machine.  The main point about IAMs is in allowing interactions
among independent, locally defined subsystems --- a crucial requirement
for capturing the global behavior of open systems.  IAMs amalgamate dual
concepts in distributed problem solving, such as blackboards and
broadcast communication, which are exploited to account for,
respectively, the tight integration and the loose integration of system
components.  The formal counterpart for the IAM metaphor can be found in
the computational model of Linear Objects (LO), whose aim is the
abstract modeling of concurrent agent-oriented computations and whose
operational semantics is given in terms of the proof theory of Linear
Logic, a framework recently introduced to provide a theoretical account
for the notion of (inter)action.

               ICLP'93 Postconference Workshop on
               Blackboard-Based Logic Programming

                          June 24, 1993
                        Budapest, Hungary

  Experience with existing logic programming languages has revealed the
need for access to global data in a structured way.  Blackboards have
recently entered logic programming as a promising answer to this need.
Besides the advantages of global storage, blackboards are successfully
used for communication in new parallel languages (e.g., Linda-D-Prolog,
Shared Prolog,...). They have also turned out to be an elegant tool for
integrating independently developed Prolog programs as well as programs
written in vastly different styles, such as functional, object-oriented
and logic programming styles.

  The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in
all aspects of blackboard-based logic programming, including but not
limited to the following topics:

  - Language design (both concurrent and sequential)
  - Theory and foundations
  - Implementations and architectures
  - Compilation techniques
  - Global and persistent objects in logic programming
  - Multiparadigm blackboard programming
  - Applications and programming methodologies.

  Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to send, by
e-mail or by regular mail, a 3-5 page abstract or, preferably, a full
paper before April 1st.  The submissions will be reviewed by the
workshop organizers and based on this review, they will be included in
informal proceedings to be distributed to the attendees. A selection of
these papers will be presented at the workshop. Acceptance/rejection
will be notified by May 1st.

  People interested in attending the workshop are welcome too. They are
kindly requested to send their postal and (if available) electronic
address as soon as possible.

Subject: research on distributed AI??
Date: Wed, 3 Feb 1993 11:45:44 GMT

I'm looking for research work on distributed AI. Does anyone know about
work done in the following areas:

1. Interoperating of multiple (possibly heterogeneous) expert systems.

2. Dealing with inconsistencies among different expert systems, if they
are connected together to give one advice.

Imagine 10 surgeon-expert-systems discussing the best way to fix a
broken leg.

Any hints are welcome (other newsgroup to post, papers, conferences,
books, email addresses of authors, ...)

Please answer via email. I will forward/repost a summary if requested.
