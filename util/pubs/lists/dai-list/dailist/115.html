Subject: sharing of knowledge bases
Date: Fri, 2 Apr 1993 14:15:55 GMT

Hello Colleagues,

I am a Ph.D. student at the university of GRENOBLE-FRANCE. I want to
know if there are other ppeople in this group who are interested in the
management of shared knowledge bases.

In order to build a large scale knowledge base, we find necessary the
development of a basic knowledge base which can be shared by all
applications. My main occupation consists of supporting and managing
shared knowledge bases at a high level (i.e., the knowledge base level
and not the knowledge level).  In other words, I am trying to find a
design nodel for knowledge bases which will help in supporting their
sharing.  By a design model I mean structure and function of such
knowledge bases.  I just found a reference which explains how to
represent and to treat a knowledge base.  It is "KRYPTON: A FUNCTIONAL
APPROACH TO KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION" written by R.J. BRACHMAN, where
BRACHMAN, in order to construct his knowledge base called Krypton,
treated a knowled ge base like an abstract data type characterized by a
set of operations. All interactions between a user and a Krypton
knowledge base are mediated by these operations.

I need to know if there are other references which study the problem of
representation structures for knowledge bases (and not for knowledge).
In addition, I look forword to discuss my work and my ideas concerning
modeling of knowledge bases or sharing of them, with anyone who feels
involved in this domain of research. It will be really such a good thing
if we can deal with knowledge bases as typed structures and if we can
associate to these structures a set of oprerations to manipulate them.

Thank you in advance for any help.
        
Sincerely,

I'm looking for some advice about articles and books (articles
preferably) that would introduce Distributed Artificial Intelligence. In
particular, I'm looking for information on Speech Acts and their use in
DAI communication.  Any help would be gratefully achieved.

As always, the first place to check is:

Stuart C. Shapiro (ed.), 1992, Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence,
2nd edition (New York: John Wiley).

          		C.A.D.D.I.E.
       (Control and Direction of Distributed Intelligent Agents)

Dowty Command and Control Systems would like to announce the completion
of a 3 year study into Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). Funded
by the Department of Trade and Industry, this project has been a 3 part
collaboration between ourselves, Logica, and the University of Essex.
The goals of this project were to achieve a greater understanding of
DAI, and to develop a testbed (CADDIE) which could illustrate the tools
and techniques that potentially make DAI an extremely powerful modelling
environment.

CADDIE is a dynamic/stochastic modelling tool that expresses the
behaviour of individuals (Agents) and the behaviour of groups of agents
within an organisational unit called a functional unit (FUN). The tool
allows the user to define an organisational structure and to populate
that structure with intelligent agents. FUN structures can be created by
defining a hierarchy of authority and responsibility levels.

Individual agents within CADDIE have a set of generic capabilites. They
can communicate with each other, store information about the environment
they live in, and act upon this information even when it is uncertain.
Any agent can set a goal to achieve and generate a plan to reach that
goal and if required can consult other agents to request help, i.e.
multiagent planning. Inference techniques are used to decide which task
to execute next, depending upon the level and type of knowledge that an
agent has at that time.

To illustrate the potential of this new generic toolset two scenarios
were developed. The major one is the Emergency Services scenario, which
was developed with the collaboration of TO20 of New Scotland Yard. This
was taken from an actual incident that occurred in the Thames Valley
Police Area, where a tanker laden with chemicals crashed and deposited
its load in a busy urban area. CADDIE allows users to model the events
that occurred that day, and demonstrate whether the procedures that were
used to clear up the spill were effective. It allows you to ask 'what if
?' questions by changing the level and type of knowledge that agents
have, or corrupting the messages that pass between agents so as to feed
incorrect knowledge to those agents that have to make decisions.

The second scenario demonstrates that CADDIE can be used to model
incidents at any planning level. The Emergency Services scenario is at
the tactical level whilst the Air Traffic Management (ATM) scenario is
aimed at the strategic level. This scenario demonstrates a model of flow
management units (FMU) that control the flow of aircraft around Europe's
skies. It provides a simple demonstration to show if distributed
planning is more effective than central planning of these aircraft.

During the study it became apparent that DAI is about modelling groups
of humans. To model an incident such as the Emergency Services described
above, we had to describe human behaviour. This meant that we had to
develop models to deal with uncertainty, the interaction of humans
within an organisation, the setting and achieving of goals, and the use
of resources to carry out tasks.  This lead to the development of the C2
(squared) shell which lies above the CADDIE toolset and provides a
generic set of functions for any typical scenario.

The ability to ask multiple 'what if?' questions requires some sort of
measurement for judging whether one execution of an incident is more
effective than another. Performance metrics have been developed by the
team which look at all the areas covered by a typical scenario such as
computational, C2, and application specific metrics. These are easily
configurable and allow the user to analyse different results specific to
their requirements.

CADDIE is a hypothesis tester, that allows you to programme in
procedures that you would normally use in a real world situation. These
procedures can then be tested to the extreme by setting different
initial conditions, and firing off random events designed to create
impossible situations. Sensitivity analysis can be performed to analyse
the effect on results from changes in pre-conditions. Thus users can
adjust the procedures in the model to produce the results that they
require. The ultimate aim will be to extract these new rules from the
model and apply them to real life situations to see if they are more
effective.

The toolset that has been developed fully supports an Open Systems
environment.  A client/server architecture has been implemented that
allows multiple users to access the simulation. This means that
different users can access different parts of the toolset and observe
results on multiple screens. CADDIE sits on a UNIX base and was designed
using the Booch Object Oriented Methodology. Several programming
languages are used such as C++, ROCK (Representation of Corporate
Knowledge), Prolog, and our own CADDIE syntax that provides a simple
method of describing Agents, FUNs, and the knowledge that they have.

Thus the potential for CADDIE is massive. If it can be proved that new
procedures first developed on CADDIE are more effective then this will
bring major benefits to such organisations as the police, fire brigade,
and the ambulance service. Vast sums of money can be saved by using
CADDIE to verify techniques that would otherwise be very costly to prove
in the real world. Of course training exercises in real life are still
important, but CADDIE will allow you to develop results from exercises
that have taken place, and prepare you for ones that you are going to
carry out.

In summary CADDIE can be used as a cost effective tool for running
multiple scenarios under different conditions, to verify procedures that
are being used in real life situations. CADDIE is also an extremely
powerful tool for research into organisational theory and DAI.
