Subject: More on DPS vs. MA

I'm also enjoying using DAI-List for a focused discussion on DPS vs. MA
systems.  Ed Durfee points out that it's a good thing we're doing this
before the summer ends and "term-time commitments" make it harder to
participate...but the Fall term starts later over here, so I suppose
I'll get to have the last word. :)

I apologize in advance for the length of this message.  I like reading
and writing short notes, but I want to make sure that my point here is
understood.

I wholeheartedly agree with Ed's penultimate paragraph:
> Thus, I once again argue that many DAI systems, whether DPS or MA,
> blend cooperation and competition, and that neither DPS nor MA can
> exclusively claim either of these forms of interaction.

The placement of that paragraph after a comment about my previous
message led me to believe that I may have been misunderstood. It's clear
that DPS systems can use competitive behavior (Ed's citing of Corkill's
work on "skepticism" hits the nail on the head), and that MA systems can
exploit cooperative behavior (e.g., the AAAI-86 paper, "Cooperation
without Communication," looked at cooperation in a clear Multiagent
environment).

The point that I was making in my last message was that a "pure" MA
system is one where the agents have been designed separately, by
different designers. That's why the designers' options at the design
stage are limited, and the designers can't depend on how the other
agents will act.  Scenario:  Boeing enters home-robot market, selling
mass-produced mobile agents that are able to wash dishes, clean windows,
and run simple neighborhood errands. IBM, seeing a lucrative market
developing, rushes to design its own mobile agent.  IBM's engineers need
to build their own machine to deal flexibly with other agents, including
Boeing's, and possibly other machines not yet on the market.  Actually,
Boeing had to do something similar, since their mobile robot had to deal
with human agents.

*That's* a pure Multiagent scenario. The designers can't depend on
arbitrary cooperative behavior from other agents. I don't mean they
choose not to, or it's more convenient not to---I mean they really
*can't*.

Research on multiagent systems ought to make a contribution to the
questions that must be confronted by those Boeing and IBM design teams.
The IBM team might, for example, be able to assume that the Boeing
machine will be cooperative if there are rational reasons for the Boeing
machine to act that way. This begins to touch on the work I've been
doing with Gilad Zlotkin and Eithan Ephrati on methods for reaching
consensus, which analyzes the kinds of environments we might set up that
encourage certain kinds of behavior from autonomous agents. In that
work, we might say "Negotiation protocol A has certain good features,
for example, it allows agents to reach pareto optimal rational deals,
and it discourages deception." We are arguing that Boeing and IBM
designers would both agree to use this protocol (it's in their best
interests), and that their agents then will be truthful (that's the only
rational path for the self-interested agent).

The careful reader will note the introduction of the word "pure" above.
The Boeing/IBM scenario is "pure" MA, but there are precious few actual
pure MA systems (one notable exception is the Prisoners' Dilemma
experiment that Axelrod ran years ago; the agents in that series of
games were really designed by different people who couldn't make any
assumptions about the behavior of the other automated agents).

It is becoming clear to me, though, that people are using the MA
designation to refer to centrally designed systems whose agents adopt
certain kinds of behavior. Examples of this are Keith Werkman's question
about his system, Mike Huhns' reply to that question, and a whole slew
of papers from the Modeling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World
(MAAMAW) workshop at the beginning of August (including the paper
coauthored with Ran Levy that I mentioned in a previous message).  All
these people are building centrally designed systems with competitive,
autonomous behavior among the agents, and calling them multiagent
systems. So my "pure" characterization of MA systems above is obviously
missing something, at least as the term is coming to be used.

Let me amend my MA characterization.

I still think that MA research ought to make a contribution to those
Boeing and IBM designers in the scenario above. DPS research is not as
closely related to their problem, since DPS researchers are free to make
interagent assumptions that might not be available in MA problems.  The
MA researcher, however, might make the following three-part statement:

1. "I study interaction from the point of view of 'pure' MA systems; I'm
interested in analyzing how agents that have been designed by different
designers might coordinate, compete effectively, etc."

2. "While I wait for Boeing and IBM to get their acts together and build
real autonomous agents, I will build artificial-MA systems.  These are
systems where I have designed all the agents, but I have built them to
be autonomous, and have not built them to depend on unmotivated
cooperative behavior in other agents. I will study these artificial-MA
systems, for the insights they give me into true MA interactions."

3. "My theoretical work on MA theory and my practical experience
building artificial-MA systems will also be of use to the DPS community,
since they are willing to build autonomous behavior into their agents if
they find it useful. In fact, my artificial-MA systems don't look very
different from their DPS systems. They are both centrally designed, and
might have lots of agents communicating, competing, cooperating, and
getting jobs done. At heart, though, I have built my system to analyze a
different problem. Nevertheless, we have much to share with each other."

My view of MA is that it's trying to model a different kind of
phenomenon than DPS. If you do research on questions that arise only
with purely self-motivated agents, that surely falls into the MA area.
If you build systems where agents are designed to be a priori
cooperative, that surely falls into the DPS area.  If, however, you've
built a centrally-designed system where the agents are really
autonomous, then maybe you're an MA researcher building an artificial-MA
system, and maybe you're a DPS researcher who has chosen autonomy as a
very useful behavior to build into your system. Just from looking at the
system, I wouldn't be able to tell. The papers from MAAMAW are from
people who are building artificial-MA systems, but who are (I believe)
for the most part motivated by versions of the three statements above.

Hybrid DPS/MA research is certainly a possibility, depending on the
kinds of questions that you're trying to answer.

Subject: Call for Papers - AIPS-92

      The First International Conference on AI Planning Systems
			College Park, Maryland
			   June 15-19, 1992

			   CALL FOR PAPERS

Much attention in AI has been given to the ``planning problem''---that
is, designing computational systems that can automatically generate,
debug, or optimize plans of action for one or more agents.  Planning as
a subdiscipline of AI has been around for almost thirty years, but has
recently experienced rapid growth.  The primary forums for discussion of
issues in the field have been the National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence, and a series of DARPA Workshops on Planning, Scheduling,
and Control.  This series has been increasingly successful in
stimulating high-quality work.  There are now interesting practical
algorithms for achieving efficiency in planning (some domain-dependent,
some heuristic and general).  There are formal results on the
completeness of planning algorithms in simple domains.  We are seeing
the beginning of the integration of planning theory with robot
programming.  The time is clearly ripe for the evolution of a
full-fledged conference devoted to planning.

The conference will be aimed at bringing together researchers attacking
different aspects of the planning problem and related issues.  In
addition to AI researchers, others working on planning-related issues
are also encouraged to attend. Of special interest are papers discussing
the integration of differing approaches to planning or the integration
of planning and other AI technologies.
