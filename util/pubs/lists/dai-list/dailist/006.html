			       ABSTRACT

This dissertation describes a novel approach to negotiation in
distributed problem-solving in the subfield of computer science research
called Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI).  This dissertation
looks at several important factors necessary for cooperative distributed
problem-solving, specifically in the area of agent negotiation.  A novel
form of "incremental negotiation" called knowledge-based negotiation is
presented, which includes the use of a shared knowledge representation
called shareable agent perspectives.  A grouping of two of more
shareable agent perspectives results in an "interagent issue relation"
that relates agents to domain objects by means of domain aspects.  A
relational network of interagent issue relations is maintained by an
"arbitrator agent" who assists agents when a "deadlock" situtation
occurs.  The arbitrator uses the network of interagent issue relations
to develop alternative suggestions during its mediation phase of agent
conflict resolution.  The arbitrator does this by initially reviewing
the "negotiation dialog" for relevant agent issues between conflicting
agents.  The arbitrator then searches the network of interagent issue
relations for relations that are known to exist between conflicting
agents.  These are then presented to the agents who use them to review
and rank other possible alternatives that the agents maintain locally.
This form of "issue unlinking" using shareable agent perspectives allows
the agents to develop "viable alternatives" in an "integrative" fashion.
The result is that the agents could agree on alternatives based on links
among different issues.  If agents still can not agree (mediation
fails), arbitration techniques are employed.  These include such
techniques as setting time limits and searching the negotiation dialog
for similar alternatives considered feasible at earlier stages of
negotiation.  The resulting research is demonstrated as an
implementation within a knowledge-based tool called the Designer
Fabricator Interpreter (DFI) System.  The DFI System project is one of
several knowledge-based projects at the National Science Foundation
sponsored Engineering Research Center, Advanced Technology for Large
Structural Systems (ATLSS), at Lehigh University.  The DFI system allows
a structural design engineer to review alternative steel connection
proposals, which have been cooperatively evaluated from multiple agent
perspectives, and select the connection design that is the most feasible
and economic to construct.
