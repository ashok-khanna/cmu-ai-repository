                           CALL FOR PAPERS
                          Special Track on
                   Human Computer Cooperative Work
                          to be part of the
    First International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative
                     Information Systems (ICICIS)

                      Rotterdam, May 12-14, 1993

Held in cooperation with: IEEE CS, ACM SIGART, AAAI, IFIP TC-12, NGI

I. Description

The area of Human Computer Cooperative Work (HCCW) considers the
question of how to view and support human AND machine agents as equal
partners in communication, cooperation, problem solving, and task
execution.  This area has major relevance to, in fact, may be regarded
as an intersection of, the fields of Distributed AI and CSCW, as well as
ICIS, Enterprise Integration, and Coordination Theory.

Advances have been made in DAI research towards allowing computers to
participate in collaborative work with each other through using largely
formal application-independent methods of coordination and cooperation.
Humans can participate in collaborative work with each other by using
groupware tools, such as joint editing, group scheduling, and
video-conferencing.  These cooperative processes are, however, usually
either loosely structured and informal or highly structured and very
rigid.  Thus, it is the aim of this call to solicit papers for a special
track on Human Computer Cooperative Work.  The papers should be related
to the following question:

    How can the approaches of DAI and CSCW be unified, allowing for
    the informal cooperative processes of humans to be embedded within
    the formal framework of computer-computer cooperation?

The complete track will consist of a couple of papers, together with a
panel discussion on the integration of human computer collaborative work
into its associated fields.

II. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. Integration of / Interaction among different coordination mechanisms
   at different human and software agent levels

2. Modelling of formal and informal structures on the human work /
   organizational level and how they might apply to the coordination
   and cooperation of software agents

3. Agent models and architectures - considering solutions from DAI,
   CSCW, EI, and User Modeling

4. Definition, Modeling and Formalization of cooperative styles of human
   computer interactions

5. Participation of humans in software agents' collaborative work

6. Supporting the (stand-alone and collaborative) work of humans by one
   or several software agents.

III. Format

Contributions should be double spaced, not exceeding 5000 words.  Please
indicate on the first page that the paper is a submission to the SPECIAL
TRACK on "Human Computer Coooperative Work".

IV. Important Dates
Paper submissions due:  October 19, 1992
Notification of Acceptance: January 10, 1993
Camera-ready copies:  February 20, 1993.

All accepted papers will be published by the IEEE Press in the
Conference Proceedings.  Selected papers will be published in a special
issue of the International Journal of Intelligent and Cooperative
Information Systems.
