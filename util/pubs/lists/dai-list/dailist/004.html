Preface

Organized systems of coordinated problem solvers are now a research
reality, and are rapidly becoming practical partners in critical human
problem-solving environments.  At a panel on high-impact directions for
AI research at IJCAI-89, several panelists cited Distributed AI as the
primary high-impact area.  The growth and importance of coordinated
problem-solving systems is indisputable; reasons for studying them
include:  individual intelligent processes have limited capacity to
solve large problems; the distributed computing technology to support
coordinated problem solving is now available; we would like to build
coordinated problem solvers systems for research purposes, as testbeds
for distributed reasoning, and for performance studies; and distributed
intelligence systems exist, and we would like explanatory and
prescriptive theories that account for them.

Content

We will begin with the motivation for distributed AI (DAI) and a brief
summary of the history of research in the area.  In discussing
motivation, we will highlight the insight provided by group interaction
and social organization as metaphors for computation.  We will then
survey some domains in which DAI appears to be particularly well suited,
including:  organizational information systems; manufacturing and
robotics; design; monitoring, control, and diagnosis; and distributed
sensing and interpretation.

We will then discuss approaches to each of six basic DAI problems.  The
first is problem decomposition; we will discuss the use of multiple
interacting knowledge bases, distributed planning, and alternative ways
of decomposing a problem.  The second is communication and interaction
among the distributed agents; here we will discuss communication and
interaction protocols and the use of Speech Act theory as a basis for
communication.  The third problem is the maintenance of coherence during
problem solving; we will discuss issues of distributed control and
organization.  The fourth problem is modeling other agents; we will talk
about modeling problem-solving capabilities, beliefs, plans, goals, and
the collaborative process itself.  The fifth problem is recognizing and
resolving disparities; here we will discuss the FA/C Model, negotiation,
belief nets, ATMSs, defaults, open systems, microtheories, and Due
Process.  The final problem is implementation; we will talk about
object-based concurrent programming languages such as Actors, reflective
languages, frameworks such as ABE, MACE, and AGORA, and blackboard
systems.

Intended Audience

This tutorial is targeted for people who are interested in building DAI
systems, for AI researchers interested in learning about DAI approaches,
and possibly for technology planners and managers who need to know about
leading-edge AI technologies.  The tutorial presumes knowledge of AI at
the level of an introductory course, and familiarity with such general
concepts as first-order predicate calculus, object-oriented systems,
Lisp, hierarchical and nonlinear planning, heuristic search,
knowledge-based systems, reasoning under uncertainty, and so on.

Speakers

Les Gasser received his B.A. in English from the University of
Massachusetts, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from U.C.
Irvine.  Dr. Gasser is on the faculty of Computer Science at the
University of Southern California, where he leads the Distributed
Artificial Intelligence Research Group.  He developed and teaches the
advanced graduate course on Distributed AI at USC, and has published two
books on Distributed AI:  Readings in Distributed Artificial
Intelligence (With A. Bond, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988) and Distributed
Artificial Intelligence, Volume II (With Michael N. Huhns, Pitman
Publishers/Morgan Kaufman, 1989).  He chaired the 1988 Workshop on
Distributed Artificial Intelligence, and has published widely in the
field.

Jeffrey S. Rosenschein received his A.B. in Applied Mathematics from
Harvard University, and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from
Stanford University.  He is currently a Lecturer in the Computer Science
Department at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.    His dissertation
on "Rational Interaction:  Cooperation Among Intelligent Agents" broke
new ground in the Artificial Intelligence community with its study of
principles of multiple agent interactions.  His research since that time
has continued to focus on issues of cooperation and competition among
high-level problem solving entities.  Dr. Rosenschein has taught courses
at Hebrew University and in industry on introductory and advanced topics
in Artificial Intelligence, and has authored various articles on
multiagent problem solving.

Subject: DAI Tutorial at IEA/AIE-90

            Distributed Artificial Intelligence
                           by
           Michael N. Huhns and Larry M. Stephens
to be presented at the Third International Conference on Industrial
and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert
Systems, Charleston, SC, July 15-18, 1990.

Overview and Motivation

Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with the
cooperative solution of problems by a decentralized group of agents.
It is the appropriate technology for applications where
1) expertise is distributed, as in design;
2) information is distributed, as in office automation;
3) data are distributed, as in distributed sensing;
4) decisions are distributed, as in manufacturing control; and
5) knowledge bases are developed independently but must be
interconnected or reused, as in next-generation knowledge engineering.
Interconnecting computational agents and expert systems enables them to
cooperate in solving problems, to share expertise, to work in parallel
on common problems, to be developed and implemented modularly, to be
fault tolerant through redundancy, to represent multiple viewpoints and
the knowledge of multiple human experts, and to be reusable.

Content

This tutorial will describe the current state of research in distributed
artificial intelligence.  It will present architectures, languages, and
techniques for achieving cooperative problem solving in a distributed
environment, and describe several successful applications of DAI in
manufacturing, information retrieval, and distributed sensing.  The
specific topics to be covered are
1) A brief history of DAI
2) Communication among agents, expert systems, and users:  syntax
3) Communication:  semantics and speech-act theory
4) Decomposing and distributing problems among agents
5) Distributing control among agents
6) Modeling global goals, the global problem-solving state, and other
agents
7) Maintaining consistent beliefs among agents
8) Applications and implementations, including blackboards

Intended Audience

This tutorial is intended for computer scientists and engineers
interested in constructing DAI systems, for computer researchers
interested in learning current DAI theory, and for managers interested
in staying abreast of next-generation AI technology.  The audience is
presumed to have a working knowledge of artificial intelligence
terminology and techniques at the level of an introductory course.
