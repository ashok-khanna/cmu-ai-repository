   EAST-WEST AI CONFERENCE: from theory to practice - EWAIC'93
                Moscow, Russia, September 7-9, 1993

The major aims of the "East-West Conference on Artificial Intelligence:
From Theory to Practice" are to provide a forum for the exchange of
ideas between Eastern and Western scientists regarding the current
state-of-the-art of the field of Artificial Intelligence and its
applications.  The main goal of the conference is to identify and study
the relation between theory and practice.

Subject: CFP for Workshop on Neural Architectures and Distributed AI
Date: Mon, 19 Jul 1993 17:57:07 GMT

The Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California
announces a Workshop on
		Neural Architectures and Distributed AI:
		From Schema Assemblages to Neural Networks
			October 19-20, 1993

Program Committee: Michael Arbib (Organizer), George Bekey, Damian
Lyons, Paul Rosenbloom, and Ron Sun

To design complex technological systems, we need a multilevel
methodology which combines a coarse-grain analysis of cooperative or
distributed computation (we shall refer to the computing agents at this
level as "schemas") with a fine-grain model of flexible, adaptive
computation (for which neural networks provide a powerful general
paradigm).  Schemas provide a language for distributed artificial
intelligence and perceptual robotics which is "in the style of the
brain", but at a relatively high level of abstraction relative to neural
networks.  We seek (both at the level of schema asemblages, and in terms
of "modular" neural networks) a distributed model of computation,
supporting many concurrent activities for recognition of objects, and
the planning and control of different activities.  The use,
representation, and recall of knowledge is mediated through the activity
of a network of interacting computing agents which between them provide
processes for going from a particular situation and a particular
structure of goals and tasks to a suitable course of action.  This
action may involve passing of messages, changes of state, instantiation
to add new schema instances to the network, deinstantiation to remove
instances, and may involve self-modification and self-organization.
Schemas provide a form of knowledge representation which differs from
frames and scripts by being of a finer granularity.  Schema theory is
generative: schemas may well be linked to others to provide yet more
comprehensive schemas, whereas frames tend to "build in" from the
overall framework.  The analysis of interacting computing agents (the
schema instances) is intermediate between the overall specification of
some behavior and the neural networks that subserve it.  The Workshop
will focus on different facets of this multilevel methodology.  While
the emphasis will be on technological systems, papers will also be
accepted on biological and cognitive systems.

Submission of Papers

A list of sample topics for contributions is as follows, where a hybrid
approach means one in which the abstract schema level is integrated with
neural or other lower level models:

Schema Theory as a description language for neural networks

Modular neural networks

Alternative paradigms for modeling symbolic and subsymbolic knowledge

Hierarchical and distributed representations:  adaptation and coding:

Linking DAI to Neural Networks to Hybrid Architecture

Formal Theories of Schemas

Hybrid approaches to integrating planning & reaction

Hybrid approaches to learning 

Hybrid approaches to commonsense reasoning by integrating neural
networks and rule-based reasoning (using schemas for the integration)

Programming Languages for Schemas and Neural Networks

Schema Theory Applied in Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics, and
Neuroscience

Prospective contributors should send a five-page extended abstract,
including figures with informative captions and full references - a hard
copy, either by regular mail or fax - by August 15, 1993 to Michael
Arbib, Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California,
Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520, USA [Tel:  (213) 740-9220, Fax: (213)
746-2863, arbib@pollux.usc.edu].  Please include your full address,
including fax and email, on the paper.

In accepting papers submitted in response to this Call for Papers,
preference will be given to papers which present practical examples of,
theory of, and/or methodology for the design and analysis of complex
systems in which the overall specification or analysis is conducted in
terms of a network of interacting schemas, and where some but not
necessarily all of the schemas are implemented in neural networks.
Papers which present a single neural network for pattern recognition
("perceptual schema") or pattern generation ("motor schema") will not be
accepted.  It is the development of a methodology to analyze the
interaction of multiple functional units that constitutes the
distinctive thrust of this Workshop.

Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent by email no later
than September 1, 1993.  There are currently no plans to issue a formal
proceedings of full papers, but (revised versions) of accepted abstracts
received prior to October 1, 1993 will be collected with the full text
of the Tutorial in a CNE Technical Report which will be made available
to registrants at the start of the meeting.

A number of papers have already been accepted for the Workshop.  These
include the following:

Arbib: Schemas and Neural Networks: A Tutorial Introduction to
Integrating Symbolic and Subsymbolic Approaches to Cooperative
Computation

Arkin: Reactive Schema-based Robotic Systems:  Principles and Practice

  We at AAII have been working on Intelligent Agents for the past five
years.  We have worked on a number of applications including the one
mentioned above for NASA (along with SRI International). There has been
a lot of theoretical and experimental work on the subject as well. I am
enclosing a bibliography of some of our recent papers in this area.
  The paper in IEEE-Expert talks about the above mentioned project with
NASA.  Please email me if you need more details.
