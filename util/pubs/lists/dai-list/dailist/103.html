Subject: Knowledge Sharing for Planning and Scheduling

As a special interest subgroup of SRKB phase II activity, we are looking
for ways to facilitate the sharing and reuse of knowledge used in
planning and scheduling. Our long-term goal is to enable libraries of
formally represented, sharable knowledge.  Specifically, we are going to
explore representation primitives, which will be a basis for developing
tools that share models and exchange knowledge at run time. Since
scheduling and planning tasks are found in a variety of application
domains such as manufacturing, transportation, and manning, it should be
possible to share models of domains and problem-solving processes. Thus,
our challenge here is to devise a sharable basis for those knowledge
representations, appropriately abstracting activities in particular
applications.

One of the characteristic features of planning and scheduling is
representation of time.  Although the ontologies for temporal intervals
and relations are rather generic, they will be a good starting point for
this subgroup's discussion.  Another issue will be the resources that
define capacity and capabilities. In the case of production scheduling,
a type of machine provides a certain capacity for processing, and an
order or an operation may consume an amount of that capacity for a
certain period of time. This kind of perspective is relatively common,
but further assumptions and commitments must be clarified with respect
to the details such as measurement units and representation of
attributes associated with resources and consumers, accommodating the
differences among representation systems.

This message is an invitation for you to participate in the activities
of this working group. In accordance with the general strategy of the
SRKB phase II activity, which is to collect, analyze, and experiment
with ontologies, a possible road map of this subgroup's activities will
include the following:

 * Introduce ongoing projects related to this topic
    - exchange of short descriptions by email
    - further exchange of papers

 * Discuss similarities and differences in those projects
    - with examples of time, resources ...
    - clarifying assumptions about the expected scope

 * Collect several sample planning and scheduling tasks to be
   described by using ontologies
    - various testbed examples such as trivial ones, moderate ones,
      and real cases.

Of course, the road map is not restricted to the one above, but can
change to accommodate participants' interests. Please note that this
working group activity is not intended to establish a standard for
knowledge representation in planning and scheduling. One of the main
objectives is to capture the rationale underlying the design of related
ontologies. Thus, it is feasible that various ontologies coexist, all
more or less reflecting their own design decisions. This pose an
important research issue that is to accommodate modularized ontologies,
clarifying the assumptions and commitments associated with those
reusable modules. Ultimately, we plan to conduct a small experiment on
translatability among ontologies. Those ontologies may include ones
proposed by other special interest subgroups, since some of them may be
interrelated. The results will be more practical if subgroups
collaborate in appropriate areas.

CURRENT PROJECTS IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING FOR PLANNING AND SCHEDULING

At least three current projects are associated with this special
interest subgroup. We would like to call for more related projects.

One is the DARPA/Rome Laboratory Planning and Scheduling Initiative
(DRPI).  DRPI is currently supporting a group of 30 or so researchers in
the fields of Planning, Scheduling, Knowledge Representation, Case-based
Reasoning, Decision Theory, and Database Management with the objective
to build integrated, cooperative knowledge based systems. The initiative
is organized around a 12 to 18 month cycle of Integrated Feasibility
Demonstrations (IFD) and a 4 to 6 month schedule of Technology
Integration Experiments (TIE). Each IFD must demonstrate a significant
contribution toward solving a critical problem in the domain of Joint
Operations Planning as illustrated by problems posed in planning
operations, communications, and transportation in Desert Shield/Desert
Storm. The TIEs are focused on demonstrating system interoperability at
a smaller scale.  Over the past two years, the DRPI Knowledge
Representation and Architecture Issue Working Group has been guiding the
development of a knowledge specification language and system
infrastructure to support these cooperative systems. The Knowledge
Representation Specification Language (KRSL) is the results. KRSL
outlines an ontology for representing time, measurement, objects and
concepts, and planning primitives. A shared domain onotology for Joint
Operations Planning is being developed in the the KRSL language. (For
more information on KRSL contact Nancy Lehrer, nlehrer@isx.com)

The second is the MULTIS project, which has been conducted at Osaka
University since 1987. Major efforts have been devoted to development of
a task analysis interview system for a general class of scheduling
tasks, though the methodology employed is not restricted to scheduling.
In the course of the MULTIS project, a set of two-layered ontologies
were identified for representing problem solving engines for scheduling
and their use in task analysis interview with domain experts. The
higher-level ontology represents human problem solving process at the
knowledge level and is used for the task analysis interview where it
contributes to filling the conceptual gap between the computer and the
domain experts. The lower one consists of a set of abstract programs
used as building blocks of problem solving engine. The first version of
task ontology for scheduling has been edited. (For more information,
please contact Riichiro Mizoguchi <miz@ei.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp>)

The third is the CAKE project, which has been conducted since 1990. It
was started to establish a methodology for configuring problem-solving
methods with smaller-grained problem-solving components.  A class of
scheduling problems is focused on. It is called a job assignment task,
which is characterized as a set of four elements:  jobs, resources, time
range, and constraints. The task can be described as assigning all given
jobs to the available resources within a specific time range, while
satisfying various constraints.  Two kinds of ontology are being
designed: one is a task ontology for problem specification; the other is
a problem-solving ontology for representing the problem-solving
processes. These ontologies are defined in KIF and Ontolingua. (For more
information contact Masahiro Hori <hori@trl.vnet.ibm.com>)

Subject: CFP for Production Planning, Scheduling, and Control Workshop

                       Call for Papers
     Knowledge-Based Production Planning, Scheduling, and Control

                       IJCAI-93 Workshop
                       Chambery, France
                       August 29, 1993 

In a global market economy, the need for cost-efficient production
management techniques is becoming more critical every day. Instead,
current practice is often characterized by low levels of due date
satisfaction, high levels of inventory, and more generally a state of
chaos, in which computer systems used to provide managerial guidance do
not reflect the current state of affairs and rely on oversimplified
models of the factory. A major challenge for research in this area is
to develop new planning, scheduling and control techniques that can
account more precisely for actual production management constraints and
objectives and are better suited for handling production contingencies.

Over the past decade Artificial Intelligence techniques have been
developed that attempt to provide more realistic and versatile
solutions to production planning, scheduling, and control problems.
Some of these new techniques are now starting to find their way into
practical systems, both customized knowledge-based systems and generic
commercial packages. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum to
review the state of the art in knowledge-based production management,
report recent advances and identify remaining challenges in the field.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

Uncertainty Management: Manufacturing is a process often fraught with
contingencies. Realistic production management techniques need to
account for uncertainty both proactively and reactively.

Learning: (How) can learning techniques be used to enhance current
techniques/tools ?

Constraint-based Scheduling and Control Techniques:
Constraint/preference propagation techniques, variable/value ordering
heuristics, intelligent backtracking/TMS-based techniques, iterative
repair heuristics, etc.

Coordination Issues in Decentralized/Distributed Knowledge-based
Production Management: This includes coordination issues in both
homogenous and heterogenous systems, system architecture issues,
integration of strategic and tactical decision making, multiplant
coordination, etc.

Iterative Improvement Techniques for Combinatorial Optimization:
Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Neural Nets, etc.

Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research: Comparative studies and
innovative applications combining AI and OR techniques.


This one day workshop will include paper presentations, panel
discussions, and general discussions on the above topics.

Submission Requirements:

Those interested in participating should submit three copies of a 2-4

Subject: CFP for Workshop on Expertise


+    The Third International Workshop on Human & Machine Cognition      +
+           Topic - Expertise in Context: Human & Machine               +
+                  Seaside, Florida -- MAY 13-15, 1993                  +

                          CALL FOR PAPERS

Several disciplines share an interest in understanding the concept of
expertise. For instance, computerized "expert systems" form the best
known applications of AI (artificial intelligence), in fact, the concept
of an 'expert system' has become so prevalent that many people have come
to equate the whole of AI with them. But what is the expertise that
expert systems can be said to have? This raises many questions. The
workshop will focus on the concept of expertise with special emphasis on
implications for the AI and cognitive science research communities.

Some interpret the history, philosophy, and sociology of science as
challenging the confidence we have placed in our traditional methods of
generating knowledge. For example, history informs us that knowledge is
highly fragile, that it is at the mercy of shifts in historical context,
and that yesterday's experts are today's museum pieces. So how can we
have high confidence in modern expertise? Expertise develops, and is
labeled as such, in a social context. Nevertheless, we all act as if we
believe that some expert knowledge is more than merely social
construction. What is the relation between the individual and group
processes involved in knowledge in general and expertise in particular?
What is the relation between the acquisition of individual expertise and
the acquisition of group expertise, for example, by a firm or industry?

Recent work in psychology has focused on the cognitive strategies that
separate novices from experts, and the mechanisms by which expertise is
acquired. Fundamental debates in statistics and psychology have
concerned the measurement and assessment of expertise. What (if
anything) do the empirical tools of psychology and the observational
skills of ethnomethodology tell us about expertise and how it is
acquired? How does 'expertise' differ from mere 'knowledge'? Do the
differences have to do with skill level? With domain? With social
practices concerning deference, respect or authority? How can expertise
be assessed and compared? Can experts be calibrated? What is required
for a domain to admit expertise at all?

And finally, what are the specific implications of various theories of
expertise for those engaged in the design and construction of
knowledge-based systems? What are the representational ramifications for
the knowledge engineer of the widespread observation that expert
reasoning seems to differ qualitatively from novice reasoning? How are
the computer instantiations of expertise related to human expertise and
knowledge? Some work in machine learning is aimed at developing systems
that independently acquire expertise by use of statistical or inductive
methods - can this be said to be expertise?

The workshop on "Expertise in Context: Human & Machine" will bring
together researchers from diverse areas to consider these important
questions. Other topics of interest include the following:

        Situated cognition & expertise  
        Are experts Bayesian? 
        Novice-expert shift     
        Cognitive models of expertise
        Issues of expert bias   
        Expertise as an attribution
        Expertise &  negative metaknowledge  
        Constructivist vs. Realist views of expertise 
        Episodic memory and expertise   
        Expertise for animal intelligences only?

The workshop will be kept small - about 45 participants. In general,
attendance will be limited to those presenting their work: one author
per paper. The contribution of each presenter will be considered for
inclusion as a chapter in a subsequent edited volume. Three copies of an
extended abstract (from 5 to 8 pages) should be sent to Ken Ford
(address below) before February 28, 1993.
