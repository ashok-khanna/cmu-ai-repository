Subject: References on ATC and Networks

We are trying to build a reference library on DAI approaches to
air-traffic control and telecommunication network management.  We hope
to keep this library up to date, and supply references to anyone who
needs them.  However, it will be probably a couple of months before we
are ready to provide the service.

May I ask you to send me, on a continuing basis, any new references you
may encounter in these areas and also copies of your own reports, so
that we can provide a good service to the research community.

Thanking you for your cooperation,

Prof. S. Misbah Deen
