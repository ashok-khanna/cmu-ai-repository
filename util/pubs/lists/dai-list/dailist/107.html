Subject:  Brief Report from IJCAI Program Committee

Hi,

Distributed artificial intelligence seems to be an increasingly active
field of research within AI.  I just returned from a meeting of the
IJCAI-93 Program Committee, where the number of submissions in DAI has
increased significantly since IJCAI-91.  This year, over 10% of the
submitted papers were in DAI, and it has become the third most popular
field (behind machine learning and knowledge representation).  The
IJCAI-93 program will include 20 papers in DAI and two invited DAI
talks:
  "Social Knowledge and Social Action" by Les Gasser
  "Consenting Agents:  Foundations of Distributed Artificial
Intelligence" by Jeffrey Rosenschein.

Subject: Result of my query on DAI (distributed AI)

Here is the proposed summary of the responses to my question regarding
distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) on comp.ai and comp.ai.shells.
It also has been included in the DAI-List Digest 106.

I have received more than 20 responses with enough hints to keep me
working for some time. I fetched several kilograms of paper in our
library last week.  Thanks to everybody who contributed. Those who
offered me further information may get some specific questions later,
when I read some of the recomended stuff.

Please don't feel insulted, if you are not mentioned in this posting, or
if the provided information is not correct.  I'm sorry, this took so
long.  Unfortunately other things are begging to be done.

To those of you who were interested in my own work in this area, I have
to tell you, there is none (not yet?). That's why I wanted to find out
what has been done so far.

facts.  It is not meant to be complete.

Subject: AAAI-93 WORKSHOP ON AI IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
            THE AAAI-93 WORKSHOP ON AI IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN
       in conjunction with AAAI-93, Washington DC, 11-16 July 1993

Design is recognized as being among the most complex of the intelligent
human endeavors. AI in design has helped to develop renewed interest in
design research and design computing by providing a symbolic approach to
modeling complex recognition and decision making. Until recently, most
AI in design research considered design as an activity carried out by a
single person and provided support tools for the individual. Design,
today, is rarely carried out by an individual working alone, but by
individuals or groups working collaboratively. AI addresses models of
problem solving for both individual and multiagent activities, and
consequently has the potential to shape this developing field.

This workshop is of particular interest at this time because there is an
increasing focus on the use of AI in design environments but a lack of
comprehensive models for collaborative design. AI provides
representation and reasoning paradigms which have extended the use of
computers in design beyond graphical CAD and numerical analysis towards
knowledge-based systems. Current developments in collaborative design
focus on communication among individuals or processes across multiple
domains, where collaboration can occur among homogeneous or
heterogeneuos design views. Where AI-based design process models address
an individual's multiple views, AI-based collaborative design must focus
on merging and communication multiple views across multiple individuals.

The organisers of this workshop provide two distinct perspectives on the
topic of AI in collaborative design. One perspective is to view it as an
AI problem, the other is to view it as a design problem. This workshop
will bring together AI researchers and professionals interested in
design problem solving and design researchers and professionals who use
AI techniques.

Objectives:
The main objectives of this workshop are to provide a forum for
researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence in
collaborative design, to discuss state-of-the-art experimental research,
and to set a new agenda for future research and development in the
field.

The workshop will focus on the following issues:
* DAI in collaborative design
* languages for communication and cooperation
* representation and communication of design intent
* intelligent user interfaces for groupwork
* intelligent synchronous multimedia interaction
* models for developing groupware
* symbolic approaches to visual reasoning
* recognition of emergence of new properties

Format of the Workshop:
The workshop is designed to have a round-table format. Up to four
presentations selected from the submitted papers will be given. The
presentations will act as catalysts for discussion.  Attendance at the
workshop will be restricted to people who submit papers. The number of
attendees will be limited.

Submission Details:
Four copies of either full papers (maximum 20 pages) or extended
abstracts (approximately 5 pages) should be sent either electronically 
or as hard copy to:

Subject: CFP AAAI Workshop: also an area for DAI applications?!

          AAAI-93 Workshop on AI in Service and Support:
        Bridging the Gap Between Research and Applications

DESCRIPTION:

The areas of customer service and support are poised to be leading areas
for revenue growth to companies in the 90's. A 1991 market study shows
that 23 percent of high technology service organizations have already
begun building AI based systems, and 67 percent expect to be using AI
within 3 years. This full-day workshop will gather researchers and
developers who are working on exploring or applying AI techniques (such
as expert systems, case-based reasoning, model-based reasoning,
intelligent information retrieval, neural networks, fuzzy logic, etc) in
the areas of customer service and support in industry as well as
government.  The goal of this workshop is encourage interactions between
researchers (from university and corporate laboratories) and developers
of AI systems so as to bridge the gap between current research in
artificial intelligence and current needs in service organizations.

TOPICS:

Papers are encouraged in, but not limited to, the following areas:
- diagnosis
- advisory activities
- information retrieval
- workforce planning and dispatch
- resource and inventory management
- hardware and software configuration management
- automated knowledge acquisition
- emergency response centers
- call center management
- billing and account servicing, and
- various value-added services

Corporate service organizations frequently consist of geographically
dispersed groups whose work is intertwined. Also, the rate at which new
products are being introduced makes it harder for support personnel to
be on top of things. Keeping this in mind, we would also encourage
researchers in the following areas to participate by focusing on how
their research could be applied to service and support:

 - Knowledge Sharing (such as that being conducted by PACT, including
Stanford University) between functional groups such as engineering,
service, and billing groups.
 - Machine Learning, to augment the shortcomings of knowledge-based
systems currently in use
 - Natural-Language translation, for service groups that are located in
different countries but use the same underlying tools or applications
 - Designing systems for serviceability
 - Groupware
 - Distributed AI, for example, for allowing various expert systems to
work cooperatively in a help-desk environment

FORMAT OF WORKSHOP:
This will be a full day workshop split into 4 sessions of 90 minutes
each and will include paper sessions as well as panels. The areas of
focus of the paper sessions and panels will depend on the range of
papers accepted, and will be specified later.

ATTENDANCE: 
Developers and reserchers interested in applying advanced Artificial
Intelligence technology to the areas of customer service and support in
industry as well as government. This workshop will encourage interaction
between researchers and developers.  In order to facilitate interaction,
attendance will be limited to 50 people.

SUBMISSSION REQUIREMENTS:
Prospective participants should send 4 copies of papers not more than 8
pages long (not including the title page and bibliography). A subset of
the participants will be selected as speakers.  Those who are interested
in attending but do not want to be considered for presentations may send
a detailed abstract describing their work and the reasons for their
interest in this workshop.
