Stan Rosenschein and I are editing a special issue of the AI Journal on
"Computational Theories of Interaction and Agency".  We started from the
observation that a wide variety of people in AI and cognitive science
are using principled characterizations of interactions between agents
and their environments to guide their theorizing and designing and
modeling.  Some connectionist projects I've heard about fit this
description as well, and people engaged in such projects would be most
welcome to contribute articles to our special issue.  I've enclosed the
call for papers.  Please feel free to pass it along to anyone who might
be interested.  And I can send further details to anyone who's curious.

Thanks very much.

Artificial Intelligence: An International Journal
Special Issue on Computational Theories of Interaction and Agency

Edited by Philip E. Agre (UC San Diego) and 
          Stanley J. Rosenschein (Teleos Research)

Call for Papers

Recent computational research has greatly deepened our understanding of
agents' interactions with their environments.  The first round of
research in this area developed `situated' and `reactive' architectures
that interact with their environments in a flexible way.  These
`environments', however, were characterized in very general terms, and
often purely negatively, as `uncertain', `unpredictable', and the like.
In the newer round of research, psychologists and engineers are using
sophisticated characterizations of agent-environment interactions to
motivate explanatory theories and design rationales.  This research
opens up a wide variety of new issues for computational research.  But
more fundamentally, it also suggests a revised conception of computation
itself as something that happens in an agent's involvements in its
world, and not just in the abstractions of its thought.

The purpose of this special issue of Artificial Intelligence is to draw
together the remarkable variety of computational research that has
recently been developing along these lines.  These include:

 * Task-level robot sensing and action strategies, as well as projects
   that integrate classical robot dynamics with symbolic reasoning.

 * Automata-theoretic formalizations of agent-environment interactions.

 * Studies of "active vision" and related projects that approach
   perception within the broader context of situated activity.

 * Theories of the social conventions and dynamics that support activity.

 * Foundational analyses of situated computation.

 * Models of learning that detect regularities in the interactions
   between an agent and its environment. 

This list is only representative and could easily be extended to include
further topics in robotics, agent architectures, artificial life,
reactive planning, distributed AI, human-computer interaction, cognitive
science, and other areas.  What unifies these seemingly disparate
research projects is their emerging awareness that the explanation and
design of agents depends on principled characterizations of the
interactions between those agents and their environments.  We hope that
this special issue of the AI Journal will clarify trends in this new
research and take a first step towards a synthesis.  The articles in the
special issue will probably also be reprinted in a book to be published
by MIT Press.

The deadline for submitted articles is 1 September 1992.  Send articles
