EVOLUTIONARY GAMES AND COMPUTER SIMULATIONS
Bernardo A. Huberman and Natalie S. Glance

Abstract

The prisoner's dilemma has long been considered the paradigm for
studying the emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals. Because
of its importance, it has been studied through computer experiments as
well as in the laboratory and by analytical means. However, there are
important differences between the way a system composed of many
interacting elements is simulated by a digital machine and the manner in
which it behaves when studied in real experiments. In some instances,
these disparities can be marked enough so as to cast doubt on the
implications of cellular automata type simulations for the study of
cooperation in social systems. In particular, if such a simulation
imposes space-time granularity, then its ability to describe the real
world may be compromised. Indeed, we show that the results of digital
simulations regarding territoriality and cooperation differ greatly when
time is discrete as opposed to continuous.

Subject: CFP -- 2nd Int. Conf. on Information and Knowledge Management

     **  CIKM-93 Call for Papers  --  April 1, 1993 deadline  **

CIKM-93, the Second International Conference on Information and
Knowledge Management will be held November 1-5, 1993 at the Double Tree
Hotel in Washington D.C., USA.  CIKM-93 is sponsored by ACM through
SIGART and SIGIR (pending) and ISCA and held in cooperation with AAAI
and the Univ. of Maryland.

Like the successful CIKM-92, it will provide an international forum for
presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge
management, as well as recent advances on databases, knowledge bases,
and text bases. Authors are invited to submit papers, proposals for
tutorials and exhibits concerned with theory or practice or both.
Papers should be sent to the Program Chair, Dr. Bharat Bhargava, by
April 1, 1993.

** Send email to CIKM-INFO@CS.UMBC.EDU to receive an automatic reply **
**	       with a full copy of the Call for Papers.              **

Call for papers for a Special Track on  
Emerging Paradigms for Intelligent Systems  

The Twenty-Seventh Annual 
Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 
Maui, HI - January 4--7, 1994 
 
Papers are invited on issues relating to the design and development of
integrated AI architectures based on emerging computational technologies
(distributed processing, object-oriented design, concurrent processing,
visualization techniques, standardized interfaces, etc.)  The goals of
the track are to bring together researchers actively involved in the
design of intelligent systems (and intelligent applications) as well as
those involved in the development of computational technologies that
are viable models for implementation of large intelligent systems.
Issues of interest in this track include the impact of using new
computational paradigms for the design of intelligent systems, as well
as the amenability of integrated approaches to intelligent
architectures towards the employment of new computational models.
Papers describing research as well as position papers are invited in,
but not restricted to, the following topics (specifically contributing
towards the identification of emerging paradigms for intelligent
architectures):

integrated AI architectures   		unified AI ontologies   
integrating reasoning strategies 	concurrent AI models   
distributed AI models   		hybrid KR systems  
hybrid reasoning strategies   		object-oriented AI design   
concurrent object-oriented design 
 
SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 
Manuscripts should be less than 25 typewritten, double-spaced pages, and
should not have been previously presented or published. Selection of
papers for presentation at the conference will be based on a rigorous
refereeing process.  Accepted papers will also be published in the
conference proceedings. The title page of each manuscript should include
the title of the paper, full name(s) of the author(s), affiliation(s),
complete postal and electronic mailing address(es), telephone number(s),
and a 300 word abstract.

DEADLINES 
- A 500-word extended abstract indicating an intention to submit is due
  by April 15, 1993.
- Six copies of the manuscript due by June 7, 1993.
- Notification of accepted papers by August 31, 1993.
- Accepted manuscripts, camera-ready, are due by October 1, 1993.

TOPIC:    Hierarchical and Multigranular Neural-Based Simulation Systems
SPEAKER:  Dr. Alfredo Weitzenfeld, USC.
DATE:     Thursday, 18 March 1993

ABSTRACT:    The talk presents current work at the USC Brain Simulation
Laboratory in the development of a hierarchical and multigranular
simulation system for integrating low level neural network components
with high level "schemas" (coarse grained computational agents). This
effort has lead to the development of the Abstract Schema Language
(ASL), unifying schema modeling with concurrent object-oriented
programming methodologies.  Schemas in ASL are functional units which
get implemented in an orthogonal fashion. This aspect not only
encourages code procedural programs or neural network processes. ASL
addresses reusability, but enables schema implementations as, e.g., the
need to separate task specification from actual task implementation, by
utilizing the concept of dynamic task delegation and static wrapping of
external programs.  ASL schemas define class templates from which
active objects get dynamically instantiated. Schemas incorporate a
dynamic interface made of multiple input and output ports, plus a body
section which explicitly specifies the schema behavior.  Communication
is in the form of asynchronous message passing, hierarchically managed
through anonymous port reading and writing, at one level, and dynamic
port interconnections and relabelings, specified at a higher level. ASL
supports object composition, through the notion of schema assemblages,
enabling top-down and bottom-up model designs. This work is based on the
Neural Simulation Language, extended to give new meaning to NSL, that of
Neural Schema Language, developed as a domain specific system based on
the ASL model. NSL supports the development of complex applications in
the areas of Brain Theory and Distributed Artificial Intelligence. The
NSL model supports modeling of neurons, described with different levels
of internal detail, and neural networks which may be interconnected as
networks of networks. Domain specific examples are given. Finally,
future research paths are discussed.

BIOGRAPHY:   Alfredo Weitzenfeld has a BS in Electrical Engineering from
the TECHNION in Israel; a MS in Computer Engieneering and a PhD in
Computer Science both from USC.  He is the manager of the Brain
Simulation Laboratory at the USC Center for Neural Engineering.
