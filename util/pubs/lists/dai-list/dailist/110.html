INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT AND COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
				ICICIS 93

	In Cooperation with: AAAI, ACM Sigart, IEEE, IFIP DC. 12, NGI

			    May 11-14, 1993
	Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands

The Conference
==============
 
The purpose of the International Conference on Intelligent & Cooperative
Information Systems (ICICIS) is to provide a forum for presentation and
discussion of research, development and practice in the various forms of
intelligent and cooperative processing.  The establishment of this forum
will contribute towards the evolution of Intelligent Cooperative
Information Systems (ICIS), thereby leading to their appreciation by the
wider computer science community and their integration into the next
generation of information systems.
 
Such information systems consist of a large number of preexisting
information repositories and intelligent information agents distributed
widely over computer/communication networks.  The agents are social in
nature and capable of interacting closely to solve common complex
problems.  Work tasks are defined by one or more agents and are executed
by agents acting autonomously, cooperatively, or collaboratively,
depending on the resources required to complete the task.  In spite of
their independence and geographic separation from one another, these
agents act as a unified, opportunistic, problem-solving network.  In
general, we consider the community of local information agents that
jointly execute a common task to be a global intelligent information
system, viz. the Intelligent and Cooperative Information System.

ICIS is a new paradigm in computing, evolving from several currently
disjoint technologies.  It draws on Database Systems, Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Distributed AI (DAI), Distributed Computing,
Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Knowledge Engineering.
Other relevant technologies include Cooperative Work, Office Information
Systems, and Interoperability.  ICIS will result from the appropriate
integration of these technologies and the cooperation of researchers and
practitioners in them.

The ICIS conference is concerned with this paradigm and the concepts,
techniques, and tools in support of ICIS.  Specifically, the conference
provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and for the identification of
the potential roles and nature of the emerging notion of ICIS, and
examines a wide spectrum of issues related to interdisciplinary research
and development in ICIS.  It helps assess the state-of-the-art and chart
future prospects for ICIS.

Topics include applications or research in:

 o Novel Architectures for ICIS
 
 o Advanced Modelling and Reasoning Techniques for Intelligent
   Information Processing

 o Knowledge Engineering Techniques in ICIS

 o Data/Knowledge Representation and Management Techniques for
   Coordinating Multiple Cooperating Agents

 o Interoperability Issues in Distributed, Heterogeneous Knowledge
   Bases 

 o Techniques for Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving

 o Standards Contributing to ICIS

 o Transaction Models for Cooperative Information Systems

 o Models for Computer Supported Cooperative Work

 o Development and Evolution Support for ICIS

 o Human-Machine and Human-Human Cooperations through ICIS

 o Generalizable Application Experiences with ICIS

Who Should Attend
=================

Due to the relatively wide spectrum of themes addressed in the ICICIS,
a number of candidate participant groups can be identified from the
commercial and academic worlds.  Attendees will acquire knowledge of
the state-of-the-art in ICIS (the introduction of artificial
intelligence methods in information systems integration though
cooperation).  Groups who will benefit from attending the conference
include:

 o Technical Managers who face the problems of identifying the key
   technology required for developing corporate information management
   strategies within companies.

 o Technical staff interested in learning about solutions to
   integration problems faced in a variety of 'real-life' applications.

 o People from academia who are working in the forefront of theoretical
   and/or technical developments that are related to intelligent
   cooperative information systems.

 o Students wishing to gain a deep understanding of the way in which AI
   techniques might be introduced in distributed information management 
   systems.

                Prof. John Mylopoulos
                University of Toronto
                Canada
"Towards a Theory of Intelligent Cooperative Information Systems:
 Information Repositories and Information Agents"

Professor Mylopoulos will elaborate on possible ways of developing the
technology of Intelligent Information Systems.  He will present two
solutions, one based on large (possibly preexisting) passive Information
Repositories and the other based on small, flexible Information Systems
playing the role of specialized agents.
 
May 13, 1993
                Prof. Matthias Jarke
                Technical University of Aachen
                Germany
"Three Aspects of Intelligent Cooperation in the Quality Cycle."

Professor Matthias Jarke will discuss how ICIS can assist in the quest
for total quality management throughout the product life-cycle in
computer-integrated manufacturing environments.  Issues including
communication/cooperation among heterogeneous resources will be
addressed in the context of a real-life industrial application.

TUTORIAL DESCRIPTION
====================

"Interoperable Information Systems:
Motivations, Status, Challenges, and Approaches"

Michael L. Brodie
GTE Laboratories, Incorporated, U.S.A

The vision of future information systems (ISs) is compelling. It
involves large numbers of heterogeneous, intelligent agents distributed
over large computer/communication networks.  Tasks will be executed by
agents acting autonomously, cooperatively, or collaboratively, depending
on the resources required to complete the task (e.g., monitoring many
systems of a patient or many stations in a factory). Agents will request
and acquire resources (e.g., processing, knowledge, data) without
knowing what resources are required, how to acquired them, or how they
will be orchestrated to achieve the desired result. A goal of this
vision is to be able to use, efficiently and transparently, all
computing resources, particularly ISs, that are available on computers
in large computer/communications networks.

As compelling as the vision may be, problems of legacy systems (i.e.,
existing systems often developed using, now ancient, technology) are
more so, and are certainly more immediate. No matter how great the
vision, it will be of little value if it cannot be integrated into the
current IS technology base. Milions of currently disjoint ISs/computing
resources must be made to cooperate efficiently and transparently.
Without cooperation and increased intelligence, the dramatic benefits
and massive investments in currently disjoint computing resources may be
lost. For example, do you incorporate, into a organisation's new
distributed computing architecture, a mission critical, multi-million
dollar, multi-million line COBOL system with all its faults and
limitations, or simply replace it with a newly re-written system? There
is strong evidence that such legacy systems cannot be re-written. In the
IS world, demand for new systems and enhancements is outpacing available
resources.  Maintenance consumes almost all resources, with little left
for new development or major enhancements. A challenge here is to
develop technology that permits continuous enhancement and evolution of
the current, massive investment in ISs.

This vision is well on its way to reality. There are a large number of
national and international consortia, guidelines, and standards that
support initial responses to these requirements. The major software
vendors have all announced their support of, and initial products for,
distributed computing goals, including:

# Open systems (i.e., standard interfaces and architectures)
# Client-server computing (with low-cost workstation MIPS)
# Distributed computing (including distributed DBMSs)
# Advanced flexible user interfaces
# Transparent multi-vendor interoperability
# Transaction processing
# Structured organisation of corporate resources/components
# Reliability and maintainability
# Reduced communication costs
# Single-point program maintenance and upgrading

ICIS underly these advances and challenges.  This tutorial provides a
practical, intuitive, and conceptual understanding of interoperability
in terms of case studies (legacy systems), a vision of the future,
current trends / approaches, and research challenges. It provides a road
map of the new area of interoperability as a basis for understanding
ICIS.  It addresses such trendy topics as:

# Distributed Computing Architectures and Middleware
# The Repository
# Process Re-Engineering
# Re-Use and Reverse Engineering
# Corporate Information Repositories
# Enterprise Information Architectures and Integration
# Legacy System Migration / Evolution
# Distributed Databases
# Transaction Processing and Monitors
# Object-Orientation
# Gateways
