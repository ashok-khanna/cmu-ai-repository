  AAAI Workshop on Cooperation among Heterogeneous Intelligent Systems
 to be held at the Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence

I. Description

The purpose of this workshop, which is being held for the second
consecutive year during the National Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI), is to bring together researchers who are studying
ways to enable a heterogeneous collection of independent intelligent
systems to cooperate in solving problems requiring their combined
expertise.  Heterogeneous intelligent systems can differ in their
internal structures, capabilities, and purposes.  Customary AI systems
are developed to stand alone, and so are not equipped to reason about
how and when to cooperate in solving problems beyond their individual
scopes.  This workshop will address issues and techniques for overcoming
current limitations, including limitations in supporting collaboration
among collections of AI and human problem solvers.  It will focus on how
to develop tools for supporting cooperation among heterogeneous
intelligent systems and shells for building cooperative knowledge-based
systems.

II. Topics

Among the workshop's principal topics of interest are:

1. Studies of the types of cooperation and negotiation that can be
achieved by heterogeneous systems.

2. Knowledge-level analyses of the components that belong to such
systems, and formalisms for representing this knowledge.

3. Architectures and frameworks for combining independent AI systems to
enable them collectively to solve more complex problems.

4. Issues related to the integration of heterogeneous database systems
as information providers in problem-solving environments.

5. Intelligent computer environments that facilitate cooperation among
people of diverse abilities during a problem-solving process, including
developments in intelligent groupware systems.

III. Format

Our goal this year is to continue promoting a dialogue between
researchers exploring the use of technology to enhance human cooperation
and researchers studying cooperation among AI systems.  This year,
instead of paper presentations, we plan to present and analyze results
through a series of panel discussions.  Each panel will comprise authors
of selected papers and will be led by a member of the workshop's
organizing committee.  We expect to have panels on topics such as
negotiation, architectures, and degrees of cooperation.

IV. Attendance

Workshop attendance will be limited to about 40 people.  Attendance will
be by invitation only.  Prospective attendees will be expected to submit
either a full-length paper (maximum 10 pages) or a single page
description of their research interests and how they relate to the
workshop's topics.  Approximately 20 of the prospective attendees will
be panelists.

The organizing committee will be looking for papers with previously
unpublished results.  We will strive for an equal mix of papers that
describe theoretical results and applications.

V. Submission Requirements

Submit four copies of an extended abstract (5-8 pages) by March 13,
using 12 pt font and 8.5" x 11" page size.  Abstracts should be sent in
hard copy form.  Final papers are limited to a maximum of 10 pages in
length, 12 pt font and 8.5" x 11" page size, not including references
and figures.  A set of working notes will be produced and then
distributed during the workshop.

VI. Submission Deadline: March 13, 1992.

VII. Notification date: April 3, 1992.

VIII. Final date for camera-ready copies: April 17, 1992.
