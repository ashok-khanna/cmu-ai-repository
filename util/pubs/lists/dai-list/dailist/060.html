                          BLACKBOARD PARADIGM AND
                             ITS APPLICATIONS

             A Special Issue of EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DESCRIPTION

The blackboard model is widely recognized as a powerful framework for
building knowledge-based systems.  The model has been recognized as
being particulary useful in situations involving the need for
opportunistic and incremental problem solving strategies.  The
blackboard paradigm can be viewed as a natural evolution of expert
system technology.  The blackboard model is an important approach in
artificial intelligence, and has been generating interest among a varied
set of researchers.  The power and utility of the blackboard model is
just being realized.  Therefore, EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS plans
to publish a special issue on the blackboard model and its applications
in 1993.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Papers dealing with issues related to the blackboard paradigm and/or the
development of blackboard systems are appropriate.

The topics include, but are not limited to the following:

- Organization and Control
- Advanced Architectures
- Real-time Systems
- Development Environments
- Novel Applications
- Validation and Verification

Paper describing actual implementations (prototypes or actual
systems) are particularly welcome.

IMPORTANT DATES

MAY 1, 1992:        Full paper due (5 Copies)
JULY 1,1992:        Notice of review results
AUGUST 15,1992:     Final paper due

SUBMISSION

One page abstracts may be sent (are not required) prior to May 1 if
authors are concerned about the relevancy of the paper to the special
issue.  These abstracts will be reviewed by only the guest editors.
Full paper submissions will follow the standard refereeing process.
Interested contributors should submit five (5) copies of their
manuscripts to one of the guest editors.

Subject: post-doctoral position

   ************** Postdoctoral Position Available ****************
   ******** in NTT's Cooperative Problem Solving Project *********

NTT Communication Science Laboratories were established as the 12th
laboratories of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation on July 4,
1991.  These laboratories are currently in the ATR building, which
has a very international atmosphere and is located approximately
30 minutes by train from Japan's old capitals, Kyoto and Nara.  

The main goal of NTT Communication Science Laboratories is to contribute
to the advances in computer and communication science through basic
research undertaken with a long range view.  In particular, many
distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) topics are being investigated.

We invite applications for a postdoctoral position on the cooperative
problem solving project. The ideal candidate will have rich experience
in DAI, planning, or in mobile robots.  Researchers with a robotics
background are highly welcome.  The position is available from April
1992, or later, and is guaranteed for a one-year period, but this can be
extended by mutual agreement.  Candidates must have a Ph.D. prior to
accepting this position.

The postdoctoral position is crucial for the cooperative problem solving
project, which will consist of four researchers.  The postdoctoral
fellow will participate in major research decisions and share duties
including the design and development of a prototype system, and the
publications resulting from the project.

Our research activities and the detailed conditions of the postdoctoral
position are available upon request.  Interested persons should please

TITLE:  Implementing MASE (Management and Security Experts) 
	Using PCLIPS (A Parallel C Language Inference
        Production System)

ABSTRACT:

     PCLIPS is a set of extensions to the CLIPS expert- system language
developed at JSC NASA.  Written in C and using native TCP/IP, PCLIPS is
portable to most platforms and has been tested on Unix (System V and
BSD), VAX VMS, and Apollo Domain OS.   The PCLIPS extensions include:
an object-oriented communication package, a mechanism for automated
expert system configuration, a truth-maintenance system, an alarm-timing
mechanism, an environment-preservation system, and a set of command-line
arguments for behavior control.

     We are developing the MASE (Management and Security Experts) system
on top of PCLIPS.  MASE is a set of distributed expert systems that
monitor operating system and network resources on a heterogeneous
network.  The expert systems can act in either an advisory or
supervisory mode.   In an advisory mode, the expert systems will notify
the system manager of problems, and make suggestions as to how to
correct them.  In a supervisory mode, the expert systems can take
corrective actions to fix problems long before a human expert (the
system manager) would be able to.  MASE can also monitor known security
holes for indications of an intruder or a virus.

Subject: This Wednesday 10/16/91, TACART: Landauer on Wrappings
Date: 14 Oct 91 06:31:45 GMT

Los Angeles (LA) Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
Technical Activity Committee on Artificial Intelligence (TACART)

TOPIC:       Knowledge-Based Software Integration Techniques

SPEAKER:     Dr. Christopher A. Landauer, The Aerospace Corp.
DATE:        Wednesday, 16 October, 1991.

ABSTRACT:    The flexible use of software to achieve widely
             differing user goals requires the intelligent
             application and combination of resources. This talk 
             will focus on "wrappings" - "expert" interfaces to
             programs, algorithms, tools, and other resources in
             the environment. It will describe the structure of
             a program, vsim, that supports the wrapping paradigm.

             Computer Systems Research Department of The Aerospace 
             Corporation.  His publications include papers on validation 
             of expert systems, the use of mathematical tools in expert 
             systems, high-level simulation modeling, statistical
