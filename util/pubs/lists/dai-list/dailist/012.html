Subject: pre- and postdoc positions in DAI research

The Daimler-Benz Research Institute Berlin offers part-time jobs for
students as well as pre- and postdoc positions within the long-term
project COSY. This project, among others, aims at a methodology for
cooperating knowledge-based systems.

The tasks to accomplish are both conceptual design and practical
implementations: 
- select, develop, implement, test, and evaluate concepts for control
and communication for cooperation
- expand our testbed
- demonstrate cooperating techniques on applications.

We expect familiarity with basic approaches in DAI for the
concept-oriented problems and experience with LISP and object-oriented
programming for the implementation-oriented problems.

Our Institute provides an excellent environment to pursue
interdisciplinary research in various areas of information technology,
which include parallel computing, neural nets, software verification,
safety and fault tolerance.

people as well as for an application, please contact
