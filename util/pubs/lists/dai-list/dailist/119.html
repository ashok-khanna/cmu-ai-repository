Subject: Query on 'DAI development methods'
Date: Fri, 7 May 93 10:58:37 +0200

I'm doing an investigation in DAI development methodologies:  I'm
interested in work that calls itself a "methodology", but also in any
other work that provides some guidance on how
  "domain-problem features are mapped to DAI solutions"

I have found some related work:
1. Reports on the CONSENSUS methodology, (a project in the UK) that
   combined real-time s/w engineering with communicating blackboards.
2. A paper (in the Expert Systems '92 - BCS conference) from Ovalle
   and Gabbay, that describes such a methodology
3. Work from Wooldridge and O'Hare (UMIST) in Avignon '91, where
   they report a case study with methodological implications.
4. The COSY project (Sundermeyer et al.) that (I think) appeared in a
   poster session at Keele '90.
5. Examples of other work which is not a methodology but cannot be
   ignored because its extensive testing produced principles,
   is the FA/C line of work (starting from (Erman/Lesser 80)
   and continuing)

Questions:
- Are you aware of any other efforts that have escaped my attention
(particularly in the US)?
- Do you know of any (available) publications of 1 and 4? Any new
developments of 2 and 3? Any important work that you feel should not
be missed in 5?
Please mail to me, georgios.lekkas@cen.jrc.it, and I will summarize to
the list.  I'm doing this query because journals and on-line databases
may take several years to archive material.

Thank you
George Lekkas

Subject: knowledge reuse
Date: Fri, 30 Apr 93 17:11:21 GMT

I'm looking for information on the state of affairs in knowledge reuse.
E.g., there were two articles in the fall '91 issue of AI magazine, and
I've seen oblique references to it in some articles by BNR.

Is this topic going anywhere?  The reason I'm asking is that there is a
working group being formed here to develop guidelines for (among other
things) sharing knowledge bases among organizations, which aims to
decouple applications from propietary technology (e.g., shells).  I'm
really skeptical about the prospects for accomplishing anything useful
when expert system techniques are in such a rapid state of change.  I
would really appreciate hearing the wisdom of this news group.

Thanks,
