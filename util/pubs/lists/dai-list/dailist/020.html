To the DAI community:

I have discovered, rather late, that for the past two years I have been
engaged in DAI research. I look forward to attending future meetings.
Until then, I will be happy to send those interested a copy of a
technical report summarizing our work on Agent-Oriented Programming. You
can request it either electronically or physically.

Title: Agent Oriented Programming

Abstract:
A new computational framework is presented, called agent-oriented
programming, which can be viewed as a specialization of object-oriented
programming.  The state of an agent consists of components called
beliefs, choices, capabilities, commitments, and possibly others; for
this reason the state of an agent is called its mental state.  The
mental state of agents is captured formally in an extension of standard
epistemic logics:  beside temporalizing the knowledge and belief
operators, AOP introduces operators for commitment, choice, and
capability.  Agents are controlled by agent programs, which include
primitives for communicating with other agents.  In the spirit of
speech-act theory, each communication primitive is of a certain type:
informing, requesting, offering, and so on.  The paper presents the
concept of AOP, explores formal aspects of mental state, and defines a
simple agent language called AGENT0.
