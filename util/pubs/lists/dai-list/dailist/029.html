DPS (Distributed Problem Solving) is a term used as a shorthand way of
referring to a diverse set of concerns about supporting multiple
individuals working together to solve one or more common problems.  The
more and longer investigations are performed on how cooperative problem
solving is performed, the more it becomes evident that cooperative
decision making is the crucial point in DPS (Lesser et al., 1987;
Sycara, 1989).  Productivity of groups can only be enhanced, if the work
context, i.e., knowledge processing as well as interaction procedures
using common knowledge in a decision-making process, can be modelled in
a comprehensive way (Bullen et al., 1990).  Thus, incorporating decision
support into problem solving environments has at least to deal with:
cooperation (concerning communication capabilities, roles and
organization of work), concurrent events, and shared knowledge
(concerning the common problem as well as decision procedures).

To cope with the diversity of issues and their integration for the
development of models, several disciplines have already contributed
concepts and formalisms for cooperative decision making:  Organizational
Science (e.g., Huber, 1984), Artificial Intelligence (AI) (e.g., Huhns,
1987), Office Automation (e.g., Conklin et al., 1988), Operations
Research (e.g., Jarke et al., 1987), and Computer Supported Cooperative
Work (CSCW) (e.g., Malone, 1988).

In the following we investigate in how far existing approaches model
decision support in distributed cooperative environments
comprehensively.


INFORMATION SHARING
-------------------

Information sharing support is a term which summarizes all approaches
covering basic activities for argument exchange in decision making (i.e.
messages, tasks, etc.):

Object Typing
-------------

Henderson et al., 1986 enabled users of Rooms to create local sets of
objects to protect them from overload and to allow individual
environments. Although the system has been used for desktop objects its
concept for structuring shared workspaces shows a way to focus attention
on persuasion, dialogue and negotiation.

An concept of high originality for structuring information spaces was
developed by Halasz et al., 1987.  They encoded the foci of work by
index cards, which can be easily linked and cross-referenced.

Message Typing
--------------

To prevent information overload and to support structured cooperation,
Information Lens (Malone et al., 1987) uses (group-defined) message
types. They are used to provide meta-information on messages.  The
system routes and selects messages according to the needs of group
members. Thus, the emergence of conventions among agents is supported.

Task Typing
-----------

For Co-Authoring Muse (Hodges et al., 1989) supports cooperation by four
different representation schemes, including directed graphs, declarative
constraints, and procedural descriptions.  For specialized groups
problem-specific languages can be created.


NEGOTIATION SUPPORT
-------------------

Negotiation support tools have been designed to provide quantitative
support of decision processes by validation of values indicating success
resp.  failure of exchanged arguments for persuasion:

Application of Game Theory
--------------------------

Whenever game theory has been incorporated into interaction models, the
strategic behaviour of agents has been characterized, e.g., by
introducing types of rational activities.  Game theory applications
assume concurrent common knowledge, i.e.  interaction within continuous
environments.  For example, Rosenschein et al., 1985 assume a payoff
matrix to be concurrent common knowledge.  This assumption is based on
the belief that agents are always willing to cooperate.  Since this
assumption is somewhat unrealistic, it can be overridden by
approximating preferences of agents.

- Debate modelling

Debates are commonly understood as the exchange of arguments along of
semantic links among agents.  For instance, in gIBIS (Conklin et al.,
1988), a hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussions, the
underlying model of argument exchange is based on the representation of
internal structures of design decisions as well as high level
dependencies which grow up among agents:

	-  Each problem has to be defined by one or more key issues.

	-  Each issue can have many position statements. A position
	   statement is a statement or an assertion resolving the issue.
	   Positions may exclude each other.

	-  Each position may have one or more arguments which support
	   the position or object to it.

For each issue there exists a tree whose root node is constituted by an
issue.  The root's children are position statements.  The children of
positions are arguments.  A variety of links, e.g., 'responds-to'
between position and issue, allows to trace and represent argument
exchange.

In summary, negotiation support can be achieved by quantification of
arguments, by application of game-theoretical strategies, and by
providing semantical links between predefined entities of argument
exchange (i.e., position statement, issue, and argument).  With the
exception of game theory applications, there exists no stop condition
resp.  a way of recognizing that an issue has been resolved by agreement
upon some position statement.


INTERACTION AMONG RATIONAL AGENTS
---------------------------------

Multiagent interaction research is traditionally focused on planning,
because cooperation has been identified as aggregation of understanding,
planning, and reasoning (Durfee, 1988).  Debate modeling has been
primarily modeled as goal-oriented:

Goals and Protocols
-------------------

The first approach to argumentation modeling can be considered to be the
Contract Net model introduced by Smith, 1980. Its intended goal was the
automation of agents' behavior with respect to negotiations.  Agents
should be able to communicate their specific desires (goals) and
compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreements. The protocols used
in Contract Nets ``generate considerable communication overhead''
(Huhns, 1987) because they are based on government contract awarding
setup. Negotiation was understood as one agent announcing the
availability of tasks and awarding them to other bidding agents.

-  Economic Extensions

Further developments, e.g., Malone et al., 1988 refine the Contract Net
approach by overlaying them with a more sophisticated economic model,
where optimality unter certain conditions can be proven. In addition,
agents are not assumed to act autonomously. In the authors' view, task
sharing algorithms have to be specified by a proper language.

-  Cognitive Extensions

Sycara, 1989 elaborated the motivational aspects from Malone et al.,
1988.  She modelled cognitive aspects of negotiations.  Her work is
based on the assumption that information resp.  argument exchange within
negotiations constitutes successful multiagent interaction, originally
assumed by Durfee, 1988.  Since cognitive events may change, interaction
behaviour cannot be specified in advance by static models.

In considering interaction as a game of strategies each agent within
multiagent environments only has partial control over the consequences
of his/her/its activities (Galliers, 1988}. To take into account partial
autonomy of agents they are characterized by goals and beliefs. To
represent relationships between goals and beliefs, 'preferences' have
been defined. In addition, 'interests' denote goals which the agent not
only believes to be achievable but which he/she/it believes will
eventually be achievable. Interaction among agents is determined by
exchanging statements which are based on goals, beliefs, interests and
preferences. Conflicts in interaction concern either goals or beliefs.
Negotiations are defined as situations where arguments have to be
exchanged for conflict resolution. In case of no conflicts, situations
are called cooperative. In any case, arguments are generated by an
agent, which has a belief that the addressed agent(s) has (have) a
certain goal.

Plans
-----

To increase cooperative behaviour, Sycara, 1989 introduced the term of
persuasive argumentation which denotes a mechanism that achieves
convergence towards a global solution by purposefully modifying plans,
goals and the behaviour of other agents.  Negotiation is considered to
be a ``planning process for coordinating not fully cooperative agents''
(Sycara, 1989).  Persuasive argumentation is based on the assumption
that negotiation is that kind of interaction which ensures the
willingness to cooperate with other agents.  Thus, communicated
information is used to convince agents to cooperate.  To perform that
task, an agent has to reason about another agent to modify its own
intentions and plans.  Agents are represented by belief structures
containing goals and their attached importance.  The belief structure is
mapped to an acyclic graph, which is searched and updated during
negotiations.  Each argument is used within a negotiation strategy to
achieve certain goals.  Beyond that, the concept of preference
structures represents an agent in terms of selections among future
alternatives and past activities.  Each alternative is evaluated in
terms of a number of attributes that an agent considers to be important.
The resulting set of attributes is called 'utility'.


Apparently, neither pure goal-oriented approaches nor their extensions
allow comprehensive representation of (concurrent) collaborations and
decision making.

EVALUATION
----------

The existing models are more or less comprehensive. Logic-based
approaches, e.g., by modeling beliefs, as well as information processing
models do not comprise common knowledge, collaborative activities, and
decision processes in distributed problem solving.  Conventional, i.e.,
non-AI approaches to model cooperation are focussed on structuring
information based on clustering resp. message typing.  They handle
cooperation implicitly by providing problem-oriented contexts which has
to be made explicit for specification of knowledge in distributed
problem solving environments.  To enhance transparency, dynamic entities
like processes have to include the required information to identify
shared knowledge, the status of the decision making process and the
role(s) of agents.  Such a comprehensive model allows us to overcome
particular shortcomings which we have found in current approaches:

1. Histories concerning agents, messages, and roles cannot be accessed.
Thus, tracing interactions is not possible.

2. Temporal constraints cannot be specified in terms of
(in)consistencies of shared information in the strength of centralized
control.  Thus, the knowledge of a problem solver at a certain time
cannot be specified explicitly.

3. Once a common context is achieved, it cannot be adapted to the status
of the collaborative problem solving process.  There are no mechanisms
to adapt the representation of cooperative distributed problem solving
processes according to organizational needs.

4. Intentions, beliefs and/or attitudes, like the unwillingness to
collaborate, cannot be the basic assumptions for modeling cooperative
decision making. Rather they are considered higher categories of social
behaviour, which are not primarily problem-oriented and thus, have to be
modeled after modeling basic communication acts like information
exchange.

Alternative approaches, such as process-oriented agent-to-agent
communication seem to be promising, but have to be elaborated to
determine their usability for comprehensive modeling of problem solving
in distributed environments.
