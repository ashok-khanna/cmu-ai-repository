Subject: DAI Event at AI Olympics

Due to the great popularity and success of the Robot Olympics held at
the recent AAAI Conference in San Jose, California, there has been a
preliminary discussion of including additional events at future AAAI or
IJCAI Conferences, such as

* a natural-language understanding event, in which participants would
  test the ability of their NLU software to read and answer questions
  about a simple story (1st or 2nd grade level)

* a DAI or multiagent event, in which ...?

Well, it is up to us, the DAI research community, to define what this
event should be.  To start a discussion of this, here is my suggestion:

                 "The Cooperation Competition"

Each entry consists of one software agent that has expertise in domain
X.  Solving a problem in domain X requires the cooperation of two
agents, so two entries would perform at a time.  If the agents are able
to cooperate and solve the problem correctly, they both obtain a high
score.  If they fail to solve the problem, either due to lack of
cooperation or lack of sufficient expertise, they both obtain a low
score.  Each agent is paired with every other agent for solving the
problem, and its final score is the sum of its results from all
pairings.

Domain X must be a domain that can be simulated graphically, so that the
judges and audience can observe the competition.  It also must be a
domain that does not require an inordinate amount of expertise, because
we want the entrants to focus on their cooperation strategies, rather
than on the domain itself.  Here are some possibilities for such a
domain:

 * Furniture Moving - the agents must move a table from one room through
a doorway to another room.  Cooperation is required, because the table
can only be carried by two agents, one at each end.  (There are several
reasons why this is harder than it first seems: 1) because the table is
rigid, the agents must move it in the same direction at the same time,
or they must take turns moving their end in an arc centered at the
stationary agent; 2) the agents have to decide who goes to which end of
the table, because it does no good for them both to lift the same end;
3) the agents cannot both be at the same place at the same time and they
shouldn't collide when they move; 4) the agents cannot fit through the
doorway side-by-side, so they have to decide who goes first; and 5) the
 agents cannot both be leaders or both be followers.  Resolving some of
these might require a lot of discussion and coordination.)

* Planetary Exploration or Scavenger Hunt - the agents must locate a
number of objects hidden on a planet.  By cooperating, they should be
able to find the objects faster and more efficiently.

* Maze Exploration - by communicating and cooperating, two agents should
be able to explore a maze faster than either one individually.  Agents
would be scored on how fast they traversed the maze.

* Team vs. Team Capture (from Ed Durfee) - each entry is a team of
agents that cooperate with each other to capture their opponents' agents
by surrounding them.  Points are awarded for each capture.

Whatever the domain, we would need to specify a domain vocabulary and a
communication protocol

Please let DAI-List know if you have any ideas or opinions about this,
or if you might be interested in participating.

************************************************************
Second Multi-Agent and Cooperative Computing Workshop (MACC)
************************************************************

Japan Society for Software Science and Technology will hold its second
workshop on Multi-Agent and Cooperative Computing Workshop on December
9-11, 1992 at Rokko Sky Villa, Kobe, Japan.

The workshop covers the issues on multiagent and cooperative computing,
such as formal models and architectures of agents, cooperative computing
models/systems, social models/systems, agent autonomy and reflection,
modeling of communication and discourse, distributed planning, learning
in multiagent environment, and applications (robotics, simulation,
network/distributed system management, etc.).

The first workshop was held in 1991 in Shizuoka, Japan. There were 24
presentations and approximately 50 participants.  The presentations at
the workshop were mostly in Japanese, but we don't discourage
presentations in English.

       SEMINAR AND BRIEFING AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
                   THURSDAY, JULY 16TH

Presentation by Dr. Richard Adler, Director of Advanced Development,
Symbiotics Inc.

"A Communications Substrate for the DRN Distributed Blackboard"

Abstract

The US/CIS Scientific Interface Project is developing a distributed
blackboard architecture to support its automated information management
system for reviewing Russian scientific research proposals.  This system
will integrate and coordinate intelligent programs that translate,
abstract, and evaluate proposals.  The blackboard architecture will
require capabilities for distributed communication to link these
applications, and human users, across computers connected by Local Area
Networks and across the Internet.  Communication capabilities are
constrained to be minimally intrusive to limit the effort required to
reengineer intelligent programs for integration.  Modularity is
important to facilitate refinements to blackboard coordination
protocols.  Finally, heterogeneous software and hardware platforms for
DRN elements must be supported.


Symbiotics has developed the NetWorks! software tool to address these
integration requirements.  NetWorks! enables programs written with
different languages or development tools to be connected across a
network of disparate computers and operating systems.  Briefly,
developers use NetWorks! to construct objects called Agents, which
provide predefined communication functions.  An application invokes a
local Agent to pass a message to an Agent on another networked computer
using a concise, high-level Application Programming Interface (API).
The target Agent unpacks the message, interacts with the desired
application (e.g., to inject a query or command), and returns results to
the sending Agent to pass back to the calling program.  Message-passing
is asynchronous and peer-to-peer.  Agents for the DRN system would
exchange messages containing blackboard protocols.  Such messages would
allow intelligent knowledge sources or human users to interact across
distributed blackboards.

This presentation will: (1) review NetWorks! architecture and
functionality; (2) discuss a high-level design for incorporating
NetWorks! into the proposed DRN distributed blackboard architecture;
(3) demonstrate NetWorks! on a LAN made up of heterogeneous computers.
