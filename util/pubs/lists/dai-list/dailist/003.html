Subject: DAI Papers at AAAI-90

The call for papers for AAAI-90 requires each submitted paper to specify
a single topic from a given list of Content Areas.  If you are planning
to submit a paper on distributed artificial intelligence (which,
unfortunately, is not one of the topics) please choose the topic
"Automated Reasoning" and include the additional keyword "DAI."  This
will 1) make it easier for the papers to be sorted for review, 2) group
DAI papers together so that they can be reviewed uniformly, 3) enable
papers on DAI to be reviewed by people knowledgeable abut DAI, and 4)
make it easier to arrange conference sessions devoted to DAI.  This
procedure has been agreed to by the AAAI-90 Program Chairs, Tom
Dietterich and Bill Swartout.

Note:  papers must arrive by February 20, 1990 at
AAAI-90
American Association for Artificial Intelligence
