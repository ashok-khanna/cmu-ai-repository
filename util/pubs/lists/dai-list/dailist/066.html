*************** VACANCIES FOR MULTIAGENT AI RESEARCHERS *******************
***************** AT SHARP LABORATORIES OF EUROPE LTD. ********************
****************************** OXFORD, UK *********************************
***************************************************************************

Sharp Laboratories of Europe, the new European research subsidiary of
the Sharp Corporation, is expanding its Distributed Intelligent Systems
(DIS) team through the addition of one or more Researchers.  Our mission
is to perform forward looking research, developing innovative techniques
to be used within future generations of Sharp products.  This
appointment represents an outstanding opportunity to join a significant
venture near the start of its life.

The DIS team is conducting basic research in multiagent artificial
intelligence applied to office computer networks.  Software development
is in Quintus Prolog and Poplog on Sun SPARCStations.

Candidates should have a good first degree plus at least 2-3 years
genuine research experience in multiagent AI or a closely related
subject.  They should combine intelligence, imagination, flexibility and
drive, with an ability to communicate in writing and verbally.  The
ideal candidate would be a European citizen with a recent PhD.

SLE is currently located in Abingdon, an attractive market town just
outside Oxford.  We will be moving to a purpose built laboratory on the
new Oxford Science Park very shortly.  The laboratory is well-equipped
and the working conditions are pleasant.  Salaries are highly
competitive with UK industry and universities, and relocation assistance
is available.

Apply, quoting two referees and enclosing a recent research paper, to:

Subject: OC3 Conference Announcement

Third Conference on Organizational Computing, Collaboration and
Coordination

Supported by the Center for Information Systems Management U.T. Austin,
IC2 Institute U.T. Austin, MCC, NCR Corporation, and the RGK Foundation

The conference will be held at The University of Texas at Austin's IC2
Institute in Austin, Texas, February 23-25, 1992.  A tentative program
and registration materials are enclosed.

The first OC3 Conference was held in October 1989 with about 100 people
in attendance.  The second conference was held in February 1991 and
about 150 people attended. The papers presented at the first conference
were published by Ablex of Norwood, New Jersey as special issues of the
new journal "Organizational Computing." The papers presented at the
second conference are forthcoming in "Organizational Computing.  Papers
presented at the forthcoming conference will also be published in a
future issue of the same journal. Information about the journal is
included at the end of this flier.

As in the past, the conference will explore the integration of CSCW
with other disciplines, such as economics, distributed systems, and
organization theory. A special emphasis will be placed on application
to organizational tasks, such as auditing, and customer support in a
client server computing environment. A panel on the possibilities of
using virtual reality and cyberspace to support business activities
will also be held.

The conference registration fee of $150 covers the opening reception on
Sunday, breakfast and lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and a banquet at MCC
on Monday. Software demonstrations of the MCC Coordination system will
be made before the banquet at MCC. Included in the registration fee are
conference materials and ground transportation to and from the
conference site.

If you have any questions regarding the conference program, please call
me at 512-471-8879.  For questions regarding conference registration
and logistics, please call the RGK Foundation at 512- 474-9298.

Arrangements for discounted airline fares are being made with
