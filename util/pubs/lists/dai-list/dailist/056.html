Subject: Third OC3 conference

Third Conference on Organizational Computing, Collaboration and
Coordination

Supported by the Center for Information Systems Management U.T. Austin,
IC2 Institute U.T. Austin, MCC, NCR Corporation, and the RGK Foundation

The conference will be held at The University of Texas at Austin's IC2 
Institute in Austin, Texas, February 23-25, 1992.  A tentative program 
and registration materials are enclosed.

The first OC3 Conference was held in October 1989 with about 100 people
in attendance.  The second conference was held in February 1991 and
about 150 people attended. The papers presented at the first conference
was published by Ablex of Norwood, New Jersey as special issues of the
new journal "Organizational Computing." The papers presented at the
second conference are forthcoming in "Organizational Computing.  Papers
presented at the forthcoming conference will also be published in a
future issue of the same journal. Information about the journal is
included at the end of this message.

As in the past, the conference will explore the integration of CSCW with
other disciplines as economics, distributed systems, and organization
theory.  A special emphasis will be placed on application to
organizational tasks as auditing, and customer support in a client
server computing environment. A panel on the possibilities of using
artificial reality to support business activities will also be held.

The conference registration fee of $150 covers the opening reception on
Sunday, breakfast and lunch on Monday and Tuesday, and a banquet at MCC
on Monday. Software demonstrations of the MCC Coordination system will
be made before the banquet at MCC. Included in the registration fee are
conference materials and ground transportation to and from the
conference site.

If you have any questions regarding the conference program, please call
me at 512-471-8879.  For questions regarding conference registration and
logistics, please call the RGK Foundation at 512-474-9298.

Arrangements for discounted airline fares are being made with American
Airlines. Details of this arrangement will be shortly available. A block
of rooms at the Radisson has also been booked. Rooms will be available
at the conference rate of $65.

We look forward to your participation in this conference.
