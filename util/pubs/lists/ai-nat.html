(Apologies if you're seeing this again - the original version doesn't seem
to have gotten out, possibily resulting from posting to multiple moderated
newsgroups)

Following on a very successful workshop on applications of Artificial 
Intelligence techniques to natural World problems at the Australian AI'93
conference, a mailing list has been established to keep people in this area
in touch with each other. 

The list is intended to cover aspects of the application of artificial
intelligence techniques to domains involving the natural World. Without
being prescriptive, artificial intelligence would cover such areas as 
expert systems, knowledge representation, reasoning, learning, planning etc.
Likely natural World domains include natural resource management, mining, 
water resources, defence, development planning and so on (agriculture would
also fall within the area, but there is already a list covering agricultural
expert systems). 

Areas for discussion include technical issues of such applications; 
social and managerial issues in the introduction of AI technologies; and
a focus on the special technological needs of natural World systems, 
hopefully providing useful feedback into the AI research effort. The list
is also available for such items as conference announcements, calls for 
papers, and in general any announcements of interest to the reading community.

If you would like to subscribe, send a message to:

containing the line
	subscribe ai-nat <your email address>
the welcome message in reply will give you full details about use of the
mailing list.
