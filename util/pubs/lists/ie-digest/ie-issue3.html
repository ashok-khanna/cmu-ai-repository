                        Call for Papers
                        Special issue on
    Qualitative Reasoning in Business, Finance, and Economics

Decision Support Systems is seeking papers for a special issue
on Qualitative Reasoning in Business, Finance, and Economics.
Reasoning tasks in financial domains often require using
knowledge that cannot be formulated quantitatively with
precision.  Qualitative reasoning has been shown to be a useful
technique in Artificial Intelligence programs for formulating
and solving physics problems in which information is imprecise.
These techniques show promise in dealing with similar
challenging problems in applications to intelligent decision
systems for business, finance, and economics.

Papers for the special issue are solicited dealing with tasks
such as analysis, explanation, diagnosis, and design.  Task
domains of interest include, but are not limited to, financial
assessment, auditing, going-concern evaluation, risk assessment,
trading, marketing, microeconomics, and financial planning.

All papers will be reviewed according to the usual procedures
followed by Decision Support Systems.  Deadline for submission
of papers is July 1, 1993.  Submit five copies of each
manuscript to one of the following guest editors:

Hello!

I do not know the literature in the area of economic modeling.
I am looking for the names of journals that would be publishing
articles of this type. Specifically, I am looking for models
that use connectionist or cellular automata constructs to develop
their work.

If you could send the journal name, as well as the publisher
or some method by which to contact them for a subscription, I 
would appreciate it!

                        Cheers!

                            - R

Subject: The official UK Treasury Model ...


... is discussed by Robert Chote in "The New Scientist",
issue dated 31 Oct 1992, pages 26 to 31 inclusive.

It's a very readable paper, more like an article really,
and I recommend it to anyone interested in getting a
foothold in issues such as :-

  o  is economics a science or an art  ?
  o  why can't even sophisticated models not adequately model 
       human (i.e. consumer) behaviour  ?

It also introduces BVAR (Bayesian Vector Auto Regressive).
