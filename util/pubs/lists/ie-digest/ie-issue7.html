ANNOUNCING THE EVOLUTIONARY MODELS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE (EMSS) LIST

After 200 plus  requests for my bibliography on Evolutionary  Models in Social
Science, I  have managed to  set up a species  of mail/file server  for people
interested in this area. Anyone reading  this message who STILL hasn't had the
bibliography  should email  me again!  The software  is safe  - you  won't get
millions of bounces if you join - but it is not polished! You can subscribe to
the list by sending a message with  the string "subs-list" in the subject line
to  ECONEC@BLACK.OX.AC.UK  You  will  get  a  short  message  confirming  your
subscription and  providing more information about  the server. If  you don't,
mail me in  person. In addition the  latest copy of the  EMSS bibliography and
some accompanying notes can be retrieved from this site automatically.
 
Please let  me know  if you  need any help  with these  instructions or  if my
server is  screwing anything up where  you are. I am  rapidly discovering that
there are MANY sorts of mailer.
 
I have only subscribed manually those people who explictly asked me to do so:
 
Xiao Zhou, Soren Risbjerg Thomsen,  Timothy Van Zandt, Leslie DeGroff, Michael
Wellman, Jack Birner, Pradeep Philip, Graeme Faulkner, Howard Andrew Gutowitz,
Peter Treloar, Scott E Page, Carl Schmertmann, Penio Penev, Sushil Louis, Jack
Stecher, Philip Sharman, J J Merelo, Hadon Nash
 
Now that  this project looks  like really getting off  the ground -  there has
been far  more interest than I  envisaged - please  feel free to pass  on this
message to anyone else you think will  be interested. Many thanks to all those
who have offered help and encouragement so far :)
 
All the best,

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS FOR ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL COMPUTING

Scholars working in applications of the following fields to economics
and finance:

chaos theory,
self-organizing systems,
genetic algorithms,
fuzzy logic,
neural networks,

or in applications of  related fields are invited to submit abstracts of
research papers for a special issue of the journal Economic and
Financial Computing. This is a developmental project and will be carried
forward if there is sufficient interest. Please share this posting with
interested colleagues, e-mail contacts or mail lists where you believe
there may be interest in the issue. Abstracts may be sent by regular
mail to

Dr. Shawkat Hammoudeh
Dept. of Economics
Drexel University
Philadelphia, PA, 19104-2875

or by electronic mail to

Dr. Roger A. McCain
Dept. of Economics
Drexel University
Philadelphia, PA, 19104-2875
mccainra@dunx1.ocs.drexel.edu

Preliminary submissions are requested by 15 October 1993.

ANOTHER ECONOMIST USING GA's

Further to the list of economists using GAs in IE-List #6, I am also
using GAs in understanding strategic behaviour.  A paper in ICGA3 was
revised and published in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics (as
mentioned in Edmund Chattoe's bibliography).  I am now working on
using GAs to understand marketing strategies in the U.S. retail coffee
market.

BOOK ON EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

There is a book on evolutionary economics to which I would like to give a
hint at least:
 
        Ulrich Witt (ed.)
        Explaining Process and Change -- Approaches to Evolutionary Economics
        The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1992
 
In an article of mine therein you will find a link to Genetic or
Evolutionary Algorithms.

ERRATUM: OBTAINING REPORTS FROM THE SANTA FE INSTITUTE


In the last digest there was a post on Erhard Bruderer's papers on
GA's which gave Andi Sutherland as the contact person for obtaining
tech reports from the Santa Fe Institute. The person you should
actually contact is Patrisia Brunello (pdb@santafe.edu).

INVESTMENT DATA COLLECTION AT FTP SITE

Do you have some historical investment data you'd like to share with the
rest of the world? Stocks? Commodities? Mutual Funds? Investment
programs that one could not otherwise find out on the internet? Maybe
something (freely redistributable) you've downloaded off of a BBS? If
so, please FTP your files to the system below.  When doing so, please
try to pick meaningful filenames such as:
 
        nyse.1992.Z             Stock quotes for NYSE for 1992, compressed
        nyse.1992.Z.readme      A (required) readme file describing the file.
                                You may wish to include your E-Mail address in
                                this file.
 
Purpose:        To collect as much publicly available market data in one
                place so people can FTP it easily.
System:         dg-rtp.dg.com [128.222.1.2]
Login:          anonymous
Password:       yourusername@hostname
Directory:      pub/misc.invest
 
WARNING: ONLY *FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE* DATA IS ALLOWED ON THIS SITE!"!
         If you notice some data this is NOT freely redistributable,
         PLEASE send E-Mail to me telling me which file(s) you believe to
         be questionable.  Uploading copyrighted data to dg-rtp is a quick
         way to kill this FTP site - please don't do it.
 
In the misc.invest directory, feel free to make new directories and put
your contributions in it - especially if there are a large amount of
files.  Also, after adding something to the archive, please send me
E-Mail (savage@dg-rtp.dg.com) alerting me to what it is and if you'll
need write permission to that directory in the future.
 
If someone has something to contribute but they do not have FTP access,
feel free to E-Mail me (savage@dg-rtp.dg.com) the files along with a
README and I'll put them out there for you.
 
Thanks...

REQUEST FOR FTP DATA ON COMMODITIES

I am interested in receiving long-term daily price and volume data
for the S&P500, S&P100, and other commodity markets such as
gold, oil, etc.  I would like to known if there are FTP sites where I
can acquire this information.  Thanks.

issues and future directions.
 
This workshop invites original papers  which  represent  new
and  significant  research,  development and applications in
finance & investment and  which  cover  key  areas  of  time
series    forecasting,    multivariate   dataset   analysis,
classification and pattern recognition.
 
TOPICS
 
Full papers are  invited  in   (but  not  limited  to)   the
following areas:
 
 
- - Bond and Stock Valuation and Trading   - Univariate time series analysis
- - Asset allocation and risk management   - Multivariate data analysis
