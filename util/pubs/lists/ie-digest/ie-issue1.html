Subject: Scale invariance in Financial markets .


I would like  to know if  the idea  of invariance modulo  scale (temporal  and
others) is important in the Forecasting and modelling of Financial Markets. If
this is true, what techniques are avalaible  to cope with that ? Are  wawelets
specialists on line  with experience  on the  subject ?  Are more  traditional
linear techniques useful when there are temporal scale variations ? (ie Kalman
Filtering...)
Thanks for any information .
Ps: I am a novice in financial forecasting, being a specialist of neural
nets in vision.

Subject: Credit Monetary System Simulations

Credit Monetary System Simulation

We are investigating the behaviour of some models of endogenous
money. The models of money used are based on the insight that money
is essentially a credit instrument for low-cost transacting [1].
Monetary history seems to support this view, as we see the move from
gold-backed money, to fiat currency and to a hybrid of fiat and
bank money [2]. Homogenous electronic bank deposits and electronic
currency (using smart cards) represent a possible future evolutionary 
step in our modern monetary systems [3].

Endogenous credit money models encompass this future system better
than classical monetary models. Our simulations hope to gain
insights into the dynamic behaviour of these models, the optimal
institutional frameworks for their implementation, and decision criteria 
for credit money creation. 

Our simulation implementation faces issues such as how to model the
behaviour of its economic agents, their markets and trading patterns.
One approach we have been using is to use human players. The next more
practical step for extensive modelling will be to substitute artificial
agents. We would like to hear from others modelling artificial economies,
their aims and approaches. We have an extensive bibtex bibliography
and latex papers describing our project.

Subject: MBR as a relevant technique?

I just read the announcement of this list.

I wondered why more  symbolic AI techniques aren't  listed as relevant .  More
specifically, I know of  some research trying  to apply model-based  reasoning
and qualitative reasoning to financial and economical modeling.

And another one I missed is reinforcement learning.

Thanks in advance.

Here's a tidbit to start the list off, from the Tuesday, September
15, 1992 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle, page B1 (Business
Section), Herb Greenberg's column "Business Insider."  

"Total chaos: Last Tuesday, Michael Sarfatti of Fractal markets in San
Francisco faxed over some charts indicating that he called eight
market turns correctly in the past three months, based on a complex
mathematical theory known as chaos. 'It appears like it's about to
happen again,' he wrote at the time.  The 'it' he was talking about is
the market's tendency to make a significant move within a few days
after his computer flashes an alert.

"Since then the market has jumped 118 points."

average is at 1,173. ]
