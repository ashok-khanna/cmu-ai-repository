ICGA-93
				   
The Fifth International Conference on
  Genetic Algorithms
				   
17-21 July, 1993
University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign


The Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (ICGA-93), will be
held on July 17-21, 1993 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
 This meeting brings together an international community from academia,
government, and industry interested in algorithms suggested by the
evolutionary process of natural selection.  Topics of particular interest
include: genetic algorithms and classifier systems, evolution strategies,
and other forms of evolutionary computation; machine learning and
optimization using these methods, their relations to other learning
paradigms (e.g., neural networks and simulated annealing), and mathematical
descriptions of their behavior.  

The meeting will include pre-conference tutorials, invited speakers, and
workshops. 

A registration form is included below.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Location:  The conference will be held at two locations on the University
of Illinois campus--the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts located at
500 South Goodwin, Urbana, and the Levis Faculty Center located at 919 West
Illinois, Urbana (directly east of Krannert).  

ICGA '93 is a non-smoking conference.  Smoking is allowed in designated
areas only.

Transportation:   Champaign-Urbana is located 135 miles south of Chicago on
Interstates 72, 74, and 57.

By Car:
>From Chicago:  Take I-57 south to I-74 east which runs along the north edge
of Champaign-Urbana.  Take the Lincoln Avenue exit south.  Once you reach
campus, turn right on Illinois Street.  Campus Parking:  Pay parking is available in the lot adjacent to the Levis Faculty Center and
under the Krannert Center (both accessible from Illinois Street).  Do not
park in any area marked "reserved" as campus parking is enforced and you
will be towed.

By Air:
>From Champaign-Urbana's Willard Airport:
Currently, American Airlines' American Eagle Service, Trans World Express,
and US Air Express serve Willard Airport.  Corky's Limousine Service is
available and meets all incoming flights.  The cost from Willard to most
hotels in Champaign-Urbana is $8.  If you need to contact Corky's, you may
call 217/352-3121. 

By Train:
AMTRAK service is also available from Chicago and points south.    

Weather:  The weather in Illinois can vary to extremes.  Please be prepared
to dress in layered, cool clothing as July is normally hot (80 - 100 ) and
very humid.  Rain wear is also suggested.

On-Campus Recreation:  If you wish to take advantage of the recreation
facilities on campus, you may purchase an IMPE 
(Intramural-Physical Education) pass for $5 per day upon showing your name
badge at each recreation facility.   

Messages:  If someone needs to reach you during the conference, they may
call the Levis Faculty Center at 217/333-6241 and leave a message.  A
message board will be placed at this conference site.

Lodging:  Accommodations may be obtained at the following hotels/motels.  A
shuttle service will be available for 

transportation from your hotel to/from the conference sites.   All hotel
reservations should be made in advance by telephoning 
or writing the individual hotels.  Be sure to mention that you are
attending the Genetic 
Algorithms conference, as a block of rooms has been reserved for those
attending this conference.  We have listed the special conference rates
beside the hotel/motel.  Make your reservations early as the block of rooms
will be released for "first come, first serve" reservations after June 16,
1993.
