NEUROFORECASTING CLUB

The  UK's  Depratment  of  Trade  &  Industry  has  recently
anounced  a  Neural Computing Technology Transfer Programme.
The NEUROFORECASTING Club, part of the DTI's programme, aims
to  establish  an awareness of the neural network technology
amongst IT supliers,  banks,  multinational  companies,  and
financial  institutions  whose  needs  for  efficient  asset
management are of similar type.

The NEUROFORECASTING Club applies neural techniques to these
areas  of  financial  decision making and forecasting and is
building  application demonstrators in:

- -   foreign exchange & interest rate prediction,

- -   bond and stock valuation and trading,

- -   commodity price prediction,

- -   tactical asset allocation in the global capital markets

- -   risk and liability management in the above areas.

The management consortium for the NEUROFORECASTING Club is a
colloboration  between London Business School and University
College London.  The Club has established a centralised unit
at LBS which acts as a centre for developing the application
demonstrators; a  place  for  members  to  second  staff  to
participate   in   the  application  development  cycle;  to
maintain a "hands-on" area, to provide training  facilities,
organise seminars, etc.

Participation is open to any UK  Company,  Organisation,  or
Institution  which  are  potential  users  of neural network
systems, subject to their signing  the  Club  Agreement  and
paying the agreed contribution towards Club activities.

The NEUROFORECASTING Club is receiving DTI support at 50% of
total   cost,  approximately  $1  million  over  two  years.
Matching funds will be raised from membership contributions.

RESEARCH POSITIONS AT LBS

The Decision Science Faculty at the London  Business  School
welcomes  applications  from individuals for PhD Research or
Postdoctoral Fellowships.  Areas of particular  interest  to
the   group   include   decision   analysis,   optimisation,
forecasting,  simulation  and  the  application  of   neural
networks  to  investment  and  finance. PhD scholarships are
available from a number of corporate sponsors,  and  we  are
currently keen to support researchers interested in applying
(1) neural networks  to  time-series  forecasting   and  (2)
optimisation  and  decision  analytic methods to electricity
capacity  planning.  Potential  candidates  are  invited  to
write,  explaining research interests, together with c-v and
addresses of two references, to Professor Derek Bunn, London
Business  School,  Sussex  Place, Regennt's Park, London NW1
4SA.
