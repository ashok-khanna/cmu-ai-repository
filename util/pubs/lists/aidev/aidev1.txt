  News from around the world 
SUN MICROSYSTEMS SIGNS FIRST DISTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT IN AFRICA 
(OK, I know it's a bit out of date, but I just thought I'd start this
section and see if anyone had any news...)  
 
CASABLANCA, Morocco --May 9, 1990-- Sun Microsystems today announced
that it has appointed Casablanca-based Universal Computer as its first
distributor in Africa.  The agreement will allow Universal Computer to
distribute Sun's hardware and software products throughout Morocco.
Sun France, a subsidiary of the company, will oversee the relationship
with Universal Computer as well as all additional market development
for Sun in Africa. According to Sylvain Idy, distribution director for
Sun France,  "Universal Computer has the expertise to help us gain a
foothold in the  Moroccan market and will be a valuable partner as we
seek to establish  Sun's presence in Africa."  Universal Computer is a
leading distributor of high-technology products in Morocco.  The
company distributes computer hardware and application software,
primarily for CAD, GIS, architecture and commercial markets. According
to Mr. Moussaria, general manager of Universal Computer, "Sun's
arrival in Morocco represents a tremendous opportunity for computer
users in research, industry and management to access the best computer
technology." Idy estimates the size of the computer market in Africa
at approximately 500 million dollars for 1990.  As one of the more
industialized African countries, Morocco's demand for computer
products has increased roughly 25 percent annually, representing a
substantial opportunity for both Sun and Universal Computer. Sun
Microsystems, Inc., headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., is a
leading worldwide supplier of network-based distributed computing
systems, including professional workstations, servers and UNIX
operating system and productivity software.
