Subject:      Welcome to corpora list
Status: O

Welcome to the text corpora distribution list!

I hope that you will be able to share information, questions, answers,
programs etc. with the other members on the list.

The list is unmoderated, but if necessary, it may be moderated in the
future. It is not a LISTSERV list, the adresses are added/deleted
manually. Please send administrative messages to:
CORPORA-REQUEST@X400.HD.UIB.NO and not to the list.

The list will be logged on the machine nora.hd.uib.no, see below how
to access the log files.

It will be possible to upload files, either by mail to
corpora-request (text files and binhex/uuencoded files) or by FTP.
Files can also be sent on diskettes.

The list is hosted at the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities
in Bergen, Norway. Information stored at our machine nora.hd.uib.no
can be accessed in several ways:


FILESERV
========
 
The machine nora.hd.uib.no has been established as a mail
based server for the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities.
Information is grouped in different directories, some of which have
information in Norwegian only.
 
Some of the available directories:

corpora         Information from the distribution list CORPORA, log files etc.

icame           International Computer Archive of Modern English

info            Information on texts, projects etc., mostly in English

konferanser     Information on conferences

mac             Macintosh programs

ncch		Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities
		Information in English

nettinfo        Information on network resources, mostly in English

pc		MS-DOS programs

unix		Unix programs

The server is called FILESERV and runs the DECWRL archive server.
FILESERV accepts three types of commands; several commands can
be placed in the body of the mail message. However, the results will
be sent in one file, so do not request several large files in one
message. The commands are: 
 
Help                        Help file
Index                       Top level index
Index <directory>           Index for a directory
send <directory> <filename> Fetch a file in a directory
 
 
Example:
 
You want to get the index for the CORPORA and the KONFERANSER directories
and the file cogn-lin.kon in the KONFERANSER directory.
 
Send the following two notes ("index" and "send" commands cannot be put in the
same message, the "send" commands will then be ignored):

---------------- 

To:      fileserv@nora.hd.uib.no
Subject: whatever
 
index corpora 
index konferanser

----------------
 
To:      fileserv@nora.hd.uib.no
Subject: whatever
 
send konferanser cogn-lin.kon 
 
----------------

 
FTP SERVER 
==========
 
The files are also available via anonymous FTP from
nora.hd.uib.no (129.177.24.42).
 
To make use of this server, you must have access to a machine
connected to Internet with TCP/IP and a program running the FTP protocol.
 
Example:
 
To get the directories of the server write the following:

ftp nora.hd.uib.no
cd pub
dir
 
The server has a directory for uploading, this is writeable but not readable.

cd incoming
(binary)    (if transfer of programs or 8-bit data)
put xx-program.zip

Please send a note and a description to CORPORA-REQUEST if you upload
any files!

Other commands:
 
get <file>
mget <dir-mask> (to get several files, example: mget *.ex)
cd  <directory> (change directory)
cd ..           (up on level in the directory tree)
binary          (set binary transfer, for transfer of programs or 8-bit files)
ascii           (set transfer of 7-bit text data)


GOPHER SERVER
=============

The information is now also available through our Gopher server at
nora.hd.uib.no (port 70). If you are connected to the Internet (with
TCP/IP protocol), you can get client versions of Gopher for MS-DOS,
Macintosh and Unix. Gopher is a tree structured menu system and several
hundred servers are connected. 

Main menu on the nora.hd.uib.no machine:

Subject:      Wrongly directed messages
Status: O

 From the number of wrongly directed messages to "corpora" instead of
"corpora-request", as well as a message which tried to retrieve files
from "corpora" (i.e. treating "corpora" as a listserv), perhaps I could
help clarify the way the system has been set up, as I understand it:

(1) a message sent to "corpora@x400.hd.uib.no" gets forwarded to ALL members 
of the list i.e. everyone gets to read your message;

(2) a message sent to "corpora-request@x400.hd.uib.no" gets forwarded to 
the list administrator, presumably Knut;

(3) a message sent to "fileserv@nora.hd.uib.no" is the proper way to 
access the Nora fileserver.  The ftp number given in Knut's message
is the alternative to retrieving files from the Nora machine.

Hope this helps.

Due to some "noise" on the list, I am now inspecting mail to CORPORA
before it is resent, filtering out requests for joining etc. This will
mean that the turn-around time for messages will be about half a day. The
original sender will not figure in the From: field, so it will
not be possible to use the reply function of your mail program

========================================================================

WHAT IS THE OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE?

The Oxford Text Archive is a facility provided by Oxford
University Computing Services. It has no connexion with Oxford
University Press or any other commercial organisation and
exists to serve the interests of the academic community by
providing archival and dissemination facilities for
electronic texts at low cost.

The Archive offers scholars long term storage and
maintenance of their electronic texts free of charge. It
manages non-commercial distribution of electronic texts and
information about them on behalf of its depositors.

WHAT TEXTS DOES IT CONTAIN?

The Archive contains electronic versions of literary
works by many major authors in Greek, Latin, English and a
dozen or more other languages. It contains collections and
corpora of unpublished materials prepared by field workers in
linguistics. It contains electronic versions of some standard
reference works. It has copies of texts and corpora prepared
by individual scholars and major research projects worldwide.
The total size of the Archive exceeds a gigabyte and there
are about a thousand titles in its catalogue.

WHERE CAN I GET A CATALOGUE?

The Catalogue is available in paper form by post from the address
below. New editions are published at least twice a year. It is
also available in electronic form, either as a formatted file 
for display at a terminal or in a tagged form using SGML. These
files are available from a number of different places under
various names...

(1) on the Oxford VAX Cluster as
     OX$DOC:TEXTARCHIVE.LIST and OX$DOC:TEXTARCHIVE.SGML 

(2) from various ListServers, e.g.  LISTSERV@BROWNVM 
    (send the mail message GET HUMANIST FILELIST for details)

(3) by anonymous FTP from Internet site black.ox.ac.uk 
    (129.67.1.165) in the directory /ota 
    
Wherever you are, you can send a note to ARCHIVE@VAX.OXFORD.AC.UK 
specifying which form you want. 
 
WHAT ARE THE TEXTS LIKE?

Because the texts come from so many different sources,
they are held in many different formats.  The texts also vary
greatly in their accuracy and the features which have been
encoded. Some have been proof read to a high standard, while
others may have come straight from an optical scanner, Some
have been extensively tagged with special purpose analytic
codes, and others simply designed to mimic the appearance of
the printed source. The Archive does not require texts to 
conform to any standard of formatting or accuracy.

HOW USABLE ARE THE TEXTS?

Most of the texts can be used with commonly available
text indexing and concordancing software, or can easily be
converted for that purpose. All texts are held as `plain
ASCII' files on magnetic tape, with no special formatting
codes. Documentation of the coding scheme used in each text
is supplied with it, wherever possible.

WHAT ABOUT COPYRIGHT?

Many of the texts in the Archive are subject to some form
of copyright restriction. The Archive's obligations to its
depositors generally restrict use of the texts to private
study and research. In some cases, depositors have also
authorised use of the texts in teaching.  In all cases, users
of the texts must agree not to use the texts commercially and
not to redistribute copies of them without consultation.

HOW DO I ACCESS THE TEXTS?

If you are a registered user of Oxford University Computing
Services (i.e. you have an account on OXFORD.VAX or black), just
send an e-mail message to the username ARCHIVE (on either 
machine) specifying which texts you want to use and for what
purpose.

If you are not a registered OUCS user, you can access only
texts in categories P, U and A as described further below. 

P category texts are in the public domain. No formality is
needed for these texts. They can be downloaded directly by
anonymous FTP, from black.ox.ac.uk or from other sites offering
this facility. At present, very few texts are in this category;
subject to agreement with our depositors we hope to increase the
number greatly in the future.

U and A texts are usually distributed on magnetic tape or
cartridge, though smaller texts can be sent on diskette. We will
also send copies to you via the network, if you send us the
required information (i.e. a secure account-name and password),
provided that this can be done with reasonable success. Where
copies are made on disk or tape, we make a small distribution
charge to cover media and postage which *must* be paid in
advance.

WHAT DO THE CODES IN THE CATALOGUE MEAN?

Each title in the list is preceded by a code made of of a
single letter indicating the availability of the text (U, A, P,
or X), in some cases followed by a star, a number identifying
the text and another single letter which gives some idea of
the size of the text.

Availability codes:   

   X	Available only to registered OUCS users. May not be copied 
   U	Freely available for scholarly use in private research.
   U*   Freely available for scholarly use in private research and also 
        for teaching purposes.
   A	Available for scholarly use, but only with written
        authorisation from the depositor.
   P    Public domain text. Available without formality to anyone.		

Size codes:    	A	Size less than 512 Kb
		B	Size between 512 Kb and 1 Mb
       		C	Size between 1 and 2 Mb
		D	Size between 2 and 5 Mb
		E	Size greater than 5 Mb

Depending on format, a standard 600 foot magnetic tape
will hold up to 50 texts of size category A. Most texts of
size code A will fit on a standard double density floppy
diskette; any text of size code A or B will fit on a standard
high density diskette.

WHAT DO I DO TO ORDER A COPY OF A TEXT?

Texts with availability code P may be downloaded directly,
either from our anonymous FTP server at black.ox.ac.uk
[129.67.1.165] or from other FTP servers on the InterNet. For
more information on using FTP, please contact your local
computing service.

For all other texts, you must complete and return the following
proforma. For texts with availability code U, the only
authorisation needed is your signature on the Order Form. For A
category texts, you must also provide written authorisation from
the depositor of the text; you should therefore ask us for
depositor details before ordering. All orders must be prepaid to
the account of Oxford University Computing Service, in sterling
or in US dollars. We cannot issue invoices, and any orders which
are not prepaid or not submitted on the standard order form will
be ignored.

		      European Corpus Initiative
				   
			Call For Contributions
				   
			     September, 1992

The European Corpus Initiative was founded to oversee the acquisition
and preparation of a large multi-lingual corpus to be made available
in digital form for scientific research at cost and without royalties.
We believe that widespread easy access to such material would be a
great stimulus to scientific research and technology development as
regards language and language technology.  We support existing and
projected national and international efforts to carefully design,
collect and publish large-scale multi-lingual written and spoken
corpora, but also believe it will be some time before the scientific
and material resources necessary to bring these projects to fruition
will be found.  In the interim, a small and rapid effort to collect and
distribute existing material can serve to show the way.  No amount of
abstract argument as to the value of corpus material is as powerful as
the experience of actually having access to some in one's laboratory.
We aim to make that experience possible very soon, at a very low cost.

The ECI is carrying out the first phase of this activity on a purely
voluntary basis, under the guidance of an ad-hoc steering committee,
using facilities donated by the Human Communication Research Centre at
the University of Edinburgh and a small sum for expenses and
production costs provided by the European Network for Language and
Speech under its Linguistic Resources programme together with the
Network of European Reference Corpora.

Our present goal is to produce in short order (we're currently aiming
for November 1992) a multi-lingual corpus covering as many as possible
of the major European languages, in a consistent format, with
standardised (TEI-conformant) markup, insofar as resources allow.  Our
primary focus in this first effort is on textual material of all
kinds, including transcriptions of spoken material, but if space and
resources permit we may be able to include some sampled speech data as
well.  If in doubt as to the appropriateness of a contribution, please
contact us before assuming we won't want it.

As our main method of distribution for this corpus, we will produce a
CD-ROM, possibly two if enough material can be collected and prepared
in time.  We estimate that we should be able to make the results
available for around 25 ECU.

Because of the low level of resource available for this effort, we are
entirely dependent on the goodwill of those members of the research
community who have appropriate corpus material, to make it available
to us for wide distribution.  PLEASE SEND US YOUR DATA.  We have
promises of material for many, but by no means all, of the languages
we would like to cover, and in only one or two cases do we have as
much as we would like.  We can't guarantee to use everything which is
offered, but please, let us judge whether it would be useful.  If you
know of someone with material which might be appropriate, who may not
have received this notice, please pass it on to them.

To contribute data, please send electronic or paper mail to one of the
addresses given below, describing the data, its current format and the
medium it is stored in, and the restrictions on its use, if any, which
you would have to impose in making it available to us.

==================


	Does anyone have an Old English corpus (preferably glossed)
in machine readable format (preferably ascii) ?  Even something as small
as 10 or 20 Kb would be nice.  The goal is merely for an exercise in
taxonomy  for a beginning Historical Linguistics class.  

	I could also contribute a pair of transcripts of parallel 
role-plays by 2 groups of 4 speakers: the first by American education majors,
the second in English but by native speakers of Mandarin.  Both groups
were given the same roles and background info.  More details on request.

Thanks.

                          JUNE 16-19, 1993
               GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, D.C.
 
 
                          CALL FOR PAPERS
 
This conference is the major forum for literary, linguistic and
humanities computing.  It is concerned with the development of new
computing methodologies for research and teaching in the
humanities, the development of significant new networked-based and
computer-based resources for humanities research, and the
application and evaluation of computing techniques in humanities
subjects.
 
TOPICS: We welcome submissions on topics such as text encoding;
statistical methods for text analysis; hypertext; text corpora;
computational lexicography; morphological, syntactic, semantic and
other forms of text analysis; also, computer applications in history,
philosophy, music and other humanities disciplines. For the 1993
conference, ACH and ALLC extend a special invitation to members of the
library community to contribute to the conference on the topics of
creating and cataloguing network-based resources in the humanities,
developing and integrating databases of texts and images of works
central to the humanities, and refining retrieval techniques for
humanities databases.
 
LOCATION: Georgetown, an historic residential district along the Potomac 
River, is a six-mile ride by taxi from Washington National Airport. 
International flights arrive at Dulles Airport, which offers regular 
bus service to the Nation's Capital.
 
REQUIREMENTS: Proposals should describe substantial and original
work. Proposals describing the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how these methodologies are applied
to research and/or teaching in the humanities. Those concerned with a
particular application (e.g., a study of the style of an author)
should cite previous approaches to the problem and should include some
critical assessment of the computing methodologies used. All proposals
should include references to important sources.
 
ABSTRACT LENGTH: Abstracts of 1500-2000 words in length should be
submitted for presentations of thirty minutes including questions.
 
SESSION PROPOSALS: Proposals for sessions (90 minutes) are also
invited. These should take the form of either:
 
(a) Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word
statement describing the session topic, include abstracts of
1000-1500 words for each paper, and indicate that each author is
willing to participate in the session.
 
(b) A panel of up to 6 speakers.  The panel organizer should submit
an abstract of 1500-2000 words describing the panel topic, how it will
be organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that
each speaker is willing to participate in the session.

this was sent out. I apologise to those who got this message before.

-Knut Hofland

==================

WORKSHOP ON VERY LARGE CORPORA:
ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRIAL PERSPECTIVES

Call for Papers

WHEN: Tuesday, June 22, 1993 (just before ACL-93)
WHERE: Ohio State University

Sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Chemical
Abstracts, Mead Data Central (MDC), Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)

Corpus linguistics is a hot topic, and for good reason.  Text is more
available than ever before.  And, consequently, it is easier to use
corpus data more effectively than it was in the 1950s, the last time
that empiricism was in fashion.  All of this data provides a great
opportunity, as evidenced by all of the recent activity in Europe,
Asia and America.

How large is ``large''?  Large can mean anything from about 10^4 words
to 10^9 words.  This workshop will bring together a range of people
working at a range of different points along this scale.  We expect to
hear from industrialists who routinely deliver products based on tens
of billions of words of text, and from academics who will tell us
about recent advances in text analysis.  The discussion will hopefully
push the academics to think about even larger corpora, and the
industrialists to think about somewhat more ambitious analysis
techniques.

Authors should submit three copies of a full-length paper (5-10 pages)
to the program chair by April 1, 1993.  Paper submissions are strongly
preferred over electronic submissions.  Notifications of acceptance or
rejection will be sent out by May 1, 1993.  Relevant topics include
(but are not limited to)

    Text Analysis Techiques:
            - ``robust'' parsing
            - part of speech tagging
            - sense tagging
            - identification of phrases
            - collocation
            - morphology
            - discourse structure

    Applications:
            - Information Retrieval (IR)
            - Recognition: Speech, OCR, handwriting, etc.
            - Spelling Correction

The Dictionary of Old English in Toronto has a relatively complete
OE corpus available (excluding duplicate mss.), which is now
available through the Oxford Text Archive -- there is one text which
requires special permission, but the others are available.  They are
not glossed, and occupy about 30MB depending on your markup scheme.

RFC-822-HEADERS:
Summary: Looking for info
Keywords: character-set, charset, font


To All,

I.  I'm looking for pointers to documents describing the encodings used 
by several different character sets. In particular, I'm looking for the
encodings for:

1. EBCDIC
2. ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
3. ISO Latin-2 (ISO 8859-2)
4. Unicode [more than just the ascii part]
5. ISO 10646

If you know of any electronic document[s] describing any of the above, 
especially one that's ftpable, I'd really appreciate hearing from you.

II. Are the following statements correct? If not, how far off the mark are they?

1. A grapheme is logical unit of meaning used in the written representation
   of a language.

2. A glyph is a pictorial representation of a grapheme.

3. A font is an ordered set of glyphs.
   (i.e. a mapping between numeric (integer) values and glyphs.)

4. A character set is an ordered set of graphemes.
   (i.e. a mapping between numeric (integer) values and graphemes.)

5. A font encoding is a mapping between a character set and a font.

III. I'm looking for pointers to documentation on standard and ad-hoc mappings
between 7-bit ascii and 8-bit charsets. For example, on the mailing list
GAELIC-L, the accented vowels: a_acute, e_acute, i_acute, o_acute, u_acute,
a_grave, e_grave, i_grave, o_grave, u_grave; are represented as vowel + /
and vowel + \, respectively. What other encodings are in use? Where might I
get documentation (formal or informal) on them? Are there ISO standards
in existence or under development?

Thanx very much for your help! :-)

While I know this is somewhat distant from the interests of most
readers of this list, I wonder if anyone knows a source of electronic
American english corpora of fixed reading difficulty. Reading
difficulty should be measured by any standard test and should be
around secondary school levels. I need this for reading rate studies
in which I would like to control for the difficulty of the text.
I need at least 50,000 words, and probably much more. It should be
sparse in proper names (which tends to eliminate news articles,
the most obvious source).

ISO standard documents may purchased in the US from Omnicom, (703) 281-1135.
Unicode, and by extension ISO10646, is available in two volumes at your
local computer bookstore (published by Addison-Wesley).  As for EBCDIC,
see "EBCDIC Bibliographic Character Sets - Sources and Uses: A Brief Report,"
Journal of Library Automation, Vol. 12/4, December 1979.  This report
documents the extended EBCDIC used by many bibliographic services.  Also
see IBM Publication 1403-03, Order #GA 24-3073-7, p. 36-37.

>  1. A grapheme is logical unit of meaning used in the written representation
>     of a language.

In my recent text, "Introduction to Unicode," Proceedings of the Third
Unicode Implementor's Workshop, Ausust 1992, I defined it as follows:

  "A minimally distinctive unit of writing in the context of a particular
  writing system."

>  2. A glyph is a pictorial representation of a grapheme.

I had:

  "An abstract form which represents one or more glyph images, and which is
   used to visually depict encoded character data."

A "glyph image" is then:

  "The actual, concrete image of a glyph representation having been
   rasterized or otherwise imaged onto some display surface."

There is some distinction between "glyph" as "allograph" and "glyph image"
as a particular visual instance of a glyph, since one may take the same
allograph and display it under different transformations, linear and
non-linear.

>  3. A font is an ordered set of glyphs.
>     (i.e. a mapping between numeric (integer) values and glyphs.)

OK.  I had:

  "A collection of glyphs used for the visual depiction of character data.
   A font is often associated with a set of parameters, e.g., size, posture,
   weight, serifness, etc., which, when set to particular values, generate
   a collection of imagable glyphs."

>  4. A character set is an ordered set of graphemes.
>     (i.e. a mapping between numeric (integer) values and graphemes.)

Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work this way.  The reason being that
what constitutes a grapheme can only be determined in the context of
a particular writing system, i.e., a particular language, a particular
set of orthographic rules, and one or more collections of symbols (scripts)
used to depict writing.

Because character sets (generally) exclude language and orthographic
differences, the characters therein end up encoding the elements of
scripts independently of their status as graphemes.  Also, because
character sets in the past have often been confused with the enumeration
of the elements of a font, allographic symbols and arbitrary glyphic
elements have been encoded along with the more independent graphemic
symbols.

The best working definition for a character set is simply as "a collection
of elements used to organize, control, or represent information."  A character
is then simply "an element of a character set," i.e., an element which
"organizes, controls, or represents information."  Trying to read anything
else into "character," at least as currently implement by existing character
set standards, will soon lead you to great conceptual difficulties.

However, to go out on a conceptual limb, I would suggest that under ideal
circumstances a character represents "an abstract form which may solely
or jointly be used to represent the symbol of a script, which, in turn, may
represent one or more graphemes in the context of implicit or explicit
assumptions about the language and orthographic rules which apply to the
character encoding."  For example, the ASCII character 0x41 represents
the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A symbol, which, in an American English text,
represents the graphemes <a> and <majuscule>.  How's that for clarity?

>  5. A font encoding is a mapping between a character set and a font.

No.  A font encoding is a mapping from glyph codes, to the glyphs of a font.
The mapping between character set(s) and font(s), is, in general, much more
complex.  I offer the following excerpt from a message I sent recently
on the newsgroup "comp.fonts."

  In general, this model will not work for universal character sets which
  cover large numbers of writing systems, e.g., Unicode.  It must be replaced
  by a more sophisticated model:

    string of unicode characters ->
    rendering & layout engine    ->
    positioned glyphs

  In general, the rendering and layout engine must be able to do the following:

    - map 1 character to N (possibly discontiguous) glyphs*
    - map 1 character to 1 of N glyphs depending on context
    - map N characters to 1 glyph*
    - map M characters to N (possibly discontiguous) glyphs*
    - reorder resulting glyphs according to bidirectional display requirements
    - compute attachment points for glyphs which attach to other glyphs
    - deform glyphs for performing justifiction which doesn't use whitespace
      justification

    *may also require context sensitivity

The Unicode standard contains a large number of mapping tables to/from other
character sets and Unicode, e.g., all of the ISO8859 series, PC code pages,
Apple character sets, etc.

there is no single ebcdic standard.  one of the better ways to get an
ebcdic table is to run dd on a unix machine and have it convert a file
with all the consecutive byte values in various ways.

the best source on the unicode and 8859 character sets is the unicode
book from addison weseley.  it is supposed to have a companion disk,
but a-w is apparently committed to forgeting that they sell this.

i don't think that your definitions take script fonts like arabic and
compositional fonts like korean.  for that matter, many languages are
essentially compositional in at least some respect (how else to you
describe strike-outs, or underlines, much less the fact that you can
accent or otherwise add any diacritic to any european character).

with regard to ad-hoc mappings, they are just that.  ad-hoc.
incompatible.  many of the asian character sets use a shift character
after which it is assumed that the high bit is set, and many other
systems are based (loosely) on tex.  mac users often (accidentally,
they claim) use R and S for opening and closing single quotes.

I don't know of any, but I'd welcome the info on ANY American English
corpora anybody knows of.  I am trying to build a large collection for
research purposes, and a number of other people in TESOL would like to
do this, also.

The TESOL CALL Interest Section has a text collection in both MS-DOS and
Mac formats, available from DHEALEY@OREGON.BITNET, but these are not
"graded".

The ascii texts in programs such as "Text Tanglers" could be used for any
in-house purposes, and I'm sure such authors would be glad to give
permission for not quite in-house use if asked.  Although such texts are
also not "graded" in this way (whatever such grading means in native speaker
workdoes not transfer to ESL/EFL), they should be easily gradable by
running them through your favorite document analyzer.

You might try using the SRA Reading Laboratory materials.  These are
graded according to the Fry scale (I believe) in half grade intervals
of reading difficulty.  There is some question in my mind as to the
validity of the Fry scale since it doesn't take many factors into
account which can cause text to be less readable -- such as topic,
cultural background of the reader and even such mundane things as
type size and word density on the page.

There are 15 passages at each level, and there are several kits
containing passages at the same level, so you could probably get
50,000 words or so at each level using these materials.

Another approach would be for you to take anything you can get
your hands on which you think might be appropriate, and then rate
the reading level yourself.  There are any number of programs which
can do this.  Even my word processor, Nisus (Macintosh) has this
feature.

	Georgetown University Round Table On Languages and Linguistics (GURT)
			Pre-Session: CORPUS-BASED LINGUISTICS

			     Wednesday March 10, 1993

The analysis of large text corpora is engaging the interest of linguists from
many subfields, as the field turns away from linguistic analysis based on
introspection to data-oriented approaches. Currently, insights are not fully
shared, as the subfields and related disciplines often present research at
different conferences. For this full-day GURT pre-session, 20-minute 
papers are solicited on the following topics:

	- the design and collection of text/speech corpora
	- tools for searching and processing on-line corpora
	- critical assessments of on-line corpora and corpus-processing tools
	- methodological issues in corpus-based analysis
	- applications and results in linguistics and related 
	disciplines, including language teaching, computational linguistics, 
	historical linguistics, discourse analysis, and stylistic analysis

Send 1 page (500-word) abstracts to cball@guvax.georgetown.edu (Internet), 
cball@guvax (Bitnet), or Catherine N. Ball, Dept. of Linguistics, 
Georgetown University, Washington DC 20057. Electronic submissions are 
encouraged. Please include name, institution, address, telephone number, and 
e-mail address.

You hunt up a K-12 sales rep.  It's commercial stuff, widely used in
elem/sec schools and some of it in ESL programs.  Call your local school

For what it's worth, SRA Reading Laboratory was the system used in my
elementary school in the 60s.  It's a self-paced system of a large number
of graded readings.  I loved it.

I'm talking about electronic form. I'd like to avoid scanning half a
million words and proofreading it all for OCR errors. All the school
people do is respond "Umm, computers? Why don't you call an IBM sales
office?".

But I confess, I didn't try calling the publishers of the written
material to ask whether they can supply electronically. I'll do that, but
I'm not optimistic about the results. Most publishers live in the stone
age (or really, the phototype age) about computer technology and can't
even _accept_ stuff in electronic form, let alone produce it.

I, too, like some SRA materials.  The ones I have used and like are
boxes of cards dealing with different "thinking" skills and at several
levels of difficulty within a box (set).  My students have really
enjoyed (and talked up a storm in English) with these, especially
the kinds of problems where you have to figure out who sits where at
the table or ho is the spy, etc. from a set of statments about the
people in the problem.  John Higgins has done two computer programs
for CALL with this kind of idea, one dealing with comparative structures
and set in Venn diagrams, one a simple physical layout with collections
of words from the same semantic domain to be placed in the proper places.
The value of these in ELT is similar to that of the SRA cards, HOTS and
communication.  Plus the fact that they are fun, thus motivational.

To All:

 A week ago I posted an article asking for information on the
 definition of several character code sets, including ISO 10646/Unicode.
 Also I asked for a review of the definitions I gave for the terms "grapheme",
 "glyph", "font", "character set" and "font encoding". And thirdly, I asked
 for information pertaining to various encodings of non-ascii character
 sets into ascii. 

 I received many, many very detailed and thoughtful replies to my posting
 and I'd like to thank all those who repsonded, in particular:

In the sections below, I've tried to summarize my requests and the responses
I received. In general, I tried to paraphrase, merge and otherwise 
condense the replies without distorting the meaning. In many cases, however, 
I didn't think I would do justice to the original and so I have included 
whole sections of text from various replies, with (I hope) appropriate 
accreditation. I apologize in advance for the length and for any typos
or omissions I may have made.

Some of what follows will be familiar to those of you who have read the
follow-up articles, especially on comp.fonts. However, in fairness to those
in other news groups or on various mailing lists, I have included information
from both public responses and those e-mailed directly to me.

Due to the number and length of responses, I have split this summary into
tow pieces. Parts I covers questions 1) and 2) in my original posting.
Part II includes repsonses to question 3).

   The files there are locally produced I believe, not authorized by ISO
   or Unicode, so I'm not sure what the restrictions on their use might
   be. At a glance the 8859-1 character set seems to be complete, but the
   10646 file only contains a subset of the 10646/Unicode characters.

B. CCITT
   
   Among the relevant CCITT standards are:
   
   T.50 - International Alphabet No. 5
   
      This is the same as ISO 646, the 7-bit invariant character set.
      
   T.51 - Coded Character Sets for Telematic Services
   
      This describes the use of the ISO 2022 escape sequence mechanism
      for specifying a desired code set in terms of control groups C0 and 
      C1 and graphic groups G0, G1, G2, and G3. It also contains several 
      tables in Annex A, sec. A.2 through A.5 which define a set of identifiers
      for the Latin (extended) character set, digits, and various symbols.
      Annex B contains a table cross-referencing the various T-series
      recommendations defining alternative C0, C1, G0, G1, G2, G3 groups.
      
      [The tables are quite usable. The description of ISO 2022 is
        impenetrable.]
      
   T.61 - Character Repertoire and Coded Character Sets for the
      International Teletex Service
      
      This recommendation is specifically applicable to teletex.
      It contains material from T.50, T.51, ISO 646, ISO 2022, ISO 6429 
      and ISO 6937, as well as new material and emmendations. It also, 
      includes a set of identifiers for the extended Latin character set
      (which appears to be the same as in T.51.)
      
   X.408 - Message Handling Systems: Encoded Information Type
      Conversion Rules
      
      "This Recommendation specifies the algorithms the MHS [Message
      Handling System] uses when converting between different types of
      encoded information.
      
      This recommendation offers conversion rules and tables for converting
      among Telex (F.1), IA5 (T.50), Teletex (T.60, T.61 and F.200), Group3 
      fax, Group4 class1 fax, Videotex, and mixed mode.

   I totally munged it, sorry. I understand now that it is dangerous even
   to speak of a grapheme except in the context of a particular language
   and writing system.

   I should not have tried to link glyphs and graphemes, it appears that
   there's no direct connection, in general.

   I goofed. I believe what I was trying to describe was not a font encoding,
   but (at least a part of) a rendering. 

Reference definitions:

   CCITT Recommendation T.51:

character - A member of a set of elements used for the organization, control
   or representation of data.
   
coded character set; code - A set of unambiguous rules that establishes a 
   character set and the one-to-one relationship between the characters of
   the set and their bit combinations.

   The Unicode Standard 1.0, Volume 1:
   
character - (1) The smallest component of written language that has semantic
   value. Character refers to the abstract idea, rather than a specific 
   shape (see also glyph), though in code tables some form of visual
   representation is essential for the reader's understanding. (2) The basic
   unit of encoding for the Unicode character encoding, 16 bits of information.
   (3) Synonym for "code element." (4) The English name for the ideographic
   written elements of Chinese origin.
   
character encoding - association of a unique number with each character in
   a set of characters. The distinction between characters and glyphs is
   not absolutely clear in all cases, and so most large character
   encodings also encode some set of glyphs.
   
code set - A character encoding; this term is widely used by programmers.
  
glyph - (1) The actual shape (bit pattern, outline) of a character image.
   For example, an italic "a" and a roman "a" are two different glyphs
   representing the same underlying character. In this strict sense, any
   two images which differ in shape constitute different glyphs. In this
   usage, "glyph" is a synonym for "character image" or simply "image."
   (2) A kind of idealized surface form derived from some combination of
   underlying characters in some specific context, rather than an actual
   character image. In this broad usage, two images would constitute the
   same glyph whenever they have essentially the same topology (as in
   oblique "a" and roman "a"), but different glyphs when one is written
   with a hooked top and the other without (as in italic "a" and roman
   "a"). In this usage, "glyph" is a synonym for "glyph type," where
   glyph is defined as in sense 1.

Other codes in the text correspond to various editorial markings which are
difficult to translate into ASCII.  A little experimentation will render them
useful.  A few characters need no transliteration.

The following characters and editorial markings do not appear to be in the
documents in the collection, either by coincidence or because they were
filtered out during transmission and/or reformatting, but are included
in the AIAS coding scheme:

        dash -                          -

Appendix 4: CHART OF CODINGS FOR TRANSLITERATION OF HEBREW-ARABIC

There is as yet no substantial agreement as to what codes to use for the
transliteration of Hebrew and Arabic.  This collection uses the Michigan-
Claremont scheme for Hebrew texts, and the Oxford schemes for Arabic.
The following chart records various codings, along with some suggestions
towards standardization of Semitic language coding:

Dear CORPORA subscriber,

As you know, one important aim of ICAME is to provide information
about studies based on or related to the English text corpora
distributed through ICAME. For this purpose, a regularly updated
bibliography is available on the ICAME fileserver: FILESERV@HD.UIB.NO.
To obtain the bibliography, send a message to this address giving the
following lines in the body of the message:

send icame bibliography.1991
send icame bibliography.1992

To make the bibliography as useful and up-to-date as possible we need
your help. Could you please check the latest version of the bibliography
and send any corrections and/or additions to the compiler Bengt Altenberg
(not to Bergen!), by e-mail or ordinary mail, under the following
address:

   Department of English
   Helgonabacken 14
   S-223 62 Lund, Sweden

   E-mail: Alten@seldc52.bitnet

Please note the following:

o   Send information about published or readily accessible works only
    (leave forthcoming titles till they have appeared in print);

o   Give full bibliographical information: name of author(s), year of
    publication, title of work, and (where relevant) name of
    periodical/collection, editor(s), page references, place of
    publication and publisher;

o   As far as possible, use the stylistic conventions of the ICAME
    bibliography (or the LSA style sheet);

o   For each title, indicate which corpus or corpora the study is
    based on or related to.

Thank you,

Bengt Altenberg

   We have heard of some text corpuses but we don't know how to access
   any of them. Does anyone out there have an address, phone number or
   e-mail address for any of these: TIPSTER -supposedly contains 
   a dbase of 10^6 documents, the CACM collection, the NPL collection

TIPSTER corpus and the TREC corpus are one and the same, a large text
collection put together under the auspices of DARPA (US Defense
Advanced Research Program) for the purpose of evaluating information
retrieval systems.  (TIPSTER is a DARPA project on information
retrieval.  TREC stands for Text Retrieval Evaluation Corpus.)  It is
not yet publicly available, but will eventually be distributed by NIST
(The US Bureau of Standards) on CDROM's.  The texts in the
TIPSTER/TREC corpus have been extracted from the ACL/DCI text
collection.  There are roughly one million documents in the
collection, occupying over 1.5 Gigabytes in ascii form.  Along with
documents there are 50 queries each paired with a set of documents
judged relevant.

The CACM collection is a classic information retrieval reference
collection.  Like TREC it pairs queries with sets of documents judged
relevant.  Unlike TREC it is very small (approximately 1.5 Megabytes)
with many documents only having titles and the rest titles and
abstracts.  The CACM corpus, along with other IR reference collections
is available on CDROM from Edward Fox (fox@fox.cs.vt.edu).

Subject: TREC


TREC (text retrieval evaluation CONFERENCE)

   (The US Bureau of Standards) on CDROM's.  The texts in the
   TIPSTER/TREC corpus have been extracted from the ACL/DCI text
   collection.

there are a large number of texts that were not part of the ACL/DCI
stuff.

   There are roughly one million documents in the collection,
   occupying over 1.5 Gigabytes in ascii form.

in fact, each disk contains about 1.2 GB of text after you account for
compression.

   Along with documents there are 50 queries each paired with a set of
   documents judged relevant.

and a list of the documents that were examined and found irrelevant.

The British National Corpus is to be a balanced, TEI-comformant,
part-of-speech tagged, corpus of 100 million WORDS of modern spoken and
written British English (making it, according to my guess, about 2
gigabytes uncompressed), but will not be available until April, 1994.

You can get information about both the TIPSTER corpora and the TREC
collection (perhaps also CACM) from :

   any of these: TIPSTER -supposedly contains a dbase of 10^6

   12000 old documents, the TREC collection, the British National
   Corpus -supposedly 100Mb, or the Tresor de la Langue Francaise?


just a note...

the TIPSTER english and TREC corpora are identical.  i believe that
the tipster corpus is still not publically available.

the easiest large corpus to get right now is the acl/dci text corpus
which comes on cdrom.  contact the dci for this.

Some of the corpora mentioned by Gillian Smith are standard test collections
used in Information Retrieval (IR).  These are the CACM collection and the
NPL collections.  Both of them (as well as a number of other test collections)
are available from Ed Fox (fox@fox.cs.vt.edu).  The Tipster corpus is available
from Donna Harman (harman@magi.ncsl.nist.gov).  It is part of an effort to
test information retrieval systems using a truly large corpus (multiple
gigabytes).  The TREC corpus is the same as the Tipster corpus.  TREC is
an open competition to test IR systems, and Tipster is a government-sponsored
research effort.  Please contact Donna Harman for more information about TREC.

My current CACM (35.10, Oct 1992) says (ad on p. 116) that all ACM
computer science literature is available -- on an article-by-article
basis, apparently -- from Engineering Information Inc. Document
Delivery Service.  Phone Ruth Miller at Engineering Information, Inc.,
+1 (800) 221-1044, +1 (201) 216-8537, fax +1 (201) 216-8526.  I doubt
that this is what you want, or are talking about.  I have vague
memories of seeing ads in CACM for a CD-ROM of computer science
material, but I can't find them in any copies of CACM on my shelf,
and no CD that I can recognize is listed among the ACM publications
in the front matter of the journal.  Perhaps it's described in SIGIR
documents somewhere?

   ... kyoto's tagger juman is 93% accurate ...



the first version of juman was pretty slow and not terribly accurate
due to its small lexicon.



the new version is rumored to remedy both defects.

   But I confess, I didn't try calling the publishers of the written
   material to ask whether they can supply electronically. I'll do that, but
   I'm not optimistic about the results. Most publishers live in the stone
   age (or really, the phototype age) about computer technology and can't
   even _accept_ stuff in electronic form, let alone produce it.

You might try to negotiate with them about getting hold of the
typesetting tapes.  Even though this may not be a regular product, it
is sometimes possible to get hold of a copy of the typesetting tape.
I've never negotiated directly with a publisher to get hold of such a
tape, but those who have indicate that the responses range from ``If
you'll actually take care of the original tapes for us, we'll give
them to you'' to demands for scads and scads of money.  The problem is
(1) publishers' main business currently is text publishing, so they
are leery about giving away their product (fear of piracy or use by
competitors); and (2) since there is no general market for
``electronic books'' etc., there are no market forces to set a price,
so they do not have any idea of what an electronic version of their
product is worth, and so may wildly over- or under- estimate the
value.

If you are willing to accept electronic versions of texts that are no
longer produced, this may help out.  Publishers are sometimes more
willing to distribute E-versions of texts that they no longer have any
market interest in, and, hence, have little or nothing to lose if they
are pirated.  You will almost certainly have to sign a licensing
agreement if you pry something loose, agreeing not to re-distribute
the texts, use them in commercial products, etc.

Good luck.

   The concordancer Letteratura Amica (or Literary Amiga in English) 
   developed by Raffaele Cocchi of the U of Bologna tags and works in
   most European languages.  He's still working on improving the allophones
   and algorithms for the speech function (this talks in its 9 [?] languages,
   too), but the concordancer part is well developed.

Some questions:

(1) Does this work for all the EC languages?
(2) What sorts of tags does it have for nouns and verbs?  e.g. for a
language with rich morphological Case, such as German or Modern Greek,
one might expect the noun tags to include the Case information,
whereas for English and Dutch, say, where only pronouns bear overt
Case, the noun tags probably wouldn't.  Similarly for verbs and
aspect, mood, and voice.
(3) How large are the lexicons for each language for the tagger
functions?
(4) How does the tagger deal with unknown words?  Is it stochastic?
Rule-based?  Stochastic with knowledge-based overlay?

   His address:  Via Toffano, 6; 40125 Bologna, Italy

Does he have an EMail address?
