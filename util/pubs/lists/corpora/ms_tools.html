TOOLS

Based on the data described above, we constructed a set of tools that all
aim at the enrichment of the lexical data, both the amount of lexical
entries and the richness and thje accuracy of their description

Tools are described useing the following data structure:

<name>  name of the program
<lang> programming language(s) used
<dev> developer(s)
<desc> a short description of the program
<av> availability

a. text handling

First of all a full text data base, developed by a student of computer
science, serves the tasks of administering texts and generating
intermediate results. This tool as all the others follow the UNIX
philosphy of modularizationan and combinablity. Standard interface is the
UNIX command shell. So the tools in any combination needed could be
embedded into an X-Window or Motif interface.
Programs written in C respect the ANSI-C standard. They do not use special
libraries.

<name> freq 
<lang> C
<dev> Humanist package developers 
<desc> generation of word type frequency lists from corpus texts.
<av> yes 

<name> kwic 
<lang> C, reimplementation in C++ 
<dev> Johannes Prinz 
<desc> a grep-like program, tailored for the needs of the lexicographer.
The program identifies strings according to a regular expression (or a
combination of them) in a corpus and extracts this strings in a contexts
of a size definable by the user. Dump in files or pretty printing
possible. 
<av> yes 


<name> tag 
<lang> C, SQL 
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer
<desc> Tagging of all word forms found in a concardance by simple
dictionary look up. Lemma and part of speech are added to each word form.
The program keeps track of word forms not yet found in the dictionary data
base. 
<av> no

<name> stat 
<lang> C, SQL
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer
<desc> Based ot the output of tag, statistical figures about cooccurence
probabilities of the key word with any other word are computed. Methods
used up to now are mutual information index and t-score test.
<av> no

b. conversion tools

<name> FAZ2DTD 
<lang> C, LEX
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer. Peter Lisowski
<desc> Conversion of FAZ printing tapes to articles structured according
to Document Type Definition (DTD) 
<av> yes

<name> ZEIT2DTD 
<lang> C, LEX
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer, Christian Mueller-Boehm 
<desc> Conversion of ZEIT printing tapes to articles structured according
to Document Type Definition (DTD) 
<av> yes

<name> VDI2DTD 
<lang> C, LEX
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer 
<desc> Conversion of vdi-nachrichten  printing tapes to articles structured 
according to Document Type Definition (DTD) 
<av> no 

<name> PAIS2DTD 
<lang> C, LEX
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer , Antonio Moreno
<desc> Conversion of EL PAIS  printing tapes to articles structured 
according to Document Type Definition (DTD) 
<av> yes

c. Lexion import tools

<name> DICTPARS 
<lang> C, LEX, YACC, SQL
<dev>  Lothar Lemnitzer , Dietmar Stosik 
<desc> Conversion of sample entries of a bilingual dictionary
(German-Spanish) with fully fledged informations structure into an
SGML-format. Extractiona of pieces of information from this structure to
store them into fields in a relational database
according to Document Type Definition (DTD)
<av> no
