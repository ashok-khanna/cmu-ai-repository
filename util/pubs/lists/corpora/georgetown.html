             CPET DIGESTS NOW AVAILABLE VIA GOPHER AND FTP


For the past four years, Georgetown University's Center for Text &
Technology (CTT), under the aegis of the Academic Computer Center,
has been compiling a directory of projects that create and analyze
electronic text in the humanities.  A relational database
accessible via the Internet, Georgetown's Catalogue of Projects in
Electronic Text (CPET) includes information on more than 350
projects throughout the world.

Now digests of project information -- organized by humanities
discipline and by language of the electronic text -- can be read,
searched, and retrieved by means of the Internet's protocols for
Gopher and anonymous FTP. There are digests for 40 different
languages, as well as for linguistics, literature, philosophy,
biblical studies, and a variety of others, ranging from Medieval
and Renaissance studies to Archaeology, African studies, and
Buddhism.


GOPHER - INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESS

The CPET digests are organized into subdirectories on Georgetown
University's Gopher server.  If you have never used Gopher, you may
wish to consult your local Internet expert to determine whether you
have access to Gopher client software or to obtain for instructions
for using it.  At many locations, one simply types the word GOPHER
at the system prompt of the networked mainframe.

Once inside the main Gopher directory, look for CPET files under:

      Other Gopher and Information Servers
      North America
      USA
      Washington, DC
      Georgetown University

Please note that the menu item for Washington, DC, appears
alphabetically after Washington state and not after Delaware.

On the Georgetown server look into the directory
CPET_PROJECTS_IN_ELECTRONIC_TEXT, where you will find the following
files and subdirectories:

      1. CPET_DIGESTS_INTRODUCTION.TXT  (information on the digests)
      2. CPET_INTRODUCTION.TXT (information on the CPET database)
      3. CPET_USER_GUIDE.TXT (how to access the on-line database)
      4. DIGESTS_DISCIPLINES.DIR (digests organized by discipline)
      5. DIGESTS_LANGUAGES.DIR (digests organized by language)

The filenames of the digests have as extensions the approximate
size in kilobytes of each file; filesize will determine the length
of time needed to acquire the file.

Before retrieving any of the digests, please read the introductory
file (CPET_DIGESTS_INTRODUCTION.TXT).


FTP - INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESS

The digests are arranged in a similar structure in Georgetown's FTP
server.  To survey the digests, first enter the following command
from your system prompt:

      ftp guvax.georgetown.edu  (or ftp 141.161.1.2)

When requested, login with the username ANONYMOUS and a password
according to the formula YOURNAME@YOURSITE.

Once within GUVAX, at the ftp prompt ( often either ftp> or * ),
change directories as follows:

      ftp> cd cpet_projects_in_electronic_text

Then if you then enter a directory command -- DIR -- you will find
the same files and subdirectories that are described in the
preceding section of these directions on gopher.

To inspect the other directories in a subdirectory, change
directories again.  Do not enter the .DIR extension or the version
number, and distinguish between hyphens and underscores when typing
the filenames.

For example, at the prompt enter a command such as the following:

      ftp>cd digests_disciplines

To explore further the directory structure and the file contents,
enter the commands to show the directory (DIR) or to change the
directory (CD) as often as necessary.

Note: some subdirectories contain more than one complete screen of
filenames, so when you enter a dir command, the initial contents of
the subdirectory may scroll off the screen.  To stop the scrolling,
use whatever device your system permits.  For example, with VAX VMS
one would use CTRL-S (that is, hold down the CTRL key and press the
S key) to stop scrolling and CTRL-Q to continue scrolling.

To retrieve a file, type at the ftp prompt the command GET followed
by the name of the file (with the filename extension) that you wish
to retrieve.  For example,

      ftp> get finnish.17K

A system message will confirm that the file has been transferred to
your computer (more specifically, to the directory from which you
invoked ftp).

To leave FTP, enter at the prompt the command BYE.

      ftp> bye
