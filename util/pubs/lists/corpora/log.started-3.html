Subject:    German Text

I am looking for machine readable german corpora to test the 
coverage of a german paring system. Information on any kind of 
on line German text would be greatly appreciated; I am especially 
interested in text which contains morphological and syntactic errors,
since my system incorporates an error diagnosis component. I heard 
something about a "Miami corpus" but have not been able to find any 
references on this.

Dear colleagues,
There is some material on language policies in Africa in my
"English in Africa.An Introduction" Longman Linguistics Library 1991;
it includes economic points in a flow diagram of decision making.
If you have specific questions, I can also establish contacts with African
colleagues.

As a result of the query about German texts, I got the snapshot list
of texts from Oxford. This list is 3555 lines, so I will not redistribute
it. But the list (and other information about the Oxford archive) is
available on our file servers in the directory INFO. I have split the
list file in subfiles for each language, see the enclosed extract of the

I would greatly appreciate if someone could send

Longmans have been making LDOCE (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English,
First Edition, 1978) available to academic researchers for quite a while now.
It is however definitely not public domain. The lexical information is a
valuable asset, and the terms on which it is made available are that it may
only be used for research.  The type of research under consideration must be
described as part of a contract permitting the researcher to use it, with
reports and papers based on it sent to Longman.

The book `Computational Lexicography and Natural Language Processing'
edited by Boguraev and Briscoe (Longman 1989) describes some of the work done
using LDOCE.

there is *NO* public domain version of any of longman's dictionaries
around.


in fact, if somebody is passing copies around without permission from
longman's then they are doing a massive disservice to the research
community because the dictionary publishers are enormously touchy
about the possibility that they will lose control of their materials.
having this come true in the slightest will cause an enormous twitch
that none of us would like to see.

if we all can avoid this sort of situation then i think that the
publishers will soon loosen up considerably.  but until then, please
be very careful.

The Dept. of Slavonic Languages at the University of Helsinki has

(see the description below). We are ready to e-mail it to any OCS
scholar interested in it. Four our record, please tell what use you

you report of any errors you notice in the text, and even more
grateful if you can send us e-texts in Slavonic, Baltic or classical
languages in exchange.

An e-text of the Codex Assemanianus is in preparation.

AN ELECTRONIC TEXT OF THE CODEX MARIANUS

The e-text version of the Codex Marianus consists of four files, one
for each Gospel. The file sizes under Unix are as follows:

                  105622 marmt.txt
                   76309 marmc.txt
                  131799 marlc.txt
                   92189 marjo.txt

The e-text should be considered as a tertiary source as it is not
based on the manuscript itself, but on Vatroslav Jagic's edition
thereof. The files are not meant to be completely self-explanatory:
they must be used with the edition.

The lines in the files do not correspond to the manuscript lines,
being arranged according to Gospel chapters and verses. Each line
begins with an seven-digit number which is to be interpreted as
follows:

 - first digit: Gospel (1=Matthew, 2=Mark, 3=Luke, 4=John)
 - the following two digits: Gospel chapter
 - the following two digits: verse
 - the last but one digit: line number inside the verse (in the file,
   not in the codex: 0,1,2,...)
 - the last digit: always 0 (reserved for special uses)

In the beginning of each Gospel (except for Matthew, the beginning of
which is missing in the codex) there is a "00-chapter, 00-verse"
section into which the pericope lists found in the codex are placed. In
these passages the line division does correspond to that of the codex.

The transliteration used in the text only makes use of the 7-bit ASCII
code so as to ensure maximal portability. Upper-case letters are used
to represent different graphemes than the corresponding lower-case
letters. A transliteration table will be mailed with the files.

Subject:    data format of annotated corpora

I'ld like to know if there are any strong feelings out there in
corpora-land concerning the format of annotated corpora.

We are about to prepare an annotated corpus of German and are facing
the quesiton whether to do the annotation in a SGML-based
TEI-conformant format or on the basis of a vertikalized text with one
wordform plus annotations per line.

Is TEI merely a format for information interchange or is it feasible
to do basic analysis (frequencies, concordances, distributional
analysis etc.) with this format? As we do not want to spend time for
developping yet another freq- and kwic-program, we'ld like to know if
there are any programs available to do this kind of analysis on the
basis of SGML-tagged texts? Are there tools which allow me to deal
with an SGML-tagged text as easily as I can manipulate a vertikalized
text with grep, awk, icon and similar tools?

Has anybody *worked* with annotated texts in TEI-format?

It is our understanding that the final product will be an
TEI-conformant SGML-tagged text. The question is whether this is the
right format to use during data preparation.

Subject:    Linguistic Research - Call For Partners

======================================================================
======================CALL FOR PARTNERS===============================
================LINGUISTIC RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING===================
======================================================================

The Institute for Language Tehnology and Artificial Intelligence (ITK),
Tilburg University, The Netherlands, intends to submit a proposal for
the Linguistic Research and Engineering programme of the European
Communities. 

We are looking for partners to form a consortium that will formulate
the definite proposal and carry out the research. Partners should
preferably satisfy the following profile:

* be located in United Kingdom, Denmark, or Germany; the
  consortium will consist of one participant per language domain
  (English, Dannish German, Dutch);

* have access to and experience with tools for natural language
  processing;

* have experience with automatic processing and annotation of natural
  language corpora.

The proposal to be submitted will be a internationalization of a Dutch
project that is currently being executed by ITK, the Dutch software
firm Syllogic, and the Dutch institute for development of
educational courses for all kinds of professions (SLO). The goal of this
small-scale project is to use NLP techniques to translate NL sentences
into data structures in order to support storage, retrieval and
comparison of professional skills and educational objectives. The
extension of this project to other language domains of the European
Communities will stimulate the development and use of standard
encodings for professional skills and educational objectives and will
make comparison possible between educational programmes of different
countries.

The following tasks will be part of the EC project:

* definition of an international standard encoding format (eg. TEI)
  for the specific corpora used in the educational field;

* automatic analysis and coding of large corpora of sentences.

These tasks will be carried out for each language domain by a research
institute in close collaboration with an institute for educational
programme development.

We are looking forward to hear from any institute that is willing to
cooperate in this kind of research embedded in an international project.
Institutes interested are kindly requested to react within a few days;
signs of interest will, of course, not be considered as binding.

Dear Colleague,

     We have recently become aware of the lack of communication
between researchers on Modern Greek and the need for exchange of
information, and so we are taking the initiative to distribute
this survey of machine-readable corpora of Modern Greek.
     Its aim is to collect information about the nature and
structure of collections of text in machine-readable form and the
specifications of hardware and software tools. This information
will be available to interested researchers and is intended to
provide a basis for discussion and exchange of information on the
future of Modern Greek corpora.
     By corpus, we mean broadly a text collection, comprising
texts to be studied individually, not linked in any coordinated
way, collected works of an author, texts selected to study a
particular author, textbanks, databases or bibliographies. If you
are not personally involved in the compilation of such a machine-
readable corpus, could you pass the survey to others or suggest
their names to us.
     We would hope to complete the results of the survey by March
1993; depending on the extent of the response we may come back
to you for more detail.

     We would like to thank you in advance for your help and we'd
be happy to hear any suggestions from you.

                 FIFTH MESSAGE UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM EVALUATION
                  AND MESSAGE UNDERSTANDING CONFERENCE (MUC-5)

                         1 MARCH - 27 AUGUST, 1993
                    Preparation: 1 March - 23 May
                                 29 May - 25 July
                    Evaluations: 24-28 May (dry run)
                                 26-30 July (formal run)
                     Conference:  25-27 August

                             Sponsored by:
                Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
           Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office
                             (DARPA/SISTO)

     The Message Understanding Conferences have provided on ongoing
forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis
technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational
techniques.  They have also encouraged experimentation in the context
of fully implemented systems that perform the realistic task of
extracting factual information from free text.  The first two
conferences focused on short naval messages; the two most recent
conferences challenged the systems with longer and stylistically
varied terrorism news stories.  The four conferences have seen the
application of a wide variety of approaches to the information
extraction task.  
     There is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of the
technologies.  At the same time, performance constraints attributed to
inadequate computational methods are becoming serious issues for the
more highly developed systems.  The Fifth Message Understanding
Conference (MUC-5) will continue the technology assessment cycle, with
new information extraction tasks in new domains.  MUC-5 will also
continue the effort to define an insightful, objective set of
performance evaluation criteria.
     DARPA sponsors the Message Understanding Conferences as part of
the TIPSTER Text program.  Participation in MUC-5 is actively sought
from both new and veteran organizations.  Veteran evaluation
participants will be able to measure their progress in designing
robust, end-to-end information extraction systems and to continue the
fruitful interchange of ideas about systems and evaluation.  New
participants will also contribute to and benefit from such
interactions, while learning to manage the challenges posed by the
evaluation task.  In this process, all organizations enjoy some
advantages and suffer from some disadvantages in the evaluation.
These differing circumstances are recognized by the evaluators and
should not deter organizations from participating.
     The conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and
discussions of test results, system design, and innovative techniques.
Attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and
to guests invited by DARPA.  A conference proceedings, including all
test results, will be published.
     Modest amounts of financial support will be made available to
selected participants in an effort to maximize the number of
participants and to attract the widest possible variety of technical
approaches and system architectures.  This funding is intended only as
a supplement to other support.  Both U.S. and non-U.S.  participants
are eligible for this funding.

SCHEDULE:
     3 January 1993    Deadline for applications that include funding 
                       requests
     15 January 1993   Final application deadline (no funding requests)
     1 February 1993   Notification of acceptance and funding
     1 March 1993      Release of system development corpus and 
                       evaluation software
     24-28 May 1993    Performance evaluation (dry run) on test corpus
     26-30 July 1993   Performance evaluation (formal run) on new test
                       corpus
     25-27 August 1993 Fifth Message Understanding Conference

DATA AND TASK DESCRIPTION:
     Subject to successful completion of negotiations to obtain proper
permissions concerning the data, the data and task to be used for
MUC-5 will be the same as those already in use for the data extraction
portion of the DARPA/SISTO TIPSTER Text program.  There are two
languages, English and Japanese, and two domains, joint ventures and
microelectronic chip fabrication.  These form four separate corpora.
The texts are newswire articles selected to produce the desired mix of
relevant and nonrelevant texts, and they were blindly divided into
pools of development (training) and test data.
     The task is to extract information about the nature and status of
activities in the domain, the entities involved, etc.  Analysts have
been doing software-assisted manual generation of the "key" templates
against which the system-generated templates will be evaluated.  The
template design is object oriented, and each slot in the template has
its own fill specifications for data type, valency, etc.  The fill
specifications in each domain vary slightly between English and
Japanese, reflecting differences in language usage; however, the
general design of the template is the same for both languages.
     An English and a Japanese sample text and corresponding template
in the joint ventures domain are available from the program chair
(address at end of this announcement).  Please specify which
language(s) you are interested in.  A microelectronics example may be
available shortly.  The total amount of data that will be available in
March to support system development is expected to be between 200 and
1,000 templates and corresponding texts.  This number will vary
according to the corpus and the data rights that are obtained.  To
receive the data, participants will be required to acknowledge its
copyright status by signing agreements to safeguard the data and to
use it for research purposes only.

TEST PROTOCOL AND EVALUATION CRITERIA:
     MUC-5 participants may elect to do either language or both
languages; they are limited to selecting just one domain.
Participants will have access to TIPSTER Government-Furnished
Information and shared resources such as the training texts and
templates, task documentation, gazetteers, and evaluation software.
TIPSTER data extraction contractors will be participating in MUC-5,
for which previously unseen test data will be used.
     Each test set will consist of 100-300 texts, depending on
language and domain.  A dry-run test will be conducted about three
months after the release of the training data; the formal test will be
conducted about two and one-half months after the dry run.  Each test
will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in
accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to
NRaD for official scoring by domain analysts.
     Systems will be evaluated using the criteria applied to the
TIPSTER Text data extraction systems.  These criteria, which are still
under development, are likely to use the scoring categories (correct,
partially correct, incorrect, spurious, missing, and noncommittal) to
support not only the measures used for MUC-4 (recall, precision,
overgeneration, fallout, and F-measure) but also new measures
(probability of detection, probability of false alarm, and a measure
that combines them).  MUC-5 participants will be able to familiarize
themselves with the evaluation criteria through usage of the
evaluation software, which will be released along with the training
data.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO THE CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:
     Organizations within and outside the U.S. are invited to respond
to this call for participation.  Minimal requirements include
development before the dry-run test of a system that can accept texts
without manual preprocessing, process them without human intervention,
and output templates in the expected format.  Organizations should
plan on allocating at least three person-months of effort for
participation in the evaluation and conference; a substantially greater
level of effort is likely to be needed in order to achieve relatively
high performance.  It is understood that organizations will vary with
respect to experience with information extraction, domain
expertise/engineering, resources, contractual demands/expectations,
etc.  Recognition of such factors will be made in any analyses of the
results. 
     Organizations wishing to participate in the evaluation and
conference must respond by submitting a summary of their text analysis
approach and a system architecture description, not to exceed five
pages in total.  The summary should include the strengths of
the approach and highlight its innovative aspects.  Acceptance or
rejection of each application will be determined on the basis of a
technical assessment by the program committee.  The body of the
application will serve as the basis for an article in the conference
proceedings.  Participants will have the opportunity to make revisions
prior to publication.
     The application must also include the following information:
     1.  Domain (choose only one)
          a. Joint ventures
          b. Microelectronics
     2.  Language (choose one or two)
          a.  English
          b.  Japanese
     3.  An estimate of the degree of coverage and/or length of time
         under development of existing software to be applied to the 
         MUC-5 task in the selected language(s) and domain.
     4.  Primary point of contact for notification of
         acceptance/rejection of application.  Please include name, 
         surface and email addresses, and phone and fax numbers.
     Those organizations wishing to request funding to supplement
their own resources must provide a second statement, not to exceed two
pages.  This statement should include an estimate of the amount of
funding available from other sources to support participation in this
work and a specification of the amount of funding desired and the
minimal acceptable amount.  In addition, it should describe any
software to be used for MUC-5 that the organization is willing to
deliver to NRaD and MUC participants for possible redistribution.
Please indicate clearly whether the organization is interested in
participating in MUC-5 even if no funding is available.  Evaluators of
funding requests will not include any MUC system developers.
     RESPONSES THAT INCLUDE FUNDING REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY
JANUARY 3, 1993.  THE DEADLINE FOR OTHER RESPONSES IS JANUARY 15,
1993.  All participants are expected to have Internet access and to
be able to do electronic file transfer via anonymous FTP.  All
responses should be submitted to the program chair via email to
sundheim@nosc.mil.  If Internet access is currently unavailable,
responses may be sent via surface mail to Beth Sundheim, NCCOSC/NRaD,
Code 444, San Diego, CA 92152-5000, and if a quick reply to questions
is needed, the program chair may be reached by phone at 619/553-4145.

Subject:    Data formats for annotated corpora

Helmut Feldweg asked:

"Is TEI merely a format for information interchange or is it feasible
to do basic analysis (frequencies, concordances, distributional
analysis etc.) with this format?" 

He also said his team was 
"facing the quesiton whether to do the annotation in a SGML-based
TEI-conformant format or on the basis of a vertikalized text with one
wordform plus annotations per line."

As European editor of the TEI I am rather depressed by the fact that the
TEI has clearly been so unsuccessful in getting across  the nature of
its objectives! I hope you will allow me to elaborate a little on the
subject.  First, the TEI is very emphatically a format for information
interchange. (and, by the way, I don't see why the word "merely" goes in
there!) If you want to build a resource which is usable with different
pieces of software, or the same piece of software in different computing
environments, you *must* have some sort of interchange format. Resources
like corpora cost lots of time and money to create,  so I hope that
*all* in "corpora-land" have some concern for re-usability. That is one
of the reasons for the existence of the TEI and why it is seen as so
important by research funders as well as researchers.

Contrary to what Dr Feldweg seems to imply in the sentences quoted
above, the TEI format is not limited in its application to interchange
only. It uses SGML for the very good reason that SGML is a defined
international standard for which general purpose software is around now
and will continue to be around for many years to come. That means also
that more and more SGML-aware software will become available, for the
kinds of specialized activities which delight the readers of this list.
But an honest answer to the question "Is there a KWIC concordance
generator which will directly process TEI-tagged texts?" now, as of
December 1992, is *NO*. 

Let me say why I don't think this is a disastrous state of affairs:

- the TEI recommendations are not yet finalized, so any software
developer who claims to 'support TEI' is using the word "support" in
some rather general sense which needs to be more exactly specified

- the general principles of the TEI are however very clearly and
straightforwardly expressed so that writing software which conforms 
to them is easy (provided you understand SGML)

- few people want to use a KWIC concordance *only* If you put your data
into the format that the KWIC program wants, then you can't get it
formatted properly; if you put it into the format that the formatter
wants, then the KWIC program is confused... so you wind up having to
invent an interchange format all of your own anyway. In which case, why
not use SGML from the start?


But enough of these generalities! Let me try to answer some of Dr
Feldweg's specific questions.

>Are there tools which allow me to deal
>with an SGML-tagged text as easily as I can manipulate a vertikalized
>text with grep, awk, icon and similar tools?

Yes. Use the publicdomain SGML parser sgmls to produce a normalized form
of your document, which can be piped into whatever set of unix tools you
like. sgmls (which you can download from lots of ftp servers, not
excluding this one, I think!) outputs a very simple form of an SGML
document (technically known as the ESIS) in which all the various
aspects of an SGML document that are variable have been normalized, (see
further below) thus making it very easy to pipe into any tool you like. 

Two trivial examples:

   sgmls foo.bar | \
       awk '/^-/ {print substr($0,2)}' | \
       sed 's/\\n/ /' | tr -ds ' ' '\012' | sort -u

will give you a sorted list of the tokens in the contents of the SGML 
file foo.bar (i.e. just the text, without the markup or attributes)

   sgmls foo.bar | \
       awk '/^^\(BLORT/,/^\)BLORT/ {if ($0 ~ /~-/) print substr($0,2)}' | \
       sed 's/\\n/ /' | tr -ds ' ' '\012' | sort -u

will do the same thing, but only for the tokens in content marked as
being a BLORT (i.e. between <blort>  and </blort> in the conventional
SGML format)

Why should you use the SGML parser? Let's suppose that you're using a
simple dtd (or only using a small amount of a complex one) in which
documents consist of paragraphs that consist of sentences. You are
following the TEI and so you have marked the sentences with the S tag
and the paras with the P tag. You also want identifiers on the
sentences. So you have an input text like this
  <p>
   <s id=N1>The cat sat on the hippopotamus.
   <s id=N2 lang=FR>L'&eacute;tat, c'est moi.
Or like this
  <p><s 
iD=N1>The cat sat on the hippopotamus.</>
   <S id=N2 lAnG=FR>L'&eacute;tat, c'est moi.</S></P>
(I've arbitrarily taken some liberties with the tagging in order to show
the range of possibilities which all produce *exactly the same* ESIS --
i.e. the same document)

The parser does three things: it expands the entity references (so, the
'&eacute' will turn into whatever the right character for your machine
is); it validates the tags (so, if you have spelled 'P' with a q at the
startby mistake it can complain); and it outputs a regularised version
of the document (so, all the tagnames appear in uppercase, the end-tags
are supplied etc etc).

That's probably enough low-grade techy stuff for this note, for now.


>Has anybody *worked* with annotated texts in TEI-format?

Since, see above, the TEI Guidelines are not yet finalized this would be
difficult. However, there are many examples of projects which are
applying the TEI principles and getting real experience of using the
draft recommendations. If by 'annotated texts' you mean 'texts with
word-class tagging attached', I know of two or three projects, of which
the British National Corpus is probably the largest.

>It is our understanding that the final product will be an
>TEI-conformant SGML-tagged text. The question is whether this is the
>right format to use during data preparation.

For data PREPARATION one should definitely use the most convenient tool
at ones disposal. That might be word perfect (which, by the bye,
recently announced a beta test of an SGML-aware version), emacs ,
pagemaker... Some people like to define abbreviatory macros or
conventions to save keystrokes one way, and some another; what's crucial
(I think) is that the distinctions made by  the local data preparation
format can be straightforwardly mapped onto the interchange format. I
would suggest that 'data capture' is one of the many processor-specific
application formats amongst which the interchange format mediates,
albeit a particularly important one.

I hope this discussion will be of interest to your readers, and is
also helpful to Dr Feldweg.

My colleague Lou Burnard has already responded to this query, I think,
but I'd like to throw in my own two cents' worth as well.

>We are about to prepare an annotated corpus of German and are facing
>the quesiton whether to do the annotation in a SGML-based

Whether you are using the TEI DTDs or not, SGML provides a much firmer
basis for reusable text than a verticalized format.  The vertical
formats I am familiar with are all very simple to process, but all are
also fundamentally non-extensible.  If I discover, the year after next,
that I would like to enrich my text by adding a new type of annotation,
the vertical format is much less likely to support this process than is
SGML.  This is true, I think, even for word-by-word annotation, but it
is critically true for phrase-level annotation and other phenomena which
don't map one-to-one with the tokens of the source text.  (How many
complications and compromises are required in the Brown and LOB corpora
by the limitation of annotation to the token level!  The 'New York-born
financier' would not cause problems for annotation if one were not
forced to annotate the three tokens 'New', 'York-born', and 'financier'
-- similarly the Queen of England's taxes could be annotated properly,
with the apostrophe and S applying to the NP, not just to the last word,
if phrase-structure annotation were aided, instead of being impeded, by
the notation.

If resources are to be reusable, they must be represented in a notation
which can support their enrichment and modification over a period of
time.  SGML is far and away the most suitable notation now publicly
defined, for such enrichment.

>Is TEI merely a format for information interchange or is it feasible
>to do basic analysis (frequencies, concordances, distributional
>analysis etc.) with this format? As we do not want to spend time for

The TEI Guidelines define an interchange format.  This allows those
who already have a strong commitment to some locally supported format
to support the TEI encoding scheme for import and export of files
to and from their local format.  It also provides an opaque interface
behind which one can optimize or simplify or otherwise do exactly as
one wants.  (In just the same way, ISO 646, ISO 10646, and ANSI X3.4
(ASCII) do not define character sets for use in computers or on data
storage devices; they only define character sets for interchange.  What
the CPU, disk drive, or tape drive store internally is their own business
as long as they provide ASCII at the interface to other devices.  On
high-density tapes, in fact, I am told ASCII bytes are *not* used --
instead, other codes, optimized for high-density reading and writing,
are used.  Many devices, however, find it simpler to store internally
exactly what they receive and transmit at their external interfaces, so
your RAM and disk drives may well use ASCII internally, just as some
tape drives do.)

Just as ASCII, though defined as an interchange format, is also
(intentionally) suitable for internal use, so the TEI tag set, though
formally defined for interchange, also tries to avoid features which
might make it wholly unsuitable for local use.  As Lou has explained,
the output of sgmls, a public-domain SGML parser based on the ARCSGML
engine, can be used quite profitably with existing pipeline tools to do
useful work.  So I submit to you that the answer to your question is
yes, it *is* feasible to do basic analysis and manipulation using the
TEI format.  Personally, I think it's more feasible, and easier, with
SGML than with any other text format I know, because the logical model
of text supported by SGML (and represented in the element structure
information set, or ESIS, mentioned by Lou) is so much stronger and more
informative than the simple (simplistic) stream model supported by many
other formats.

Not yet, but I am confident that they are coming.  If those now developing
stream-oriented tools for their own use can be induced to share them with
others, we can have a useful library in very short order.  Obviously one
useful filter would take an sgmls data stream and verticalize it so one
can work with it using other existing tools.

>Has anybody *worked* with annotated texts in TEI-format?

Among the projects which have worked with texts using SGML and tag sets
taken from or based on the first version of the TEI guidelines are the
British National Corpus, the Stockholm-Umeaa Swedish Text Corpus, and
the Brown Women Writers Project; the Perseus Project at Harvard uses
SGML (not specifically TEI-derived) internally, for all manipulation and
annotation, and distributes HyperCard materials derived from the SGML.

>It is our understanding that the final product will be an
>TEI-conformant SGML-tagged text. The question is whether this is the
>right format to use during data preparation.

This depends on your local environment, as Lou has pointed out.  In
general, if you are making a choice more or less from scratch, and are
not already locked in to a format, I would urge you very strongly to
consider using SGML as your local storage format, from which you can
transduce data into application-specific formats required by existing
applications.

The list of application programs which understand an ad hoc vertical
format will grow only as you yourselves, or other users of your data,
write programs for it.  The list of application programs which
understand an SGML file will grow, and grow, and continue to grow,
independent of your local software development budget.  Storing your
data in SGML is the best way to ensure that you can use these
applications as they arrive.  Commercial vendors very seldom aim to
support research work with their software; but when they support SGML,
researchers using suitably designed SGML tag sets will be able to
exploit commercial software much more easily than is now the case.
Isn't it about time we were able to take advantage of commercial
software development instead of being forced to develop everything on
our own because the research-oriented market is too small for commercial
developers to take seriously?

Subject:    reply to FELDWEG data format of annotated corpora

Because I think the discussion about the data format of annotated corpora
is of general interest, I answer to Mr. Feldweg here in the list, though
his institute is only a few hundred meters from mine, but until now we
weren't in contact.

There is no question: using a generic markup like SGML or TEI is always
better than a vertikalized format (like Lou Burnard and Sperberg-MaQueen
mentioned in their contributions). 
My experience is, that it is not necessary to use exactly the proposals of
SGML and TEI, but to use the idea of them in a very strict way:
that is, you have to think about the structure of the *content* of your text,
and then tagging each element in your text with a distinct content (i.e.
object language, reference, grammatical analysis, etc.) with an 
unequivocal sign or string (i.e. like SGML <....> ). So you can
be sure that later you can make with this text by  converting with
a program what ever you want.
In this field I have experience in several projects of different fields:
textcritical editions, lexicography, linquistics. In volume 4, 1992 of
the periodical Historcal Social Research (which comes out at the
beginning of 1993) there will be an article treating this theme.

Feldweg asked for KWIC and frequency programs.
A very strong tool to do this kind of analysis also with SGML-tagged texts
is the TUebingen System of Text-Processing Programs TUSTEP. Not only for
KWIC and frequency analysis but also for data retrieval in tagged texts
and for converting programs TUSTEP is a very strong tool which runs under
UNIX and MS-DOS identically (also: VMS, MVS, VM, BS2000).

In your institut, Helmut Feldweg, TUSTEP is in use exactly for this purpose.

I think there is no reason for Lou Burnard to be "rather depressed".
As I said in my original posting, the final textual product of our
enterprise will be a TEI-conformant SGML-tagged text. That should make
Lou happy.

The question was not whether a verticalized format is better than
SGML/TEI. I was already convinced that SGML/TEI is the better system!
My concern was, and still is, the feasibililty to *work* with this
format *here and now*, and I have learned from the responses to my
posting, that whereas some software is already around which allows
processing of SGML-texts by converting the SGML-format to some other
format (like sgmls and TUSTEP), software with direct support of this
format is still to come.

Dear Mr Feldweg,
let us continue discussing via Bergen.
I think in your new reply you misunderstand a sentence of my message.

  > A very strong tool to do this kind of analysis also with SGML-tagged texts
  > is the TUebingen System of Text-Processing Programs TUSTEP. Not only for
  > KWIC and frequency analysis but also for data retrieval in tagged texts

I wanted to express to things in one sentence and you didn't get it.
First: TUSTEP is a tool - not a ready program to use - for making KWIC-index
very easily and rapidly, and - if you want and you put some parameters
to your TUSTEP-KWIC-program - it can use as data input a file in 
SGML-format. The only condition is, that the tagging of your text
keeps all the informations you want to interpret with the KWIC- and
frequency-programs.
Second: TUSTEP is not only a tool for KWIC. You can do a lot of
things with it: comparing versions, preparing editions, writing 
algorithmic programs, and - this was the second thing I said
in my sentence - you can write converting programs with TUSTEP, if
you need to do so.

You write:
  > software with direct support of this
  > format is still to come.
The question which arises here is, what do you mean by "direct support".
Do you want to push one buttom and get one result which the program designer
has decided you need this, or is the work of a scholar to ask new questions
and therefore to make new solutions (with the help of available tools)?

Subject:    Query: Software tools for bi/multilingual corpora

Dear Colleagues,

Currently, I am working on semiotic aspects of language for special
purposes (LSP) including, but not limited to, technical communication
and translation, computationally tractable methods for writers and 
translators, natural language processing (parsing) and computer-assisted
translation and composition.

The ability to somehow  compare texts in DIFFERENT
languages is of crucial importance in translation studies; i.e. linking
together parts of texts, which would be considered to
be correspondences both on a sentential and a suprasentential
level, as well as on a global text level within a bilingual
or multilingual corpus. 

Does anybody know of any available software tools for this purpose? I am 
aware of the work by Eugenio Picchi and his group in Pisa, by
Ken Church et. al. at AT&T, and by Poul Soeren Kjaersgaard in Odense.
The work done by Victor Sadler and the DLT group in Utrecht on
a Bilingual Knowledge Bank is also very interesting.
However, none of these seems to be immediately applicable to 
studies in LSP.

I do have some notion of how such linking could be done, but that
would require extensive programming, for example in Prolog.
That is why it seems reasonable first to make a few enquires and
see if any tools of this kind already exist.

Yours,
Arne Larsson

Subject:           Re: Query: Software tools for bi/multilingual corpora

As part of the Translators Workbench (TWB) ESPRIT project we are
extending the facilities of our Machine-Assisted Terminology
Elicitation (MATE) system to take advantage of parallel texts in
different languages, to help establish foreign language equivalences and
so on.  We are using the term "shadow corpora" to cover this work -
there is an original text which has possibly several translations
(shadows).

Currently MATE uses a variety of concordance, collocation and 
frequency techniques to establish LSP from corpora of technical
texts - our aim is to extend its functionality over the next year
to cover shadow corpora.  MATE has been developed using Prolog and
runs on Unix under X-Windows.  A subset of the tools has been ported
to PCs under MS Windows, and we hope to port the full function system
over the next year.

Needless to say, we are keen to hear from anyone with ideas on how
to exploit "shadow corpora".  I am the principal system developer,
so queries or suggestions of a linguistic nature are best directed
to Andrea Davies here (A.Davies@mcs.surrey.ac.uk).

Many thanks,
Paul.

I have no helpful suggestions at the moment, but I am most
interested in hearing from you as the work goes on. I have 
wanted to do something quite a lot like your project, and
(naturally) I think it is a fine plan. When some of the dust
settles here after the holidays, perhaps we can email at
greater length. Meanwhile, anything you can send me about
the project would be welcomed.

I cannot answer your question but got interested in your research. I've recently
finished a contrastive textlinguistic analysis of LSP texts in Finnish and 
English (academic texts) and would be very interested in seeing how far if at 
all the kinds of analytical tools I have used in mainly qualitative study could 
be applied to corpus study. So I'd like to know what sorts of variables you have
in mind at suprasentential and global ext levels.

Subject:    overview of formats?



corpora cognoscente,

  forgive me if this seems naive, but this seems like the place to ask this.
if not, please give me a nudge in the proper direction.

  i am in the process of preparing a series of proposals which will include
the creation of a corpus of textual data.  i work in education and i expect
to collect machine-readable school materials from K-12 students in several
countries and several languages.  i expect to work with several 100 megabytes
of material (probably less than a gigabyte), some of it collected from
student network activities (both WAN and LAN), and some of it scanned in from
hardcopy materials.

  i joined this list to learn the technical features of corpus construction,
but going has been slower than i hoped.  in the past weeks i have followed
up on your source references to sgmls, at least enough to find the ISO 8879
references to 'standard generalized markup language'.  i presume i can follow
this onward to determine if it will help me collect and distribute my work
on the networks.

  i have looked through the corpora file index for titles which might provide
me with an overview of the common formats for a textual corpus.  i am hoping
that someone out there will assist me with this.  how do i look up the
meaning of 'TEI-compliance' or 'TUSTEP' which i have seen referred to here?
do you all have an intro textbook on these things?  or is there a network
source for this kind of information?  i need something that gives an overview
to determine what will fill my needs then pointers to enough technical
details to follow through with implementation.

  thanks for any assistance you may give me,
                                            stan

Nope, exactly the right place to ask, IMHO.

This sounds fascinating: I can think of lots of people who would like to
see this kind of project developed further. Do you have any kind of
prospectus or project description yet?

IMHO (again) SGML would be a good way to proceed. You can certainly plow
onwards by yourself, but it's heavy going in the early stages.
I found there was no substitute for sitting down with some of the more
experienced people and discussing the project in detail. A pity you
missed the SGML '93 meeting in October: I don't know when the next
gathering of cognoscenti will be but the ALLC/ACH 93 meeting is in
Georgetown, DC in early June, and there will be a lot of expertise

There is a TEI-L@UICVM (listserv) for the Text Encoding Initiative which
is worth joining. I don't know of a list for TUSTEP (what's TUSTEP?)

SGML is a non-trivial concept, but worth the effort. You will need some
bucks for software and hardware, possibly quite a lot of them, and a lot
of manual help to get the text into usable form. Please keep us in touch
with developments.

To everybody who would like to use SGML in real life,
I would suggest a book by Eric van Herwijnen of CERN:

van Herwijnen, Eric, Practical SGML,
Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1990.
ISBN 0-7923-0635-X.

The author covers a lot of ground, from the basics to SGML applications,
handling math and graphics, and implementations, all the way to using
SGML for databases, CALS and EDI. The book contains even an Appendix E
entitled 'How to read ISO 8879'.

I'm myselft setting out to do corpus work in translation studies
using a bi/multilingual corpus consisting of aligned texts in technical
sublanguages (Finnish, Swedish, English, perhaps also German), so
I would greatly appreciate being kept up to date with Stan's work
(if possible).

Yours,
Arne

Don't know if there is a network source other than the one you're using
(viz. the rest of us out here), but I can at least tell you that the
Text Encoding Initiative markup language is defined in its publication
Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (TEI P2), which
is being published chapter by chapter as they become ready.  New
chapters are announced, and relevant topics may be discussed, on the
list TEI-L@UICVM (or on the internet TEI-L@uicvm.uic.edu), which is a
Listserv list which functions much the way this one (corpora-L) does.
To subscribe, send mail to LISTSERV@UICVM containing the line

   subscribe tei-l Stan Kulikowski

(those of you other than Mr. Kulikowski are encouraged, of course, to
use your own names rather than his).

The formal definition definition of TEI compliance is to be included in
a chapter which is not yet published (and given the press of other
chapters probably won't be published for several months) but the TEI
markup language can be used without reference to strict definitions of
compliance.  If you really really want to know about compliance
issues, send me a note asking for a copy of document TEI ML W43,
which contains the current definition of TEI conformance.

TUSTEP is the TUebingen System for TExt Processing, developed over the
past twenty years or so by Wilhelm Ott and his associates at the
University of Tuebingen.  It is a toolkit of small functional programs a
lot like Unix filters; it has a great many virtues, including a
commitment to modularity and generality of tools which anyone must
admire.  Like Unix, however, it seems to inspire and possibly to require
an almost religious commitment in its users; most problematic for me
personally is that because it uses its own unique file structure, Tustep
files can be reliably edited only with the Tustep editor.  The
circumstances of its development make this design feature perfectly
understandable, but still it makes me nervous.  It runs under a
number of operating systems including DOS and some mainframe systems,
and for further information you can contact Wilhelm Ott at Tuebingen.
My email address for him is Ott@mailserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de  ---
but this may be out of date.

Hope this is some help.  If there is some more general treatment of formats
in common use for corpora, I hope someone will mention it.

(This was originally sent only to to Stan Kulikowski in reponse to his
"overview of formats" query, however, I thought there might be others out
there who might want some of this info...)

In regards to...

| and distribute my work on the networks.

This is indeed the single most important aspect of your corpus creation. To achieve
insurance of longevity and interchange capability it is vital that you use a 
standard, easy to use format... which is SGML.

| meaning of 'TEI-compliance' or 'TUSTEP' which i have seen referred to here?
| do you all have an intro textbook on these things?  or is there a network
| source for this kind of information?  i need something that gives an overview...
  
Ok, first of all, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a body that puts out
_guidelines_ for tagging certain kinds of texts, such as poetry, tables of
content, etc. So don't worry so much about being TEI-conformant ... concentrate
on being SGML-conformant. Inevitably, the TEI guidelines are somewhat subjective, 
although they can be helpful. This year's edition has not come out yet; however, 
it's called _Guidelines for the Encoding and Interchange of Machine-Readable Texts_,
and Michael Sperberg-McQueen and Lou Burnard are editors.

As for an intro book, the BIBLE for SGML is Charles F. Goldfarb's _The SGML Handbook_
which you cannot be without. He includes the entirety of ISO 8879, with comments
(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990. ISBN: 0-19-853737-9). However, it's fairly 
technical and I would suggest _also_ getting Eric van Herwijnen's _Practical
SGML_, and read them simultaneously (Kluwer Academic Publishers, London, 1990.
ISBN: 0-7923-0635-X).

For network information, there's a newsgroup called "comp.text.sgml" which you
can post to, plus an ftp sight at "ftp.ifi.uio.no".

| ...to collect machine-readable school materials from K-12 students in several
| countries and several languages.

Just wanted to add that since you're in the tricky business of multilingual
texts, be very careful with your 8-bit (non-ASCII) characters.
If you don't have 8-bit fonts available, then make sure whatever character
mappings you use are _consistent_, so that they can me mapped over easily
later. Also, if you can, use the ISO 8-bit sets that are designed specifically
for this purpose (Goldfarb lists most of them in the back of his book), because
this will be a _very_ important part of your texts being SGML conformant.

And lastly,

| ...in the past weeks i have followed up on your source references to sgmls...

Just in case you didn't know, "sgmls" is a free sgml parser, which you can ftp 
from the site I mentioned above.                                               

Hope this helped a little. Or maybe you knew all that. If so, happy tagging.

Dear Colleague,

     The development and ease of use of computer (especially PC) facilities in
recent years means that there has been a move beyond the large carefully set-up
corpora held on mainframes to a growing "cottage industry" of users who have set
up their own corpora for their own purposes.  These purposes may reflect an
interest not simply in linguistic research but specifically in pedagogic ends.
It is in the belief that there is a good number of such small-scale, personally
assembled corpora out there that we are attempting to collate information about
them, ultimately in a paper for publication.   Hence the questionnaire which
follows.
     Its aim is to collect information about the nature and structure of
collections of text in machine-readable form and specifications of hardware and
software tools. This information will be available to interested parties and is
intended to provide a basis for discussion and exchange.
     By corpus, we mean broadly a text collection.   We are particularly
interested in corpora of present-day English which are (or could be) used in the
teaching of English as a Second or Foreign Language.  If you are not personally
involved in the compilation of such a machine-readable corpus, could you pass
the survey to others or suggest their names to us.
     We would hope to complete the results of the survey by April 1993;
depending on the extent of the response we may come back to you for more detail.

     We would like to thank you in advance for your help and we'd be happy to
hear any suggestions from you.

  i am in the process of preparing a series of proposals which will include
the creation of a corpus of textual data.  i work in education and i expect
to collect machine-readable school materials from K-12 students in several
countries and several languages.  i expect to work with several 100 megabytes
of material (probably less than a gigabyte), some of it collected from
student network activities (both WAN and LAN), and some of it scanned in from
hardcopy materials.

   I agree this is a very worth while and interesting project. For the last 
year I have been trying to markup 120,000 words of students informal-
writing-to-learn mathematics. The idiosyncratic formatting of each piece of 
writing, the use of arrows to link bits of the text, the lack of sentence 
structure, and the use personal ideograms, has frustrated every attempt to 
reduce the text to a structured machine readable form. The decision as to 
what information is preserved in the coding and what is lost depends on the 
use to be made of the corpus. In education the main interest, it seems to 
me, is development. If this is the focus, then standard tools don't 
handle non-standard texts all that well. 
    I am at present meeting this same problem in a more technical setting. 
I have been trying to plan the construction of a corpus of 
mathematical writing. To do this sensibly I need to preserve the 
semantics of the mathematical expressions within the text. I can't see 
anyway of doing this. (As far as I can gather the group working on the TEI 
standards for coding mathematics is using a typsetting model rather than a 
structural model, as used implemented in the rest of SGML. This is all 
pretty fuzzy to me - I will follow up the Van Herwijnen book.) Does anyone 
have any suggestions ?  
    I joined this list for much the same reasons as 
Stan. I'm not an expert but need to develop corpora to carry through with 
research questions. To date the list has focussed on where rescourses are. 
Stan's request focusses on the how of constructing rescourses. I would 
really appreciate seeing more of this sort of discussion.
  
   PS Stan,
 if you are interested in using Australian data, there are large amounts of 
k-6 writing on LANs in schools here. I have been wanting to collect some of 
this for a while and I would be happy to have a reason and a deadline for 
doing it.

Clarification may be in order.  The TEI work group on mathematical
formulae has not, in fact, developed a tag set for mathematics at all.

This is not because they were too lazy or too unimaginative to do so;
instead, they decided in very short order that one thing definitely high
on the list of Things The World Does Not Need Right Now was Yet Another
SGML Tag Set for Mathematics.  Their net recommendation, therefore, was
for the TEI to use one of the existing schemes; best of all, to wait
until the current effort at reconciling the major existing schemes has
achieved success, and use *that one*.  (The schemes now being reconciled
include, to the best of my recollection, those developed by the
Euromath(s) project and by the Association of American Publishers, and
that included in ISO TR 9573.)  All of these do include some largely
typographic constructs, though the ISO tag set, thanks to Anders
Berglund, seems to allow reasonably clear structural markup for at least
basic algebra and probably somewhat beyond (sorry --- it's been too long
since I read it, I can't remember it all) The Euromaths project seems to
have debated at some length whether to take a typographic or a
semantic/structural/whatever-you-call-it approach, and decided that
practicing mathematicians would find the typographic tagging more
useful.  (Before you start crying, remember that practicing
mathematicians don't always use well established notation:  it's
research, remember, so sometimes they must be inventing new notation,
recombining existing typographic effects/signals and extending the
already massive ambiguity of most existing typographic effects in
mathematics.)  For people who do not see their normal use of mathematics
as involving the invention of new notation, and who in fact seldom use
any notation not in common use for the last few decades --- this seems
to include 90% of the users of mathematics I know --- it would be much
more useful to have a useful SGML notation for the constructs
encountered in (say) algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus (and
first-order predicate calculus, if you count logic as part of math).
With any luck, the coming reconciliation of AAP, Euromath, and the ISO
tag set will include something of the sort.  (If Andrew Waywood's corpus
includes serious mathematical literature, though, he will presumably
need to try to capture *both* the semantics and the presentation of the
notation actually used.  Good luck!)

It is gratifying to see people's thoughts turning, whenever SGML comes
up, to the TEI.  But for better or worse the major activity in SGML
markup for mathematics is happening elsewhere.

                         Call For Papers
              Special Issue on Text Categorization 
             ACM Transactions on Information Systems

                  Submissions due: June 1, 1993

   Text categorization is the classification of units of natural
language text with respect to a set of pre-existing categories.
Reducing an infinite set of possible natural language inputs to a
small set of categories is a central strategy in computational systems
that process natural language.  Some uses of text categorization have
been:

       --To assign subject categories to documents in support of text
retrieval and library organization, or to aid the human assignment of
such categories.
       --To route messages, news stories, or other continuous streams
of texts to interested recipients.
       --As a component in natural language processing systems, to
filter out nonrelevant texts and parts of texts, to route texts to
category-specific processing mechanisms, or to extract limited forms
of information.
       --As an aid in lexical analysis tasks, such as word sense
disambiguation.
       --To categorize nontextual entities by textual annotations, for
instance to assign people to occupational categories based on free
text responses to survey questions.

   ACM Transactions on Information Systems is the leading forum for
presenting research on text processing systems.  For this special
issue we encourage the submission of high quality technical
descriptions of algorithms and methods for text categorization.
Experiments comparing alternative methods are especially welcome, as
are results on deploying systems into regular use.
