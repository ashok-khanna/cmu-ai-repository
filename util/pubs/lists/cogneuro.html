The Cognitive Neuroscience Mailing List is a way to discuss phenomena
at the interface of cognitive science (broadly construed) and biology.
The discussion is scientific, multidisciplinary, and academic.

Topics include:

	o behavioral aspects of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology;
	o biological aspects of particular sets of behaviors;
	o the neuropsychology of ecology, ethology, genetics,
	  ontogeny, endocrinology, info. theory, and pharmacology; 

	o books, papers, research directions, and new results;
	o new imaging, simulation, and measurement techniques;
	o curricula, graduate programs, jobs, zeitgeist, and funding.

"Behavior" above is an attempt at a theory-independent, catch-all term
for cognition, emotion, volition, and meaningful action in humans and
other animals, both normal and abnormal, including subjective reports.

Since that is a lot of territory to cover, primary emphasis tends to
be:

	o on science (measurable phenomena) more than philosophy,
	o on the field itself more than its implications, and
	o on approaching particular natural phenomena from many
	  perspectives simultaneously rather than approaching many
	  phenomena from a particular perspective or technique.
