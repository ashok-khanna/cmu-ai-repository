Gentle uncertainty researcher:

Note in the announcements that the papers deadline for this summer's
conference is a few weeks off.  The AI in Medicine papers deadline is
June 1st, mercifully distant from the summer's conferences deadlines.
As usual, conference and journal calls, general announcements,
abstracts of new articles, and books, are solicited for the digest.
Also, larger items, such as articles and code can be submitted for the
ftp-able archive. Please attach a text description with them that can
be posted in the digest.

I am happy that the signal to noise in this list is high, directly
reflecting the items received, and not due to my editing out submissions.
Much thanks to all who took the time to submitt.

                           Final Call for Papers
                    Deadline for submission: Feb. 14, 1992!!!

         THE EIGHTH CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                             Stanford, California
                     July 17-19, 1992 (following AAAI-92)


The eighth annual Conference on Uncertainty in AI is devoted to the
advance of artificial intelligence methods expressly accounting for
uncertainty in beliefs.  The conference's scope covers the full gamut
of approaches to automated and interactive reasoning and decision making
under uncertainty, including both qualitative and numeric methods.

We invite original contributions on fundamental theoretical issues, on
computational techniques for uncertain reasoning, and on novel
applications of such theories and technologies to challenging
problem-solving tasks.

Topics of particular interest include:
 -  Foundations of uncertainty concepts 
 -  Representations of uncertain knowledge and their semantics
 -  Automated planning and decision making under uncertainty
 -  Abduction and diagnosis
 -  Algorithms for uncertain inference
 -  Control of reasoning and real-time architectures
 -  Construction of uncertainty models from experts, data, or knowledge
    bases 
 -  Pooling of uncertain evidence
 -  Belief updating and inconsistency handling in uncertain knowledge
    bases 
 -  Explanation and summarization of uncertain information
 -  Engineering principles for applications of uncertain reasoning

Papers will be carefully refereed for originality, significance,
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.  Papers may be accepted
for presentation in plenary or poster sessions.  All accepted papers
will be included in the published proceedings.  Outstanding student
papers may be selected for special distinction.

Five copies of each paper should be sent to reach one of the Program
Co-Chairs by February 14, 1992.  The first page should include a
descriptive title, the names, addresses, and student status of all
authors, a brief abstract, and salient keywords or other topic
indicators.  Acceptance notices will be sent by April 3, 1992, and final
camera-ready papers, incorporating reviewers' suggestions, will be
due approximately five weeks later.  There will be an eight-page limit
on proceedings papers, with a few extra pages available for a fee.

         ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE JOURNAL

                     Special Issue on
   Probabilistic and Decision-Theoretic Systems in Medicine


Papers are sought for a special issue of the journal Artificial
Intelligence in Medicine on the use of probability and decision
theory to develop medical decision support systems. The term
"medical decision support system" is intended to be interpreted
broadly. Papers should contain original research contributions.
Both theoretical and applied work are sought. Topics of specific
interest include:

  o Acquisition of decision-theoretic models from medical
    experts. Acquisition of probabilities from medical experts
    and/or databases.

  o Theory and application of Bayesian belief networks,
    influence diagrams, as well as other representations. The
    integration of representations and/or inference methods.

  o Diagnosis and data gathering

  o Decision-theoretic therapy planning

  o Probabilistic causality

  o Probabilistic temporal reasoning

  o Decision making in dynamic medical environments

  o Efficient inference algorithms

  o Control of probabilistic and decision-theoretic inference

  o Machine-generated explanations of the application of
    probabilistic and decision-theoretic models

  o Results of applying a probabilistic or decision-theoretic
    system in a medical area

The above list of topics of interest is not intended to be
exhaustive.

Papers will be refereed for their significance, originality,
quality, and clarity. Three copies of a submitted paper must
arrive at the address below by June 1, 1992. The author(s)
should attach the following information to each copy of
the paper: postal address, email address, telephone number,
and fax number. Papers must follow the format specified by the
Guide for Authors of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
journal. The Guide for Authors is available from the address
below.

Subject: New Book: Representing and Reasoning with Probabilistic Knowledge


Representing and Reasoning with Probabilistic Knowledge
by Fahiem Bacchus, The MIT Press, 233 pages,
ISBN 0262-02317-2 $29.95 (U.S.)
============================================================

Probabilistic information has many uses in an intelligent
system. This book explores logical formalisms for 
representing and reasoning with probabilistic information
that will be of particular interest to researchers in
nonmonotonic reasoning, applications of probabilities,
and knowledge representation. It demonstrates that 
probabilities are not limited to particular applications,
like expert systems; they have an important role to 
play in the formal design and specification of intelligent
systems in general.

The book draws attention to two distinct notions of
probability---one involving degrees of belief,
e.g., "I think that the probability of the Chicago Bulls winning
their next game is 0.9," the other involving statistics, e.g.,
"the Chicago Bulls have won 75% of their games so far this season." 
Two distinct logics are constructed with different semantics
suitable for representing each type of probability. These
logics have the ability to represent an extensive variety of 
qualitative assertions, eliminating requirements for exact 
point-valued probabilties. Furthermore, they can represent 
first-order assertions: they are first-order probabilistic logics.
Also presented are powerful proof theories which give a
formal specification for a class of reasoning which subsumes
and integrates most of the probabilistic reasoning schemes 
so far developed in AI.

Using the new tools a system of direct inference is also proposed
which connects an agent's statistical knowledge to its degrees of 
belief. The book demonstrates how this mechanism can be applied
to yield a powerful and intuitively satisfying system of defeasible
or default reasoning.
