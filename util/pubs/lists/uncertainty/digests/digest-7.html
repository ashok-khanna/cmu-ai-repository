The uncertainty list digest is about automatic reasoning under uncertainty.

This issue contains a few things that have crossed my desk, in
addition to e-mail traffic. I encourage readers also to send in items of
interest to the rest of the community, such as reviews and listings of
recent papers and books, conferences, both past and upcoming, and
funding related items. I will try to make up the deficit with items I
am aware of from other places.

I have been talking to sumex about disk space for ftp access, so that
we can start a library to exchange source code. Details will be
forthcoming. Please use the address

agosta@sumex-aim.stanford.edu

for both submissions and for address change requests.

Subject: Measures of link strength
 
Hello,
 
I am currently doing research on the notion of assigning a "strength"
to BN links based on the link matrix (contingency table) of the link.
The strength of the link is based on the maximum change in beliefs of 
the child node, for any change in beliefs of the parent. The strengths 
may be chained for links in series (with a special rule for nodes that 
are the child of two or more nodes), and global limits for the maximum 
change in belief in any node of a complex network may be made
under some conditions.
I am wondering if anyone else has worked on this problem, or knows of
someone who has.
                   Thank You,  Brent

Subject: Two books of note

Thomas L. Dean & Michael P. Wellman
Planning and Control
(San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann, 1991)
ISBN 1-55860-209-7 

Phillip Smets, E.H. Mamdani, Didier Dubois, & Henri Prade
Non-Standard Logics for Automated Reasoning
(NY: Academic Press, 1988)

Tom's book came out this summer. One might not surmise from the title
that significant parts of the book cover decision-theoretic
approaches.  In particular, chapters 7 and 8 introduce probabilistic
networks, and apply them to planning and control.  More generally, the
book sets out on a comprehensive synthesis of techniques from
artificial intelligence, control theory, operations research and
decision science. A researcher might read it for an understanding of
recent probability networks work in the terms of the more traditional
areas of control, and the somewhat parallel, more conventional AI
approaches to planning.

The "Europeans" book is the result of a pair of (ESPRIT funded?)
workshops in 1986 and 1987.  Each chapter is an exposition of a
different topic in qualitative or quantitative logics. Chapter 8, on
Probabilistic logics is written by Gerhard Paass.  It appears that
this book may serve as a comprehensive tutorial on various attempts at
the expression on uncertainty in reasoning.

Subject: An SPIE session amenable to uncertainty talks.

I have included this clipping from the San Diego SPIE conference
schedule, to point to a new forum for exchange on uncertainty and
recognition approaches. The conference chair, Su-Shing Chen, explained
that he hopes to attract a spectrum of uncertainty approaches to image
recognition. He plans to run a similar session in coming years. He
will be moving to NSF next year.
