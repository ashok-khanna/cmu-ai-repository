*****************************************************************

PURPOSE:
This is the fourth in a series of workshops which has 
brought together  researchers  in  Artificial Intelligence  and in
Statistics to discuss problems of mutual interest.  The result has
been an unqualified success.   The exchange has broadened research
in both fields and has strongly encouraged interdisciplinary work.

This workshop will have as its primary theme:

                  ``Selecting models from data''

Papers on other aspects of the interface between A.I. & Statistics
are *strongly* encouraged as well (see TOPICS below).

FORMAT:
To encourage  interaction and  a  broad  exchange  of  ideas,  the
presentations will be limited to 18  discussion  papers in  single
session  meetings  over the three days.   Focussed poster sessions
will provide the means for presenting and discussing the remaining
research papers.
Attendance at the workshop will *not* be limited.

The three days of research presentations will be preceded by a day
of tutorials.  These are  intended  to expose researchers  in each
field to the methodology used in the other field.

LANGUAGE:
The language will be English.

TOPICS OF INTEREST:

The fourth workshop has a primary theme of

          ``Selecting models from data''.

At least one third of the workshop  schedule will be set aside for 
papers with this theme.     We  particularly encourage papers 
on the following topics:
     - model selection
     - model search
     - model validation
     - integrated man-machine modelling methods
     - software tools and environments for the above.

Other themes will be developed according  to  the  strength of the
papers in other areas of  the interface  between  AI & Statistics.
We strongly encourage research papers on the following areas as
well:

     - empirical discovery and statistical methods for knowledge
       acquisition
     - probability and search
     - uncertainty propagation
     - combined statistical and qualitative reasoning
     - inferring causation
     - quantitative programming tools and integrated software for
       data analysis and modelling.

Subject: Re: Information about the normative systems workshop


                        An Open Letter to the Community of Researchers 
			Interested in Normative Systems 

From: Bruce Abramson, University of Southern California,
      Department of Computer Science and Social Science Research Institute,
      Los Angeles, CA 90089-1111, USA

The second Normative Systems Workshop was held March 29-31 at the
University of Southern California.  About 25-30 people attended, and
about another 25-30 who couldn't make it asked to be kept informed of
the workshop's proceedings.  A lively mixture of research results,
position papers, and discussions were provided by our speakers, Ward
Edwards, Clark Glymour, Raimo Hamalainen, Vladimir Ozernoy, Tod
Levitt, Ross Shachter, Izhar Matzkevich, Sam Holtzman, Peter Regan,
Abder Seridji, Jack Breese, Max Henrion, Marek Druzdzel, Padhraic
Smyth, Eric Johnson, Ron Davison, Dan O'Leary, and me.  This note is
my attempt to share my perceptions of the workshop with everyone who
expressed interest in participating.

Those of you who have been with us since the beginning (late 1990)
know that the workshop originated with a series of discussions among
Ward Edwards, David Heckerman, Eric Horvitz, Jack Breese, and me,
about the growing wave of work that applied decision analytic design
principles to the construction of intelligent systems.  Two key
questions emerged from these discussions: (i) Were we defining a
distinct, new field (or subfield)? and (ii) If so, who constituted the
relevant community (i.e., where is the work presented)?  We were, of
course, aware that much of the best relevant work originating from the
AI and computer science communities is presented at the annual
Uncertainty in AI conference, and that much of the best work from the
DA community is presented at ORSA/TIMS, but we felt that these
conferences were too broad in scope to allow a new community to gel.
The Normative Systems Workshop was devised to help define the field
and to foster the desired sense of community; support from Northrop
(1991), Rockwell International (1991 & 92), and USC's Social Science
Research Institute (1991 & 92) and Department of Computer Science
(1992) helped make the workshop a reality.

Last year's workshop had about 60 attendees, and generated a great
deal of discussion (and debate) about how our nascent field was
circumscribed, what it should be called, and how to best continue our
efforts to form a community.  Since I did the bulk of the organizing
for this year's conference, I reserved the hot seat for myself: I
opened the conference by sharing my view of "Normative Systems."  Much
to my own surprise, very little of what I said proved to be
controversial.  I have thus decided to repeat it here (to a somewhat
broader audience) to see if I can receive the same number of yawns.
If I can, I will have effectively succeeded in defining the field.

The roots of Normative Systems can be traced to five existing fields of
research: Artificial Intelligence, Graph Theory, Decision Theory,
Psychology, and Decision Analysis.  We have adopted certain paradigms
common to each of these fields (or at least to parts of it), but we
have also introduced paradigms not previously studied by researchers in
those field's "mainstreams."

AI is probably the most obvious forerunner of Normative Systems.
After all, we are clearly interested in the design of "intelligent"
systems, or systems that use inexact reasoning to interact with human
decision makers (or other machines) in complex environments.  We have
certainly accepted the AI claim that computer programs need not always
follow well-defined algorithms to "optimal" solutions; normative
systems, like all AI systems, can (and do) err.  Unlike many AI
systems, however, normative systems conform to a norm: rationality, as
defined by decision theory.  Normative advisory systems recommend
decisions that maximize SEU (subjective expected utility), normative
diagnostic systems use Bayes' rule to update their diagnoses in light
of new evidence, normative forecasting systems combine their inputs as
prescribed by the laws of probability theory, etc.  Formal sensitivity
analyses, utility calculations, and value-of-information computations
help guide data collection for all normative systems.

Another debt that we owe to AI lies in our adoption of the viewpoint,
popularized by the expert systems community, that large, carefully
crafted knowledge bases can lead to powerful systems.  We differ from
large parts (although certainly not all) of the AI community, however,
in our general orientation.  We tend to focus on task analyses that
use an understanding of a problem and domain to solve specific
problems rather than on protocol analyses oriented towards capturing
and mimicking the procedures employed by human experts.

Our graph theoretic heritage is almost as obvious.  Graphical
structures, (i.e., influence diagrams and belief networks), often
appear to be the strongest common theme running through our work.
Many of the theoretical foundations of our field rest on graph
theoretic (and network theoretic) algorithms.  We differ from most
graph theorists, however, in that our models capture {\it
information\/} flow.  One of the most important characteristics of our
networks is that Bayes' rule allows information to flow with equal
ease along or against an arc (but not in both directions at the same
time).  This trait is crucial to many of our algorithms and the
operations underlying them (e.g., arc reversal).

Decision theory contributes the primary relationships among domain
objects that we study and capture in our systems: conditional
dependence, and specified as probability distributions.  The domain
objects that we model, in turn, capture chance, decisions, and
values---the basic ingredients of decision theory---and
recommendations (when issued) maximize SEU.  We differ from classical
decision theory, however, in that many of the systems that we build
also include non-decision theoretic constructs, like formulas,
equations, tables, etc.  In short, we tend to study problems that {\it
involve\/} probabilistic inference, rather than simply problems {\it
of\/} probabilistic inference.

Our debt to psychology hinges mostly on the study of elicitation
techniques, which we use to construct our models, and of the cognitive
illusions (or heuristics and biases) and debiasing studies that went
into developing them.  Interfaces to normative systems obviously owe
something to researchers in HCI (human/computer interaction) and
ergonomics.

Decision Analysts have long been doing many of the things that I
described above.  DA is an applications-oriented field that builds
knowledge-intensive models using structured elicitation techniques.
The design of a normative system does this as well, but its potential
for reuse in multiple situations helps enlarge the size of a workable
model and broaden the scope of problems for which structuring is
useful.  Decision analysts model only decision problems; we can
broaden our focus to include diagnoses and forecasts.

Finally, of course, there are a variety of other fields that
contribute applications, study diagnoses, forecasts, modeling, etc.,
and other approaches to uncertainty management and system design.
These fields offer substantial bases for comparison, and provide
benchmarks against which normative systems may be evaluated.

The above discussion summarizes the overview that I proposed for the
nascent (sub)field of Normative Systems (it also, incidentally,
circumscribes the topics that were discussed at the conference).  It
is quite high-level and broad; I am no longer certain whether or not
it is controversial.  This proposed definition is, of course,
tentative, and open to discussion.

I would like to thank those of you who participated in this year's workshop
for helping to make it a success.  I would also like to thank those of you
who responded, but could not attend, for expressing your interest.  I look
forward to next year . . .

Subject: Summaries of the Normative Systems workshop
From: eric@jessica.stanford.edu



The Normative Systems Conference was held March 29-31 on the USC
campus.  It was organized by Bruce Abramson (CS) and Ward Edwards (the
Social Science Research Institute), and supported by Rockwell Palo Alto.
There were roughly 30 participants, and sixteen presentations were offered.
These are summarized below.


		Abbreviated Summary of Presentations to 
		 the 1992 Normative Systems Conference

Bruce Abramson
"Normative Systems" is pragmatic automation of DA/AI, making use of
graph theory for IDs and psychology for probability elicitation and
human/computer interaction.

Ward Edwards
Normative systems' purpose is to deliver more normative advice to more
people.  Our Hailfinder program predicts hail in Colorado better than
other programs by using scenario-based forecasting in an ID.

Clark Glymour
Tetrad II: a PC program to infer causal structures and predict effects
of actions from uncontrolled sample data.

Raimo Hamalainen
Use of "relaxed responses" in multi-person games can stabilize outcomes
where standard "optimal responses" would be unstable.  AI should avail
itself of game theoretic results.

Vladimir Ozernoy
Someone should write an expert system for multi-criterion
decision-making method selection which asks you a few questions,
rank-orders possible MCDM systems, and tells you their pluses and
minuses.

Tod Levitt
Using IDs to represent influence, as well as data and control, in
system specifications allows one to cope with errors of type
identification (not merely attribute measurement) in coupled systems
that reason under uncertainty

Ross Shachter
All known exact methods of probabilistic interence in belief networks
belong to the "clustering" family and are essentially the same.

Izhar Matzkevich
My "topological fusion" algorithm supports prior-compromise consensus of 
multiple experts by creating a composite ID before averaging their
probabilities.

Sam Holtzman (& Peter Regan)
R&D Analyst, a practical normative system, supports evaluation of
individual R&D programs, and optimization of a firm's R&D portfolio by
coaching the user through the DA cycle and supporting systematic
application of company-wide information to projects.

Abder Seridji & Peter Regan
The Advanced Risk Management System (ARMS) Project: a
resource-constrained normative decision system for safety concerns on
offshore drilling platforms.

Jack Breese
AI planning planning tools can help us construct tractable decision
theoretic models dynamically.

Marek Druzdezel (& Max Henrion)
Belief propagation can support better natural-language explanation of
inferences from qualitative probabilistic networks than Wellman's
qualitative reduction.

Padhraic Smyth
Use of a "Hidden Markov Model" filter on a stream of data improves
inferences about the state of the device whose performance is being
measured.

Eric Johnson
An example of computer-generated English-language summary of
sensitivity analysis results from an energy business decision.

Ron Davison
Noting that value tradeoffs can be represented in a way that is
structurally identical to inferential relationships in an ID offers the
possibility of constructing value structures with desirable properties
(additivity, no double-counting).

Dan O'Leary
Accounting for semantic ambiguity of data in expert systems where data
are pre-characterized by human observers is best done by Bayesian
updating based on the probability of getting a certain classification
conditioned on the possible raw data.

Subject: Question: Applications to man made systems

Hallo Uncertainty Researchers,

I am trying to survey the useful (mostly deployed) decision support
systems (or Expert systems) that use Bayes Networks. As far as I can
tell most of the research work on Bayes networks has been, and is
being done in the context of natural systems (e.g. PATHFINDER, MUNIN,
QMR ..). I am interested in finding out about the efforts in
developing expert systems for man made systems, e.g.  a communication
system, a power generation or distribution system etc. My basic
motivation behind this survey is to develop an understanding as to
whether Bayes Networks could be profitably applied to man made
systems. I would appreciate any one or more of following pieces of
information.

1. Reference to a public domain document(s).
2. Brief description about the domain of application, including
	a) Justification of using Bayes Networks
	b) How the Bayes network for the domain was constructed.
	c) Basic features of the bayes network, (Size, Tree, Singly Connected
	   or arbitrary graph)
	d) Any smarts/hacks used to simplify the theory.
	e) Response time requirements.
	f) Success or failure story.

My address is gupta@siemens.com. I thank you for your cooperation and
promise to share the findings.
