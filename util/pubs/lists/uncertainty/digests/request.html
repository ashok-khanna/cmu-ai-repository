                 *Good* uncertainty references wanted.

I'm beginning to realize *good* references are a very valuable commodity.
I'd be grateful if you could send your own suggestions on *good*
references in your own area of probability or uncertainty.
This might include:
	probabilistic interpretations of heuristic method X
	axiomatic foundations of Y
	algorithms for probabilistic problem Z
	probabilistic algorithms for problem W in area A
	application of probabilistic method U
	problems/paradoxes with uncertainty method V
	unifications of methods T_1, T_2, ..., T_n
etc.   With special interest in quality on:
	survey articles
	 (e.g. "Recent Developments in Nonparametric Density Estimation",
		Izenman, JASA, v86, no413, 1991
	discussion articles
	 (e.g. "Statistical Analysis and the Illusion of Objectivity",
		by Berger in the American Scientist, vol 76, March 1988
	text books
	 (e.g. Elements of Information Theory, Cover and Thomas, 1991
	introductory surveys
	 (e.g "Bayesian Networks Without Tears", Charniak, AI Magazine
	      12(4), 1991
	classic conference papers
	 (e.g. "A framework for comparing alternative formalisms for 
		plausible reasoning", Horvitz, Heckerman and Langlotz, AAAI-96
	unification papers
	 (e.g. "The Equivalence of Exact Methods for Probabilistic Inference
                on Belief Networks", Shachter, Andersen and Szolovits, 1991?
	classic references
	 (e.g. "Monte Carlo sampling methods using Markov chains
	       and their applications", Hastings, Biometrika, v57, 1970
So, please, pull out a bag of your favorite papers from your bibliography,
annotate them if you care to, and send them along to me (BibTeX preferred) at
	Wray Buntine      wray@kronos.arc.nasa.gov

If I get reasonable replies I'll collate them and make them available.

[Editor's note: ]

I can't help adding a request: Does anyone have a bibliography, or
references to the work of Myron Tribus? He has done some work in
maximum entropy derivations of probablity theory, and I think recently
some popular explanations of the first principles derivations of
decision theory.  Replies will be compiled and posted (or just send
them to Wray also -j )
