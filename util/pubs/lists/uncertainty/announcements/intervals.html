WORKSHOP ON INTERVAL METHODS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

February 26 through March 1, 1993, Lafayette, Louisiana

   in conjunction with the conference on
 
NUMERICAL ANALYSIS WITH AUTOMATIC RESULT VERIFICATION



General Information
------- -----------

Interval analysis is applicable in scientific computations in which
reliability or automatic verification, or mathematical rigor in
computational results is desirable.

This conference has the following goals.

  *  To provide an accessible forum for researchers in the field to
     exchange the most recent results in interval computations.

  * To further delineate the role of interval computations in
    practical (applied and industrial) problems, and to identify tasks
     which must be completed to facilitate its optimal use in such settings.

  *  To highlight the role of interval mathematics in more purely
     academic pursuits, such as automatic theorem proving.

  *  To stimulate interest and creative research in the field.

Theory, software, computational results, etc. will be presented.

Topics covered include, but are not limited to

  *  Arithmetic
  *  Programming languages and general software tools
  *  Nonlinear systems of equations
  *  Nonlinear optimization
  *  Quadrature
  *  Ordinary differential equations
  *  Partial differential equations
  *  Sensitivity analysis
  *  Linear algebra and linear operators
  *  Industrial and scientific applications

We plan to publish a refereed proceedings.

Conference Location
---------- --------

The conference will be in Lafayette, Louisiana, and will be partially
supported by the University of Southwestern Louisiana.

Lafayette, a town of approximately 100,000 with no heavy industry, is
the site of the University of Southwestern Louisiana, the second
largest public university in Louisiana, serving 16,000 students.  The
surrounding region a rich subtropical agricultural delta of the
Mississippi River and home of the Cajuns, a French-speaking
population, descendants of the uprooted Acadians of Canada.

The conference begins two days after Mardi Gras. traditional (Cajun)
Mardi Gras celebrations from the seventeenth century take place near
Lafayette during this time.  Also, weeks of elaborate Mardi Gras
(carnival) celebrations occur in New Orleans, which is 2.5 hours by
car from Lafayette.

Outdoor activities include boating and fishing, with nearby state
parks, botanical gardens, and the Atchafalaya swamp.  There should be
floral blooms during the conference.  There are two operating replicas
of traditional Cajun villages near Lafayette.

The average high temperature in late February is around 68 degrees
Fahrenheit and the average low is around 45 degrees Fahrenheit, but
with substantial variation.


Social Events
------ ------

Friday afternoon, conference participants will sample Cajun food,
dancing, and history at Vermilionville, a living museum.  Saturday
evening, there will be a crawfish boil with a Cajun band.  These
events are included in the registration fee.

Additional activities, such as boat tours of the Atchafalaya swamp,
visits to botanical gardens, and visits to renowned local restaurants,
may also be arranged.  Participants also have the option of arriving
early to take part in Mardi Gras festivities.  These occur both around
Lafayette and in New Orleans on and before February 23 (two days
before the conference).
