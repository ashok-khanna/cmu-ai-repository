ECTL Archive
=============

The ECTL archive is located at snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca [131.104.48.1] in the
directory pub/ectl. There you will find all but the earliest of issues of ECTL.
Issues are simply labelled by their issue number (ex. 2.08.02) The first 
number, the volume number, refers to the year (2.xx.xx -> 1992), the second 
number is the sub-volume number which refers to the month, finally the third
number refers to the issue number for that year and month. Files are organized
into separate directories according to the volume number. All files, except
this one, are compressed (note the ".Z" suffix) using the standard unix
compress algorithm. Simply use: uncompress <filename> to get them back to
readable form. 

You might notice that there is a list of ECTL subscribers in the
archive, for general interest. (Please note that phone numbers and e-mail
addresses are not given, and any requests for that information will be denied.

To appear soon in the archive are an index of speech related technical
reports, and a list of commercial speech products. To add to either of these
sections of the archive, submit to ectl-sub@snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca
with the subject commercial advert or publication index.


A Bit About ECTL
================

ECTL was formed to offer a forum in which researchers interested in computer
interfaces could post queries, debate issues and post notices.  Backgrounds
include DSP, AI, HCI, Linguistics and others.  It was thought that the broad
focus would benefit everyone (at least some of the time) since we all can have
something new to learn.

At present the list has about 600 subscribers from about 32 different
countries. It is hoped that this group will grow and be active. So, please pass
the word and enjoy.
