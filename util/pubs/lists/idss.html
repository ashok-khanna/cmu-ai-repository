                         IDSS MAILING LIST

The IDSS Mailing list aims to act as a forum to exchange ideas on the 
design, implementation and maintenance of Intelligent Decision Support 
Systems (IDSSs).  The list is a free service which is offered by the 
IDSSs laboratory in the School of Computing Sciences at the University 
of Technology, Sydney (UTS).

IDSSs have proven to be successful at supporting complex decision making 
problems at all levels of an organisation.  Although there has been a 
large amount of research work in building IDSSs, there has been few 
conferences, workshops, discussion groups and interest groups established 
for IDSSs.  We hope that this mailing list will serve as a discussion 
group for IDSSs, which can be used as a media for sharing ideas and for 
the creation of conferences and workshops.
