Subject: Announcement: Looking for a new moderator

I have been unable to work on NL-KR for the past two months, and I'm
trying now to get some issues out and deal with the administrative
backlog.  I don't forsee myself being able to devote even the hour or
two a week this Digest requires anytime in the near future, so I'd
like to put out the call for a new moderator.  If you are interested,
let me know - send mail to weltyc@cs.rpi.edu not nl-kr.

I apologize for the two month hiatus.  I am simply removing all CFPs
and other announcements whose expirations have past in order to get
out as much as possible.

If you sent me an administrative request, it may take some time.  I
apologize to those who requested removal from the Digest, you will
probably get a few more issues before I get to your request, as I want
to get the CFPs and Announcements whose deadlines are approaching out
as fast as I can.

Newsgroups: comp.ai.nlang-know-rep
Subject: Announcemet: New newsgroup comp.ai.nat-lang
Followup-To: news.groups

This is an official request for discussion (RFD) for the formation of
the newsgroup, comp.ai.nat-lang

             Charter for comp.ai.nat-lang

Name:         comp.ai.nat-lang

Moderation:   This group will be unmoderated.

Purpose:      To discuss issues relating to natural language, especially
              computer-related issues from an AI viewpoint.   The topics
              that will be discussed in this group will concentrate on, but
              are not limited to, the following:

                   *   Natural Language Understanding
                   *   Natural Language Generation
                   *   Machine Translation
                   *   Dialogue and Discourse Systems
                   *   Natural Language Interfaces
                   *   Parsing
                   *   Computational Linguistics
                   *   Computer-Aided Language Learning

              This group will avoid discussing issues that are more properly
              covered by other newsgroups.   For example, speech synthesis
              should be discussed in comp.speech.   However, due to the
              interdisciplinary nature of the field, there may be overlap in
              material between other groups.    To try to keep this to a 
              minimum, topics should pertain to computer-related aspects
              of natural language.

Rules of Decorum:  Because of the unmoderated format, anyone with access to
                   this newsgroup will be able to post without review.
                   This is meant to encourage discussion of the topics.
                   Please refrain from "flames" or unnecessary criticism
                   of a person's viewpoints or personality in a harsh
                   or insulting manner.   Criticisms should constructive
                   and polite whenever possible.

Intended Audience:  While there can be some talk of linguistics, we
                    are going to only cover topics that pertain
                    to natural language processing, and not all
                    of linguistics, and therefore, in some ways
                    we are narrower and broader in the range of
                    topics that we will talk about compared to sci.lang.
                    Therefore, we do not wish to restrict this newsgroup
                    to linguists only.   

                    We should restrict discussion of speech synthesis
                    and recognition to groups like comp.speech, except where
                    they serve as parts of a bigger natural language system.
               
                    Also, while this group is meant for those people in the 
                    field, we should be open to those who are interested
                    in natural language processing, but who may not have
                    had much expertise in the field.   These may include
                    beginners in the field as well as those who might
                    simply find the area interesting, even though they
                    work in a different area.
End of charter

Discussion period:   The last day for discussion will be set for Sunday, 
                     February 28, 1992 (or 28 February 1992 for Europeans).
                     If there is still ongoing discussion that appears
                     serious, we will continue discussion via e-mail.

Name of the group:   As pointed out in another post, the original leading
                     choice for the name of the newsgroup was comp.ai.nlp.
                     Originally, I would have let this name be the name
                     of the group.   However, the moderator of news.announce.newgroups
                     and his colleagues suggest that "nlp", unlike "AI" is a 
                     bit too cryptic, and that their experience is that cryptic
                     names are not good because they lead to people who
                     add spurious posts to the newsgroup.   Rather than
                     reopen up the selection to a vote, I have, for reasons
                     of creating this newsgroup, selected the name which
                     someone had suggested to me, and one that I liked,
                     comp.ai.nat-lang.

                     I am sympathetic to those who had wanted the group
                     to be called comp.ai.nlp, since "nlp" is commonly used,
                     but rather than get into potential trouble by using
                     this name, and under the belief that the newsgroup
                     should be formed rather than get too worried about
                     the choice of name, I decided to change the name to 
                     one that was more descriptive to people who aren't
                     in the field (and some of those are in AI!).

Call For Votes:      Short of a flurry of people sending me mail to the
                     contrary, my intention is to start the call for votes
                     (CFV) on Tuesday, March 2, 1992, and end in on
                     Monday, March 30, 1992 at midnight Eastern Time.
                     Instructions for voting should be posted by 
                     Monday 1, 1992.  

Reminders:  This is the final Request For Discussion, and the period
            of discussion will end this Sunday.   Due to the moderately
            low posting (except concerning the name), there appears
            to be little opposition to forming the group, and hopefully
            we can keep it that way.

E-mail:    Any questions or suggestions can be e-mailed to me, Charles Lin,
           at clin@eng.umd.edu.   If there are any problems e-mailing me, let
           me know via posting, or asking another person to forward mail
           to me (this might be preferable).

Followup discussion:   All followup discussion will be carried out on
                       news.groups.   You may wish to crosspost to other
                       groups, but to keep clutter in other groups to
                       a minimum, discussion is preferably confined to
                       news.groups.

                    Call for Participation
                    ----------------------
                     AAAI-93 Workshop on
                   Reasoning About Function
                   ========================
                   Washington D.C., July '93

Description of Workshop: 
- ----------------------

The explicit representation and use of the function (purpose) of an object,
either as intended by its designer or as interpreted by its user, is
emerging as a focal point of problem solving in fields as diverse as
Device Invention, Redesign, Diagnosis, Explanation Generation and
Automatic Debugging.  Explicit treatment of function has proven to be
very useful because of its potential to organize and provide access to
causal knowledge of the object (eg., focuses on missing causality
during redesign), because of the improved resolution it brings
to the reasoning process (eg., discriminates among suspects
during diagnosis) and because of its utility in addressing the scaling
problem. To date, function-based knowledge has been successfully
applied in several domains, including Software Engineering, Human
Physiology, and various fields of engineering such as Electrical,
Aerospace and Chemical Engineering.
 
The objectives of this workshop are: 1) to examine current techniques
used to represent and reason about function; 2) to present a forum to
develop a shared framework for reasoning about function, and 3) to
identify the trends and future directions for this emerging field.

Topics
- -----

The workshop will focus on the following issues:

1) Terminology: theoretical analyses yielding an appropriate
vocabulary for function; disambiguating function from other terms such
as behavior and teleology: what are the interactions and dependencies
between them? How do form, use, experience, etc. relate to function?

2) Representation: What are the issues in acquisition of function
knowledge? What are the ontological bases of an adequate function
representation: processes, states, flows, parameters? How can
representational primitives be chosen in a given ontology? What impact
does the intended use of a function model have on its construction?
How is knowledge of function related to behavioral, structural and
heuristic knowledge?

3) Reasoning: What are the sorts of tasks/domains for which Functional
Reasoning is particularly well suited?  What are the AI processes
involved in exploiting function knowledge during reasoning? How can
reasoning about function, behavior, teleology, etc. be integrated into
a coherent system?

4) Applications: An examination of implemented systems, i.e.,
representation and reasoning techniques used, evaluation of the system
and lessons learned from the experience.

Format of Workshop:
- ---------------------

The workshop will address the work of participants in the form of
moderated presentations and discussions. Where appropriate,
participants will be invited to display posters describing their work.
Separate sessions will be devoted to terminology, representation
issues, reasoning and application issues. The workshop will conclude
with a summarizing panel discussion.

Attendance: 
- ----------

Participation is by invitation only, and will be limited to
approximately 35 people. See Submission Requirements below for the
criteria to be invited.

Submission Requirements: 
- ------------------------

Those who wish to attend the workshop should submit four copies of a
1-2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications,
regular and email address (where possible) and phone and FAX number.
Those who wish to present their work at the workshop should submit
four copies of a short paper (6-8 pages) in addition to the research
summary. If the work has been published or submitted for consideration
elsewhere, please specify the journal or conference.  Note that,
unpublished work is preferred for presentation. Electronic submissions
will not be accepted. All submissions will be reviewed by the Workshop
Committee.

In order to facilitate interaction among participants, you are
requested to specify the following with regard to your work: topic
(terminology/representation/reasoning/application), field
(redesign/diagnosis/explanation generation etc.) and domain
(electrical/chemical/physiology etc.). In submitted papers, you are
urged to either define or relate to existing literature, all
terminology used.  Also, please include a two-line description of the
main contribution of your paper.

Submission Deadline: March 12, 1993

Subject: CFP: Seventh International Workshop on Unification (UNIF93)

                             UNIF93

	     Seventh International Workshop on Unification	
           Preliminary Annoucement and Call for Participation

		 Sunday, June 13 -- Monday, June 14
	         Boston University, Boston MA (USA) 

This workshop is the seventh in a series of meetings on unification and 
related topics, the previous ones having been in Val d'Ajol (France), 
Lambrecht (Germany), Leeds (UK), Barbizon (France), and Dagstuhl (Germany).
As its predecessors, UNIF93 is meant to be an opportunity to meet
old and new colleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work, 
and to discuss new ideas and trends in unification and related fields. 
It is also a good opportunity for young researchers and researchers 
working in related areas to get an overview of the current state of
the art in unification theory. 

The following is a (non-exclusive) list of possible topics:

	* Narrowing				* Typed Unification
	* General E-unification and Calculi	* Foundations
	* Implementations			* Applications
	* Unification in Special Theories	* Combination problems
	* Constraint Solving			* Disunification
        * Higher-Order Unification              * Type reconstruction
        * Unification-Based approaches to       * Matching
              Grammar                 

This year's workshop will be jointly organized by Franz Baader 
and Wayne Snyder. It is scheduled to make it convenient for those 
traveling to RTA and LICS in Montreal to attend (RTA starts on 
wednesday, June 16, and LICS on June 20). 

The workshop will take place in the Computer Science Department at
Boston University, located in the center of Boston on the Charles River,
with easy access via subway (or by foot) to MIT, Harvard,
Northeastern, Harvard Square, the Public Garden and Boston Commons,
the harbor area, the Backbay area, and a wide variety of cultural
events and historical sights. 

Lodging has been obtained for workshop participants
in air-conditioned dormitories at Boston University for saturday 
through monday nights, but may also be arranged in local hotels or 
"bed and breakfasts." With the help of an small NSF grant for the
workshop, the cost has been kept relatively low, approximately
$135 total, which includes a single-occupancy room for three nights with 
breakfast, a banquet on monday night, and the workshop itself. 
(Double--occupancy rooms will be slightly less expensive.)
Lunch on both days and dinner on sunday night will be up to
the individuals (there are many restaurants and shops in the area,
as well as a faculty club with a good view of the Charles River).
Those staying in hotels should expect to pay approximately $75 to $90
for each night, and about $50 for the workshop. 

The format of the workshop will depend on the number of participants,
but it is likely to consist of talks of approximately half hour
in length, with time for discussion and interaction. 
We are also considering having one or more hour long survey talks.
Final arrangements will depend on the number of participants
and their interests. Those wishing to give system demonstrations
can avail themselves of our department computer network.

If you intend to participate in the workshop, please apply as soon as
possible (preferably by E-mail before the end of February) to

           **** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ****

IJCAI Workshop ``Object-Based Representation Systems''

             Chambery (August 28th 1993)
- -----------------------------------------------------

The goal of the workshop is to study the notion of ``object'' as a
knowledge grain in knowledge-based systems.
A first category of object-based representation systems mainly
includes terminological (or description) logics.
People working in this area are more interested in studying and using
declarative representations.
A second category includes hybrid systems that rely on frame-based
languages and object-oriented programming.
People working in this area are more interested by the representation
and the use of procedural components.
Thus, the topics of interest of the workshop are the following:
- objects in knowledge representation: concepts, frames, classes.
- links between description logics and hybrid systems (frame-based or
class-based systems).
- fundamental relationships: specialization/generalization,
subsumption, part-whole, other partial orderings and equivalence
relations.
- objects, constraints and other relations: temporal and spatial
relations, general constraints (equalities, inequalities).
- representation of procedural knowledge: reflexes (demons), methods.
- reasoning with objects: inheritance, classification-based reasoning,
truth maintenance.

The workshop is intended to be a challenge to understand the
contributions of the more logical and more procedural approaches.
Participants will try to develop guidelines for interpreting the
usefulness of each approach.
They will also be encouraged to exchange different points of
view, and possibly, to define a more complete and universal
object-based representation formalism integrating the two approaches.

- -----------------------------
Participation and Organization
- -----------------------------

Participation will be of two kinds: speaker and regular participant.
People interested in attending the workshop must send a position

       NINTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

                      July 9-11, 1993, Washington D.C.

                               CALL FOR PAPERS

The ninth annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence will be
devoted to methods for reasoning under uncertainty as applied to problems in
artificial intelligence.  The conference's scope covers the full range of
approaches to automated and interactive reasoning and decision making under
uncertainty, including both qualitative and numeric methods.  

We seek papers on fundamental theoretical issues, on computational techniques
for uncertain reasoning, and on the foundations of alternative paradigms of
uncertain reasoning.  Topics of interest include:

 -  Foundations of uncertainty concepts 
 -  Representations of uncertain knowledge and their semantics
 -  Knowledge acquisition
 -  Construction of uncertainty models from data
 -  Uncertainty in machine learning
 -  Automated planning and decision making under uncertainty
 -  Algorithms for uncertain inference
 -  Pooling of uncertain evidence
 -  Belief updating and inconsistency handling in uncertain knowledge bases 
 -  Explanation and summarization of uncertain information
 -  Control of reasoning and real-time architectures

This year, we hope to attract more contributions that emphasize real-world
applications of uncertain reasoning.  Questions of particular interest
include:

- Why was it necessary to represent uncertainty in your domain?
- What kind of uncertainties does your application address?
- Why did you decide to use your particular uncertainty formalism?
- What theoretical problems, if any, did you encounter?
- What practical problems did you encounter?
- Did users of your system find the results or recommendations useful?
- Did the introduction of your system lead to improvements in reasoning
    or decision making?
- What methods were used to validate the effectiveness of the systems?

Papers will be carefully refereed for originality, significance, technical
soundness, and clarity of exposition.  Papers may be accepted for presentation
in plenary or poster sessions.  Some key applications oriented work may be
presented both in a plenary session and in a poster session where more
technical details can be discussed.  All accepted papers will be included in
the published proceedings.  Outstanding student papers may be selected for
special distinction.

Five copies of each paper should be sent to one of the Program Co-Chairs by
February 5, 1993.  The first page should include a descriptive title, the
names, addresses, and student status of all authors, a brief abstract, and
salient keywords or other topic indicators.  Acceptance notices will be sent
by March 29, 1993.  Final camera-ready papers, incorporating reviewers'
suggestions, will be due approximately five weeks later.  There will be an
eight-page limit on proceedings papers, with a few extra pages available for
a fee.

             10th International Conference on Logic Programming     
                         Post-conference Workshop on

                             ABDUCTIVE REASONING 
                             -------------------

                              Budapest, Hungary
                              June 24 - 25, 1993

Abduction was introduced by the logician and philosopher C. S. Pierce at
the beginning of the century as a new inference mechanism for logical
systems along with deduction and induction. 
It has been investigated in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming
since the early 80's, and it has shown itself to be a basic concept for
formalizing various  aspects of hypothetical reasoning.
Recently, it has been used as a fundamental tool for a better understanding
of the relations between hypothetical, nonmonotonic and default reasoning.
Abduction is also directly relevant to various aspects of LP. These include
the semantics of LP (particularly of negation as failure), extensions of
LP, e.g. Constraint Logic Programming, and several applications of LP. A wide 
range of A.I. applications such as diagnosis, planning and knowledge 
assimilation have been investigated, often within the LP framework, using
abduction.
The workshop is intended to bring together researchers interested in all 
aspects of abductive reasoning and abductive logic programming, with the
aim to be a forum for exchange and integration of ideas on this subject.
Topics of the workshop include,  but are not limited to :

 - theory and semantics
 - computational aspects of abduction
 - relations to default and nonmonotonic reasoning
 - relations to Constraint Logic Programming
 - applications to planning and diagnostic reasoning
 - applications to natural language
 - relations with other areas of AI, LP, databases and knowledge bases
 - philosophical foundations

Authors interested in presenting their work are invited to send a 3-5 pages
extended abstract before April 15th at the address below. Electronic
submissions in latex or postscript format are strongly encouraged. Surface
mail submissions must include four copies of the paper. Authors will be
notified of acceptance/rejection of their submissions by May 15th. The
final version is due by the end of May.

          Program Committee
          =================

          The international program committee will consist of
          approximately 40 members from all main fields of AI and
          from Cognitive Science.

          We invite researchers from the various areas of Artificial
          Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Pattern Recognition,
          including Vision, Learning, Knowledge Representation and
          Foundations, to submit articles which assess or review the
          progress made so far in their respective areas, as well as
          the relevance of that progress to the whole enterprise of
          AI. Other papers which do not address the theme are also
          invited.

          Feature
          =======

          Four 70 minute invited talks and five panel discussions are
          devoted to the chosen topic: "Are we moving ahead: Lessons
          from Computer Vision." The speakers include (in
          alphabetical order)

                   * Lev  Goldfarb
                   * Stephen  Grossberg
                   * Robert  Haralick
                   * Tomaso  Poggio

          Such a concentrated analysis of the area will be undertaken
          for the first time.  We feel that the "Lessons from Computer
          Vision" are of relevance to the entire AI community.

RESEARCH POSITION IN COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

Canon Research Centre Europe Ltd
Guildford, UK

Canon Research Centre Europe is looking for new recruits for its
Natural Language Processing research group.

We are looking for people who will fit well into the NLP group on a
permanent basis, rather than for specific projects. The following areas
of expertise are the most important.

	- natural language processing
	- knowledge representation and reasoning
	- large-scale corpus analysis
	
A good general computer science or linguistics background is important,
as are excellent programming skills, including fluency in Prolog.
Creativity and a flair for innovative work are essential.

Our principal interest is in interpretation relative to context, and in
using pragmatics and generalised non-linguistic reasoning to enhance
Natural Language systems. This research work is not currently tied to
the production of a particular product, but seen rather as providing a
foundation for more directed application work at the right point in the
future. Producing a prototype is, however, of prime importance.

We are also engaged in producing software to aid the translation of
Canon documentation. The first version of this software has already
been delivered and activity on this project is expected to increase.
Experience with handling very large corpora would be an advantage in
this area. People with expertise in speech processing might also find
their skills put to good use.

Canon Research Centre Europe has been on the University of Surrey
Research Park since 1988. We doubt that you would be disappointed by
salary, equipment or working environment. Our recruitment policy is one
of equal opportunity.

Please note that you need to have the right to work in Britain in order
to apply for this position. If you are not a citizen of one of the
member states of the European Community, please check whether you are
eligible before applying.

If you are interested, please send a detailed CV to:

	Shirley Alexander-O'Neill

	Surrey Research Park
	Guildford GU2 5YD, UK

	tel:	+44-483-574325
	fax:	+44-483-574360

You can send a paper copy, or email a copy to nljob@canon.co.uk in
plain text (preferred), LaTeX, Framemaker, troff, etc. Please send in
your application by 15 February 1993. Late applications will be
considered at our discretion. Please send only cvs/applications to
nljob@canon.co.uk. If you need more information, please get in touch
with Tom Wachtel (wachtel@canon.co.uk) or with Shirley
Alexander-O'Neill (personnel@canon.co.uk).

Within the framework of the EUROLANG project (100 Million ECU),
jointly managed by SITE, the European leader in multilingual,
multimedia technical documentation, and SIEMENS NIXDORF, one of
the major European corporations in the field of computer
technology, we are now in a second phase of recruitment of :

- Computational linguists with practical experience in writing
  computational grammars (for English, German and French).

- Computational linguists with practical experience in the
  following fields:
  . Machine translation
  . Parsers / Generators
  . Corpus analysis / Sublanguage methodologies / Terminology
  . Statistics-based NL processing

- Computational lexicographers with practical experience of
  writing bi-lingual computational dictionaries for natural language
  processing purposes (for English, German and French).

Successful candidates will be based in Paris, France, at the R&D
offices of SITE. Several posts are available. Salaries shall be
commensurate with experience.

Applicants should have a good first degree and post-graduate
qualifications (or appropriate experience) in relevant fields, and
should preferably have good experience of relevant project work in
industry or academia. Experience of multilingual natural language 
processing would be a distinct advantage.

Eurolang is a EUREKA project involving a large European consortium

the project is on the development of a commercial machine
translation system, appropriate support tools and large-scale 
linguistic resources, using state-of-the-art technology. Thus, 
preference will be given to candidates offering practical experience 
in the field and a commitment to working in an industrial R&D 
environment.

Letters of application, including 2 copies of a Curriculum Vitae
and the names of two referees, should be sent to:

                               Simon Sabbagh
                               SITE

Subject: Position: NLP guest researcher at SICS (Sweden)
Date: Mon, 22 Feb 1993 15:34:57 GMT

We offer the opportunity of visiting the Swedish Institute of 
Computer Science (SICS) as a guest researcher for a period of 
time ranging from a month to a year, according to the guest
researcher's own preferences. SICS is located north of Stockholm,
Sweden.

The visiting researcher will be working with the Natural Language 
Processing group, which currently consists of four persons: Ivan 
Bretan, Bj|rn Gamb{ck, Jussi Karlgren and Christer Samuelsson.

The main focus of the group is developing a Swedish Natural 
Language system based on the SRI Core Language Engine (CLE) 
and using this as a vehicle for other NL research activities.
The group has gained recognition in the fields of machine 
translation and applying machine learning techniques to NLP.

Current activities include developing advanced prototypes for
Swedish industrial companies in the fields of automatic spoken 
language translation, support systems for human translation, and
information retrieval mixing NLP and statistical methods.

The basic research focuses on improving the Swedish NL system;
on developing self-organizing language models, using both
statistical methods and machine learning techniques; and on 
applied research in the field of multi-modal (NL-graphical) 
interfaces.

A variety of projects can be conceived depending on the visitor's
length of stay and his or her special competence and preferences.
One scenario is the visitor taking part in one or several of the 
activities mentioned above. Another is for example extending the 
system to cover a foreign language (German, French, Japanese ...).

A visiting researcher should be interested in and have competence
in several of the following areas:

- - self-organizing language models
- - machine translation
- - grammar development
- - multi-modal interfaces
- - robust text processing (skimming, part-of-speech identification)

The main programming languages of the group are (SICStus) Prolog and C.

Subject: Announcement: ALE:  An Attribute Logic Engine

ALE:  An Attribute Logic Engine
- ------------------------------

ALE, a public domain system written in Prolog, integrates phrase
structure parsing and constraint logic programming with typed feature
structures as terms.  This generalizes both the feature structures of
PATR-II and the terms of Prolog II to allow type inheritance and
appropriateness specifications for features and values.  Grammars may
also interleave unification steps with logic program goal calls (as
can be done in DCGs), thus allowing parsing to be interleaved with
other system components.  While ALE was developed to handle HPSG
grammars, it can also execute PATR-II grammars, DCG grammars, Prolog,
Prolog-II, and LOGIN programs, etc.

Grammars and logic programs are specified using a typed version of
Rounds-Kasper attribute-value logic, which includes variables and full
disjunction.  Programs are then compiled into low-level Prolog
instructions corresponding to the basic operations of the typed
Rounds-Kapser logic.  There is a strong type discipline enforced on
descriptions, allowing many errors to be detected at compile-time.

The logic programming and parsing systems may be used independently or
together.  Features of the logic programming system include negation,
disjunction and cuts.  It has last call optimization, but does not
perform any argument indexing.  On the 'naive reverse' benchmark, it
performed at 1000 LI/s on a DEC 5100 running SICStus 2.1, which is
rouglhy 15% as fast as the SICStus interpreter and 1.5% as fast as the
SICStus compiler.

The phrase structure system employs a bottom-up all-paths chart
parser.  A general lexical rule component is provided, including
procedural attachment and general methods for orthographic
transformations using pattern matching or Prolog.  Empty categories
are permitted in the grammar.  Both the phrase structure and logic
programming components of the system allow parametric macros to be
defined and freely employed in descriptions.  Parser performance is
similar to that of the logic programming system.  In an early HPSG
grammar, where feature structures consisted of roughly 100-200 nodes
each, a 10 word sentence producing 25 completed inactive edges parsed
in roughly two seconds, using SICStus 2.1 on a DEC 5100.

Complete documentation (running to 80 pages, with examples of everything,
programming advice, and sample grammars), is available as:

    Bob Carpenter (1992) ALE User's Guide.  Carnegie Mellon University
         Laboratory for Computational Linguistics Technical Report.
         Pittsburgh.

ALE can be run in either SICStus or Quintus Prolog, and with other
compatible compilers doing first-argument indexing and last-call
optimization.  The system and its documentation are available without
charge for research purposes from the address below.  Please indicate
whether electronic copies of program and documentation can be sent via
e-mail and whether they should be compressed or not:

Subject: Announcement: Summer Internships at ICSI
Date: Tue, 5 Jan 1993 18:36:34 GMT

The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is soliciting
applications for their student summer internship program in Europe.
The program is open to advanced graduate students in computer
science at American universities.

Applicants don't need to be U.S. citizens OR
permanent residents of the U.S. to be eligible for the
program. The selection process is soley based on merit
and works roughly as follows: an application is submited
to ICSI where an initial selection takes place.
ICSI does not have special application forms for the summer
internship program. A cover letter stating the applicants intentions,
transcripts, and one or two letters of recommendation is sufficient.
It would also be very helpful if the applicant could provide a short 
proposal stating what he/she is interested in and the particular
fields he/she would want to work in.
The selected applications will be forwarded to those
participating research labs that best match
the applicants scientific interest and background.
Depending on the applicants interest, background, and
research proposal her/his application might be
send to several of the research labs. It is the 
research labs that make the final decision.

Current sponsor nations are Germany, Italy and Switzerland. 
ICSI is *not* able to support or process applications for internships
in non-sponsor nations.

Graduate students which have been invited by research labs in
ICSI sponsor nations due to their own initiative or
existing collaborations can apply for travel grants. However, ICSI
will not be able to provide financial support beyond travel grants.

Financial support provided by the hosting research lab is
approximately $1800 per month for 3 month while ICSI provides
travel grants up to $1500.

Submit applications including at least one letter of recommendation,
a list of completed course work, and a statement of intent to:

	 International Computer Science Institute
	 -Summer Internship Program
	 1947 Center Street, Suite 600
	 Berkley, CA 94704

	 ******************************
	 *                            *
	 *  DEADLINE  March 1, 1993   *
	 *                            *
	 ******************************

Note: ICSI is only a clearinghouse for summer internship
applications. ICSI is not able to answer question concerning
specific research activities within participating research labs.
In the past summer interns have been working in such areas as
computer vision, expert systems, knowledge representation, natural
language processing, software engineering, software tool development,
etc..

Subject: Announcement: Alvey NL Tools Release 4

THE ALVEY NATURAL LANGUAGE TOOLS (RELEASE 4)
BASIC DESCRIPTION AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS

A fourth (and final) release of the Alvey Natural Language Tools
(ANLT) is now available. The UK Alvey Programme originally funded
three projects at the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh and
Lancaster to provide tools for use in natural language processing
research. The DTI and SERC has funded their continued support and
enhancement. The tools, a MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSER, PARSERS and a
GRAMMAR and LEXICON, are usable individually as well as together
(integrated by a GRAMMAR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT) forming a complete
system for the morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of a
considerable subset of English.

DISTRIBUTION AND LICENSING

The ANLT system is available by anonymous FTP from Cambridge
University, Computer Laboratory. The files containing grammars,
lexicons and source code are encrypted, however, reports describing
the system, specimen licence agreement and other information is not.
If after examining the documentation, you wish to purchase a licence
for use of the system for research purposes, you should complete and
sign the specimen agreement and return it together with a cheque for
the amount specified in the agreement (currently 500 ECU -- 100 ECU
upgrade -- or local currency equivalent) to:

Lynxvale WCIU Programs
20 Trumpington St.
Cambridge, CB2 1QA, UK
Fax: +223 332797

On receipt Lynxvale will send you (by letter) the key which can be
used in conjunction with the software provided to decrypt the
remaining files. If you do not have access to anonymous FTP, you can
write to Lynxvale for further details and obtain the system on
magnetic tape or cartridge. We are currently negotiating with Longman
Group UK Ltd, who have an interest in the large lexicon, to provide a
commercial licence for use of the ANLT system. A specimen commercial
licence agreement will be deposited in the files shortly.

DESCRIPTION

The MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSER provides a set of mechanisms for the
analysis of complex word forms. The analyser requires data files
specifying a lexicon of base morphemes, rules governing spelling
changes when concatenating morphemes, and rules describing valid
combinations of morphemes in complex words. The tools include a
description of English morphology in this form. The analyser should be
capable, though, when provided with the necessary linguistic analyses,
of being used for most European languages and many others. The
morphological analyser is now available independently of the rest of
the tools package by anonymous FTP from scott.cogsci.ed.ac.uk
[129.215.144.3]:/pub/phonology/tools/MAP/MAP3.1.tar.Z Further
enquiries may be sent to Alan W Black (awb@ed.ac.uk).

There are two alternative PARSERS. The main one is an optimized chart
parser, incorporating a 'packing' mechanism (making it much more
efficient when parsing sentences containing multiple local
ambiguities).  The other parser is a non-deterministic LALR(1) parser
which seems, in most cases, to be even more efficient than the chart
parser.

The GRAMMAR is a wide-coverage syntactic and semantic grammar of
English, written in a metagrammatical formalism derived from
Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar. The grammar pairs one or more
formulas of the lambda calculus with each syntactic rule and these
produce unscoped (mostly) first-order `event-based' compositional
semantic representations. Full coverage is provided of the following
constructions and their combinations:

   - all sentence types: declaratives, imperatives and questions (yes/no,
   tag and wh questions),
   - all unbounded dependency types: topicalisation, relativisation, wh 
   questions,
   - a relatively exhaustive treatment of verb and adjective complement
   types,
   - phrasal and prepositional verbs of many complement types,
   - passivisation, verb phrase extraposition,
   - sentence and verb phrase modification,
   - noun phrase complements,
   - noun phrase pre- and post-modification,
   - partitives,
   - coordination of all major category types,
   - nominal and adjectival comparatives.

The LEXICON contains 40,000 homonyms (63,000 entries in total) in the
form required by the morphological analyser.

The GRAMMAR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT gives access to all of the other
components of the tools, allowing grammars to be input, edited, and
browsed; it also compiles them into the base grammatical formalism
used by the parsers, and provides extensive grammar debugging
facilities.  A simple quantifier scoping and post-processing module is
supplied as an example of how the result of parsing a sentence can be
converted into a representation suitable for further semantic and
pragmatic processing. In addition, an illustrative database management
application with a small database of wine merchants' stock is
supplied. 

All of the software components are written in Common Lisp and have
been tested in several implementations on a wide range of machines.

We have created a BULLETIN BOARD which we hope can be used to inform
existing users about developments, to provide some informal support,
and as a forum for discussion between people doing research with the
ANLT system. Submissions should be sent to alveynltools@cl.cam.ac.uk
and requests to be added to or deleted from the distribution list
should be sent to alveynltools-request@cl.cam.ac.uk. If you are an
existing user and this message has come to you direct, your email
address has been added to the list already; unfortunately though, we
do not have up-to-date email addresses for all known users, so please
email alveynltools-request otherwise.

    The conference is run by the Ph.D. Program in Applied Linguistics.
However, University reductions in linguistics faculty and resources 
have placed the graduate (as well as the undergraduate) linguistics 
program in jeopardy.

    We would welcome letters of support for our Ph.D. Program in
Applied Linguistics and for the annual Boston University Conference 
on Language Development, sent to:
  
   Carol Neidle, Director                   carol@louis-xiv.bu.edu

We will then forward them to the Provost at the appropriate time.
Please contact me directly if you would like any additional 
information.

   We hope that the University will restore these essential resources
to the linguistics program, and that we will be able to hold the
conference in 1994.

   Thank you.

I've almost completed a paper on Linguistics that I'd like to submit
to the Journal of Computational Linguistics.  I'd like to send it to
anyone interested and ask for comments, and suggestions. There is
a lot of interesting stuff here :-)...

	LINGUISTIC METRIC SPACES

Section I: OPPOSITIONS, RELATIONS, GROUPS, LATTICES
	Binary oppositions of Jakobson, Binary Relations, Groups
	Isomorphisms, Partial Ordering, Lattices
	All applied to structure of Consonant sets and vowels, 
	Ordinal vowels, relation to cardinal vowels, Ladefoged Modification. etc

SEc II: PRIVATE AND UNIVERSAL VOWEL SPACES
 	More on Isomorphism, Rings, Lattices, Hilbert Curves,
	Linear Ordering, Private Vowel Spaces, Bloch and Trager
	Spaces, Chomsky & Halle Spaces, Hamming Distance, Complements,
	Pure Vowels, Compound Vowels,Dipthongs, Trubetzkoy quantal vowels, 
	Articulatory dimensions and operations and relation to the
	semigroup and lattice structures.

Sec III: UNIVERSAL DISCRETE SPACES, CODES..
	Discrete Universal Spaces, Algorithm for generation of numbers
	for higher-dimensional universal discrete spaces
	Examples:  Finnish vowels, Hungarian vowels, Discrete Space for
	English vowels and dipthongs, Intro to Vector Spaces & formants

Sec IV: COMPOUND VOWELS & DIPTHONGS
	Vector Spaces, Basis, Dimension, Orthogonality. A vector space
	vowels, Trubetzkoy quantal vowels as basis orthonormal vectors
	Time-Domain And ArticulatorySpace-Domain Compositions of dipthongs, 
	glides, compound vowels. English dipthong examples. Semivowels.
	Degrees-of-freedom.

Sec V: SPECTRAL DOMAIN DESCRIPTIONS
	Time-domain signals, Frequency-domain descriptions, compound
	vowels, glides, dipthongs, Power Spectrum, Noise, Source
	and Filter model. Formant functions and approximations.
	
	This is where I am. I'm working on:
	Peterson& Barney, and Clark&Yallop results. Relation of
	formant-spaces to orthonormal spaces of previous sections.
	Scaling, Shearing, Rotation and Reflection Operators.
	First-Order Formant Function approximations.
	(Maybe Neural Networks, Graph-theoretic clustering)

These Sections will follow:

Section VI: CONTINUOUS VECTOR SPACES FOR CONSONANTS
	Quasi-consonants, vector spaces for vowels, semivowels,
	and consonants.  Dimensional Analysis and Buckingham
	Pi Theorem. Relations to the two-tube model of speech,
	Relation to the articulatory operations.
	(Probably examples as below:
	 from English, Serbo-Croation, Korean and Turkish;
	Syllabifier Finite Automaton, Mid-level metrics forlanguage
	characteristics, such as consonant clusters, use of dipthongs,
	etc. Context-Free Language for Describing Phoneme Level 
	Structure of Languages) 

(I'll probably be able to finish up to Section VI)

Section VII:  MORPHOLOGY, SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS
Section VIII: HIGH-LEVEL DISTANCE METRICS

(These two sections VII and VIII  are going to take a long time. Sometime
during the semester, I'll make a terse version available.)

And finally these two last sections will be made available as an
outline of sorts. They will be very short since they'll just
express general ideas. They'll depend on Sections VII and VIII, and
I can't give them away until they're ready.)

Section IX: THE FAMILY TREE
Section X: PROPAGATION AND DIFFUSION OF LINGUISTIC INNOVATION

Anyone who wants a copy will be sent one. All you have to do is
send me email with your name and address:

Please include your name and address exactly as you would
put it on an envelope. I'm going to print it the way it is
and use it as an address label.

PS. I'll be grateful to anyone who can make suggestions, ask for
clarification, give me references to works along similar lines so
that I don't have to re-invent any wheels. I'd also like to
give proper credit to people who've done things. But I can't promise
I'll incorporate every change and I can't promise I'll answer every
question in detail since my time is limited.

		ViewFinder: A Framework for Representing,
	       Ascribing and Maintaining Nested Beliefs of
			    Interacting Agents

			       Afzal Ballim

				 Abstract

Interacting with agents in an intelligent manner means that the computer
program is able to adapt itself to the specific requirements of agents.  The
dissertation is concerned with an important feature necessary for this
ability to adapt:  the use of models of the beliefs and knowledge of the
interacting agents.

The objective of this dissertation is to detail a theory of belief, by which
is meant a theory of how the contents of nested belief models are formed.
The work is motivated by (i) the aspects of representation, formation, and
revision of nested belief models that have been neglected, and (ii) the lack
of a unifying framework for all of these features of nested beliefs.

In much research involving models of the beliefs of agents, the models used
are pre-given.  While this is sufficient in highly constrained domains it is
inappropriate in general.  In more complex domains it is necessary to
dynamically generate these models.  This dissertation is directly concerned
with the problems of dynamically creating such nested models of the beliefs
of agents.

Major Contributions
===================

Using Stereotypes for Belief Ascription:  The use of stereotypes (in
particular, hierarchically organised stereotypes) is shown to be an
excellent method for making shallow belief models, i.e., the system's view
of another agent, but to suffer from serious problems as a mechanism for
making deeper ascriptions.  A precedence inheritance reasoner for
stereotypes is developed as this is necessary in shallow use of stereotypes,
in deep use, and in the fused ascription process later developed.

Perturbation as a Basis for Belief Ascription:  The perturbation model of
belief ascription is investigated, and shown to be excellent for generation
of deep belief models.  However, it relies upon beliefs generally being
common between the ascribing agent (the ascriber) and the agent to whom the
beliefs are being ascribed (the ascribee), and so is inadequate when this
assumption does not hold.

Ascription Operators:  The perturbation method of belief ascription relies
on counter-evidence to block ascription.  In the investigation of
counter-evidence a number of families of ascription operators are
identified.  In particular, a distinction is made between radical operators,
which can form a disjunctive result, and conservative operators which form a
unique result.  Different types of each of these operators are developed.

Weighing Evidence Sources:  The basic perturbation mechanism for belief
ascription intuitively implies a simple recursive algorithm.  This is shown
to be false.  It is demonstrated that pre-stored nested beliefs of the
agents involved in a nesting (and pre-stored beliefs of their views of each
other) must be considered as sources of evidence and counter-evidence for
ascription.  A method for totally ordering these evidence sources is
developed.

A Fused Approach:  The stereotype ascription and perturbation ascription are
fused together via the notion of atypical beliefs .  These are beliefs that
are only held by particular groups of agents.  A mechanism based on lambda
expressions is investigated for fusing atypicality into the perturbation
mechanism.  Evaluation of these lambda expressions in a nested environments
investigated, as to is the nature of transformations on them that is
required when they are ascribed from agent to agent.  Improvements are made
over previously descriptions of these processes.

Interpreted and Ascribed Beliefs:  Interpreted beliefs are those beliefs
attributed to an agent based on inferences from the utterances (or actions)
of the agent.  Ascribed beliefs are those beliefs attributed to an agent
based on principles of commonality and minimal evidence about the probable
background of the agent.  It is claimed that belief interpretation requires
belief ascription as a pre-requisite.  Further, although it might be
expected that interpreted beliefs would always be preferred to ascribed
ones, it is claimed that this is not necessarily the case and that this
largely depends on the inference rules used to interpret the beliefs.  It
follows that interpretation rules must be classed to give some indication of
the reliability of their inferences.

Maintenance of Nested Beliefs:  A number of aspects of belief revision with
respect to nested beliefs are considered.  It is claimed that it is
necessary to distinguish between simulating an agents own revision
mechanism, and making revisions of the belief model of the agent because the
model has proved to be wrong.  In addition, it is shown how either of these
changes can cause the system to want to change its own beliefs, but in
different ways.  Simulating the agents own revision process is more likely
to cause the system to make revisions of its beliefs about the domain, or
topic of conversation, while revisions on the belief model are more likely
to cause the system to make revisions of its beliefs about the agent.  An
operation known as percolation is devised to aid in the former revision
process.

A Framework for Environments:  A general framework for environments is
developed.  The framework is deliberately designed to be open-ended, i.e.,
not completely defined.  A number of important types of environment are
discussed.  It is shown how environments may be used as a mechanism for
reasoning about ordering relations, and how, thus, they provide an
appropriate medium for reasoning about different ordering relations, such as
confidence relations, inheritance leaning relations, etc.  Particular
attention is paid to the representational problems discussed in the
background section.

Ascription Operators as Environment Projection:  The ascription operators
previously developed are generalised to be operators that cause projection
of one environment on another.  Environment projection operators are studied
in more detail, and a number of extra projection operators are proposed,
including Bayesian projection, Fuzzy projection, and Logic Foundational
projection.

Environment Projection as a Fundamental Operator:  It is shown that
environment projection can be seen as a fundamental operator underlying many
important processes in AI, including belief ascription, inheritance
reasoning, truth maintenance, belief revision, merging of intensional
descriptions, and metaphor generation.  An environment framework may thus
serve as a basis for investigation, development, and implementation of all
of these processes.

			  Intentions in Time
		Robert P. Goldman and R. Raymond Lang
		      Technical Report TU 93-101

ABSTRACT:

Representing and reasoning about goal-directed actions is necessary in
order for autonomous agents to act in or understand the commonsense
world.  This paper provides a formal theory of intentional action
based on Bratman's characterization of intention.  Our formalization
profits from the insights developed by Cohen and Levesque in their
formalization of Bratman's theory.  We review Cohen and Levesque's
formalization and illustrate its weaknesses.  Using Allen's temporal
logic as a foundation, we construct a formalization that, like Cohen
and Levesque's, satisfies Bratman's desiderata for an acceptable
theory of intentional action.  We introduce a characterization of
success and failure of intentional action and show that our richer
theory of time allows us to formalize more complex intentional
actions, particularly those with deadlines.  Finally, we argue that
the use of a syntactic theory of belief allows us to accommodate a
more descriptive theory of intentional action by fallible agents.  Our
work has relevance to applications like multi-agent planning,
speech-act processing and narrative understanding.  We are pursuing
applications of this theory to representing the content of narratives
and to constructing and understanding description-based communication.

Subject: Position: post-doc/visiting scientists in HCI at NRL

Post-Doc / Visiting Scientist Positions

Human Computer Interaction Research

We are looking for a cognitive scientist or engineering psychologist
with a strong computer scince background to work on a project
titled "Human Machine Dialog."  This project focuses on human-human
dialogs as a model for human computer communication.  An important
aspect of the program is developing evaluation methods and training
guidelines.  Specific interest in individual differences is also
encouraged.
If interested, please call Dr. Astrid Schmidt-Nielsen (202) 767-2682 or
send e-mail to schmidtn@itd.nrl.navy.mil for more information.

The Human computer Interaction Laboratory at the Naval Research
Laboratory provides an
interdisciplinary research environment to address problems in interface
software design.  The approaches within the HCI Laboratory assume that
interface software provides the bi-directional communication of
information between humans and computers. Information can be in the
form of data, symbolic knowledge, or control specifics. Multi-modal
forms of communication are assumed. Research in the laboratory focuses
on developing software principles and methodologies useful to software
designers.  Current work emphasizes dialogue as
an organizing principle for the interactions.  Presently, research
spans efforts in interfaces for decision aids for avionics, novel
devices and their I/O styles, speech processing, and development of
evaluation and testing methodologies.  The novel devices research
includes aspects of telepresence and virtual environments.  Software
design within the research tasks provides the basis for our software
engineering approach to developing interface specifications
and requirements which are independent of the  applications. The goal
is to develop principles and methods for high-performance user-computer
interaction and supporting software architectures.  The Laboratory has
Post-Doc positions for computer scientists, cognitive researchers and
enigneering psychologists depending on availability of funding.

                   MESSAGE FROM THE PROGRAMME CHAIR
________________________________________________________________________

The biennial conferences of the Society for the Study of Artificial
Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour are traditionally
"single-track" scientific meetings aiming to bring together all areas
of research in AI and computational cognitive science, and AISB'93 is
no exception. With the end of the century close at hand, it seemed
appropriate to choose a forward looking theme, so the five invited
speakers, all distinguished researchers in their own sub-fields, have
been asked to identify trends and project into the future, instead of
simply surveying past achievements. Some but not all of the submitted
papers also analyse prospects; the others report on work already done.

The referees and the selection committee used as a major criterion for
selection the requirement that papers should be of interest to a
general AI audience. All of the papers have in common a commitment to
a "design-based" approach to the study of intelligence, though some of
them focus mainly on requirements, some mainly on designs and some on
actual implementations, and of course there is wide variation not only
regarding the sub-domains of AI (such as vision, learning, language,
emotions) but also between the techniques used (such as symbolic
reasoning, neural net models, genetic algorithms), and also between
those who attempt to design intelligent agents using a top down
analysis of human-like intelligence and those who work bottom up from
primitive insect-like mechanisms. There is also international variety,
with papers from several European countries and further afield.

This variety of topics and approaches promises to make the conference
particularly lively, with plenty of scope for controversy. We have
therefore decided to allow a little more time than usual for each item
in the programme, so that questions and discussions can add to the
interest.

There will also be poster presentations, where some work that could
not be included in the formal proceedings can be presented, and it is
expected that there will be book displays by major AI publishers and
possibly some displays and demonstrations by vendors of AI software
and systems. The conference will be preceded by a programme of seven
tutorials and workshops for which separate registration is available.

Integral Solutions Limited have agreed to present a prize of AI
software, including Poplog, and a place on one of their training
courses, for the paper voted "best presented" by the audience.

For those involved in AI and Cognitive Science, the conference is a
primary opportunity to meet, discuss and learn about current work. For
those new to these fields, the conference is a chance to become
acquainted with them in pleasant surroundings and to meet the people
involved. For full-time students, large reductions in registration
fees are offered.

The location of the conference is one of the attractive halls of
residence in a pleasant lakeside setting at one end of the campus of
the University of Birmingham. This is not very far from the city
centre, so a visit to one of the local attractions of the centre, such
as the renowned Symphony Hall, will require a journey of only a few
minutes by taxi or train. Single room accommodation has been booked,
and the auditorium is in the same building as the bedrooms and dining
room, so that the conference will provide excellent opportunities for
informal mixing and discussions. The number of rooms available is
limited, so early booking is recommended.

We look forward to seeing you and hope you enjoy the conference.

Aaron Sloman.

Workshop 4: 	Motivation, Emotions and Attention

Organiser:	Tim Read, 
		University of Birmingham

Time: 		Friday 2nd April 2.30 - 5pm 
________________________________________________________________________

An informal workshop will be held after lunch on Friday 2nd April
enabling further discussion of issues raised in the Thursday afternoon
session on motivation and emotions, and possibly additional
presentations. There will be no charge, though numbers will be limited
by available space. For more information contact

The study of emotion encounters many difficulties, among them the
looseness of emotional terminology in everyday speech. A theory of
emotion should supersede this terminology, and should connect with
such issues as motivation, control of attention, resource limitations
architectural parallelism and underlying biological mechanisms.

Computation provides useful analogies in generating an information
processing account of emotion, and computer modelling is a rigorous
and constructive aid in developing theories of affect.

It makes sense for researchers within this field to collaborate, and
the aim of the workshop is to facilitate cross-fertilisation of ideas,
sharing of experience, and healthy discussion.

Tutorial 1: 	Collaborative Human-Computer Systems:
		Towards an Integrated Theory of Coordination

		Dr Stefan Kirn
		University of Muenster, Germany

Time: 		Monday 29th March (morning)
________________________________________________________________________

Intelligent support of human experts' intellectual work is one of the
most competitive edges of computer technology today. Important
advances have been made in the fields of computer networking, AI
(e.g., KADS, CBR, Distributed AI), integrated design frameworks (the
European JESSI project), nonstandard databases (e.g., databases for
teamwork support), computer supported cooperative work, and
organizational theory. The time is ripe for developing integrated
human computer collaborative systems to significantly enhance the
problem solving capabilities of human experts. Perhaps one of the most
interesting challenges here is the development of an integrated theory
of human computer coordination. Such a theory will help to link humans
and computers together in order to let them collaboratively work on
complex "nonstandard" problems.  It is the aim of the tutorial to put
the loose ends of the above mentioned disciplines together thus
arguing towards the development of an integrated theory of human
computer coordination. Only undergraduate-level knowledge in at least
one of the following fields is assumed: AI, database/information
systems, organisational theory and CSCW.

Dr Stefan Kirn is senior researcher and project leader at the
Institute of Business and Information Systems of the Westfaelische
Wilhelms-University of Muenster. He has more than 30 major
publications in international journals and conferences, primarily in
the areas of DAI, Cooperative Information Systems, CSCW and
Computer-Aided Software Engineering.

Tutorial 2:	The Motivation, Meaning and Use of Constraints

		Dr Mark Wallace
		European Computer-Industry Research Centre
		Munchen, Germany.

Time: 		Monday 29th March (afternoon)
________________________________________________________________________

This tutorial explains how constraints contribute to clear, clean,
efficient programs.  We study constraints as specification tools, as
formal tools, and as implementation tools.  Finally we examine the use
of constraints in search and optimisation problems.  As the tutorial
unfolds, we will explain the three different notions of constraints:
constraints as built-in relations, with built-in solvers; constraints
as active agents, communicating with a store; and propagation
constraints.  We will also explain how these notions are related, and
moreover how the different types of constraints can all be combined in
a single program.  For programming examples, the logic programming
framework will be used.

It will be aimed at postgraduates, researchers and teachers of AI, who
would like to know what constraints are, and what they are for.  Also
anyone interested in declarative programming, seeking a solution to the
problem of efficiency, will benefit from the tutorial.  An understanding
of formal logic will be assumed, and some familiarity with logic
programming will be necessary to appreciate the programming examples.

Dr Mark Wallace leads the Constraints Reasoning Team at ECRC (the
European Computer-Industry Research Centre), Munich.  He introduced
"Negation by Constraints" at SLP'87. He has recently presented papers at
IJCAI'92, FGCS'92 and JFPL'92. Recent tutorial presentations include a
short course on Deductive and Object-Oriented Knowledge Bases at the
Technical University of Munich, and "Constraint Logic Programming - An
Informal Introduction", written with the CORE team at ECRC for the Logic
Programming Summer School, '92.

Tutorial 3:	A Little Turing and Goedel for Specialists in AI

		Prof. Alexis Manaster Ramer
		Wayne State University, USA.

Time: 		Monday 29th March (morning + afternoon)
________________________________________________________________________

Currently debated issues in the foundations of AI go directly back to
technical work of people like Turing and Godel on the power and limits
of formal systems and computing devices.  Yet neither the relevant
results nor the intellectual climate in which they arose are widely
discussed in the AI community (for example, how many know that Godel
himself believed that the human mind was not subject to the limits set
by his theorems on formal systems?).  The purpose of this tutorial is
to develop a clear picture of the fundamental results and their
implications as seen at the time they were obtained and at the present
time. We will primarily refer to the work of Godel, Turing, Chomsky,
Hinttika, Langendoen and Postal, Searle, and Penrose.  Some background
knowledge is assumed: some programming, some AI and some discrete
mathematics.

Dr Alexis Manaster Ramer is professor of Computer Science at Wayne
State University. He has over 100 publications and presentations in
linguistics, computational linguistics, and foundations of CS and AI.
A few years ago, he taught a short course on the theory of computation
for the Natural Language Processing group at the IBM T.J.Watson
Research Center (Hawthorne, NY, USA) and this past summer taught a
one-week advanced course on mathematics of language at the European
Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (Colchester, UK).

			         PACLING '93
       First Pacific Association for Computational Linguistics Conference

 	                   April 21-24 (Wed-Sat) 1993
	    The Harbour Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

CONFERENCE AIMS

PACLING '93 will be a workshop-oriented meeting on computational linguistics

countries, with emphasis on interdisciplinary scientific exchange showing 
openness towards good research falling outside current dominant "schools of 
thought," and on technological transfer within the Pacific region.

GUEST SPEAKERS, TITLES AND BRIEF ABSTRACTS

         "An Overview of JPSG -- A Constraint-Based Grammar for Japanese"
   		     Dr Takao Gunji, Osaka University, JAPAN

  An overview of an ongoing project called JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure 
  Grammar) is presented.  JPSG is an implementation of ideas from recent 
  developments in the phrase structure grammar formalism, such as HPSG, 
  applied to the Japanese language.  Even though JPSG shares many aspects 
  of grammatical formalization with HPSG, we have adopted a number of 
  extensions and modifications in our development.  We use an extended notion 
  of unification -- constraint unification -- which takes into account 
  declarative constraints, in addition to feature structures, so that the same 
  declarative description can be used both for generation and recognition. 

	   "Industrial Strength NLP: The Challenge of Broad Coverage"
                 Dr George E. Heidorn, Microsoft Research, USA

  To achieve apparent natural language understanding in consumer products, 
  the underlying NLP system will have to be very robust.  It will be 
  expected to do more than a limited task in a limited domain.  The NLP 
  group at Microsoft Research is developing a system which is intended to be 
  a central component for ubiquitous NLP.  This work is still in its early 
  stages, but we do have a system of some interest that runs on Windows 3.1 
  and produces reasonable logical forms for a fairly wide range of English 
  text.  This talk will describe the various facets of the work we are doing 
  and show some of the results we have obtained to date.  

               "Language Generation for Multimedia Explanations"
	        Dr Kathleen R. McKeown, Columbia University, USA

  Multimedia information systems have the potential to greatly increase the
  effectiveness with which information is communicated.  Whether language,
  visual media (e.g., pictures, charts, figures, etc.) or some combination
  are more appropriate for communication can depend on the kind of information 
  being communicated, on user ability or background, and on the situations in  
  which information is communicated.  Our work on COMET (COordinated 
  Multimedia Explanation Testbed) has as its goal the interactive generation 
  of explanations that fully integrate and coordinate text and graphics, all 
  of which is generated on the fly.  In this talk, I will focus on three ways 
  in which COMET coordinates its text and graphics: 1. cross references from 
  text to graphics, 2. coordination of sentence and picture breaks, and 3. 
  influence from one media on realization in another.

CALL FOR PAPERS

RO-MAN '93 TOKYO
The IEEE 2nd International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication
Session on Emotional Communication and Dialogue in Virtual Realities
Session moderator:  John K. Myers

November 3-5, 1993
Science University of Tokyo,   Tokyo, Japan

  Recently many researchers have begun to work with autonomous agents
in artificial realities.  The most challenging research in this area
focuses not only on single autonomous agents interacting with their
worlds, but also on multiple autonomous agents communicating with
each other through dialogues and emotional signals.  What are these
systems capable of doing?  What algorithms and operators are necessary?
Where will such systems go in the future?
  Human users are also experimenting with communication in virtual realities.
The recent popular Multiple User Dungeon (MUD) programs provide a way
for users to interact with each other in a new mode of communication.
What are the topics of these interactions?  What kinds of dialogue
patterns and strategies for emotional communication are used?
  A few leading-edge researchers are also exploring the problem of
how a robotic intelligence can communicate with a human user.
How does dialogue generation work?  What primitives are used for
emotional communication?  How can these be recognized or generated?
Real-world psychological problems include what kinds of commands
are used when talking with an autonomous agent (e.g., the "Knowledge
Navigator"), and how do people feel when talking to or with agents.
  In the not-so-distant future, a virtual-reality interface to
normal computers, intelligent computer agents, 
and to other users (the palantir telephone/TV) may be commonplace.  
What knowledge technologies will be required to achieve 
full communication?  How will these be used?  What problems will occur?

This session attempts to advance the state of the art by providing
a platform to disseminate cutting-edge and futuristic research 
on these topics.  Papers should emphasize the theoretical aspects
of communication, including but not limited to ontologies of emotional
and informative communicative acts, theories of emotions and of dialogue, 
algorithms for recognition, generation, and interaction,
psychological studies, etc., etc.  Speculations and projections
of what this technology will lead to in the future are encouraged.
Papers on implemented systems, and actual experiments, as well as 
position papers and well-thought-out theoretical designs are all welcomed.

Please submit five copies of an extended summary of 300-600 words,
together with one or two figures that best illustrate your work, to:
  John K. Myers
  American Film Technologies
  11585 Sorrento Valley Road
  San Diego, CA  
  92121   USA
to be received on or before May 3rd, 1993.  Rough drafts of papers 
are also welcome at this point.  Applicants will be notified of
acceptance or rejection by the end of June.  Successful applicants
will be requested to submit a final draft of 8 pages or less
by August 28th.  The official language of the workshop is English.
A proceedings will be published and distributed at the workshop.  

If you are even thinking of possibly submitting an extended summary,
I ask that you send your name, address, telephone number, and
e-mail address to:  myers@atr-la.atr.co.jp  before March 24th
if possible.  I am relocating, and this will aid in communication.

		 ICLP'93  Postconference Workshop on
                          Deductive Databases
      
                          Budapest, Hungary
                            June 25, 1993
      
       Sponsored by the Association of Logic Programming

One  of  the principal aims of  research  in deductive databases is to
provide   a  declarative  programming framework for building  database
applications.  The research  is  also concerned  with  alleviating the
shortcomings of  traditional database  programming languages like  SQL
etc.   A   deductive database   system  combines traditional  database
facilities with a powerful LOGIC-BASED language for queries, reasoning
and  application development. Recent  research  in this area  has been
closely  linked to  research  in Non-monotonic reasoning, Semantics of
logic programs and Ordered logic.

The workshop is intended to  bring together researchers (theoreticians
as well as practicioners) involved in the area of  deductive databases
and deductive computing. The aim is to  provide a forum for discussing
and exchanging  ideas on various  aspects of  deductive databases such
as:
	- Object-oriented deduction (i.e. hierarchies and deduction)
	- Negation
	- Non-monotonic deduction
	- Sets (matching and unification)
	- Paraconsistency
	- Abstract data types
	- Meta programming
	- Compilation techniques (magic sets, counting etc.)
	- Abstract machines (execution architectures and computational models)
	- Query optimization techniques
	- Applications

Papers   (full  papers and extended abstracts)   are solicited on  any
aspect of deductive databases. Papers must be written in English, must
not exceed 10 pages, and should include both  an abstract and keywords
to define the   topic.  Authors are   asked to submit four  copies  to
either Els Laenens or Natraj Arni at the addresses below.

Submit papers to either:

From: tale@uunet.uu.net (David C Lawrence)
Subject: Announcement: CFV: comp.ai.nat-lang

This is an official Call For Votes (CFV) for the formation of
the newsgroup, comp.ai.nat-lang

             Charter for comp.ai.nat-lang

Name:         comp.ai.nat-lang

Moderation:   This group will be unmoderated.

Purpose:      To discuss issues relating to natural language, especially
              computer-related issues from an AI viewpoint.   The topics
              that will be discussed in this group will concentrate on, but
              are not limited to, the following:

                   *   Natural Language Understanding
                   *   Natural Language Generation
                   *   Machine Translation
                   *   Dialogue and Discourse Systems
                   *   Natural Language Interfaces
                   *   Parsing
                   *   Computational Linguistics
                   *   Computer-Aided Language Learning

              This newsgroup will avoid discussing topics such as 
              speech synthesis, non computer-related linguistic
              issues, or other issues that are better addressed in
              other newsgroups such as comp.speech and sci.lang.
              However, because natural language processing is 
              interdisciplinary, some overlap will be inevitable.
              The topic list above should serve as a guide as to the
              nature of topics that should be discussed in this newsgroup.
              

Rules of Decorum:  Because of the unmoderated format, anyone with access to
                   this newsgroup will be able to post without being
                   pre-reviewed, as is the case with moderated groups.
                   This is meant to encourage discussion of the topics.
                   Please refrain from "flames" or unnecessary criticism
                   of a person's viewpoints or personality in a harsh
                   or insulting manner.   Criticisms should be constructive
                   and polite whenever possible.

Intended Audience:  While linguistics serves as one of the foundations
                    to natural language processing, this group is not
                    strictly meant for linguists.   This group is meant
                    to attract people from linguistics, AI, computer
                    science, philosophy, and psychology, (among others)
                    who have interest in natural language processing.
                    
                    Although this group is meant as a forum for those
                    people who work in the field of natural language
                    processing, and therefore some discussion may be
                    highly technical in nature, or may refer to work
                    that is commonly known for those in the field,
                    we should also be open to those who are just beginning
                    in the field, or who have an active interest in the field
                    but work in a different area.  Because this group
                    is unmoderated, there will be more noise (i.e., articles
                    that are deemed by some as unimportant) than were
                    this group moderated.   Please think of this as
                    a tradeoff that may lead to better discussion.

End of charter

Call For Votes
- -------------

Period of voting ends:    Monday, March 30, 1993. 23:59 Eastern Time.

                   Eastern Time is the time zone that I am in, which is the
                   same as Washington, DC, New York, Boston, and Atlanta.

Rules of voting:

     (1) Votes must be cast by e-mail only.   Votes may not be posted to the net.

     (2) You can NOT vote by proxy.   That means, you are not allowed to have
         a friend vote for you.   Therefore, you must have a e-mail address.
         Unless the moderator of news.announce.newsgroups says otherwise,
         I will not accept votes that are sent by anonymous locations (i.e.,
         using an anonymous service).

     (3) You may only vote once.   The determination of this will be made
         by e-mail address.  Unique e-mail addresses will count as one vote,
         subject to the approval of the moderator.  Please use your account
         when voting.   If there are multiple votes from one address, only
         the vote with the latest legal timestamp (i.e., the time that I
         receive the vote, not the time you sent it out) which falls in
         the time period above will be counted.

     (4) You must vote for the charter and newsgroup name, as is.   Votes
         which are qualified, such as "I would vote YES, if this happens"
         will not be counted.

     (5) Votes must be cast between the times given above in the period of voting.

     (6) Anyone who has an computer account which can send e-mail to me
         will be allowed to vote.

     (7) Votes must be sent to my e-mail address: clin@eng.umd.edu

How to Vote:

Instructions for those who SUPPORT the formation of comp.ai.nat-lang
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Use the following subject heading as close as you can.

   Subject: Vote: comp.ai.nat-lang: YES
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             This is the part you type.

(2) Within the body of the text, write

   I vote FOR the newsgroup, comp.ai.nat-lang, as proposed.

                         Last name, First name   

Instructions for those who OPPOSE the formation of comp.ai.nat-lang
- ------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Use the following subject heading as close as you can.

    Subject: Vote: comp.ai.nat-lang: NO
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             This is the part you type.

(2) Within the body of the text, write

    I vote AGAINST the newsgroup, comp.ai.nat-lang, as proposed.

                        Last name, First name.

**************

     I will send you e-mail if you have the incorrect format.   I will
not be so concerned as to the exactness of the body of the text, but
please try to follow the format for the subject heading.   By following
the format, it will be less ambiguous to me as to which way you are
voting.   The subject heading and the content should either both
support or both oppose the formation.   Any other combination will be
ignored.   Both must be included.   Please include your last name
and your first name.   When I post the votes, I will post in the order of last
name in alphabetical order.  Then I will include your "From:" line.

Example:  Lawrence, David: tale@uunet.uu.net (David C Lawrence)
          ^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          last name  first      e-mail address in "From" line

If you wish to confirm your vote, send me, in a separate e-mail from your
vote, a request for confirmation.   Please verify this confirmation by
reading further CFV posts which will list those people who have voted.
The actual tally of who voted FOR and AGAINST the newsgroup will be
displayed after the end of the voting period.

********

Other information:
   You may continue discussion about the newsgroup, but it should be to persuade
other voters to vote one way or the other.

1.0  MODULARITY AND MODULATION IN NEURAL NETWORKS

1.1  This book introduces a new neural network model, CALM, for
categorization and learning in neural networks. CALM is based on ideas
from neurobiology, psychology, and engineering. It defines a neural
network paradigm that is both modular and modulatory. CALM stands for
Categorizing And Learning Module and it may be viewed as a building
block for neural networks. The internal structure of the CALM module is
inspired by the neocortical minicolumn. Several of these modules are
connected to form an initial neural network architecture. Throughout
the book it is argued that modularity is important in overcoming many
of the problems and limitations of current neural networks. Another
pivotal concept in the CALM module is self-induced arousal, which may
modulate the local learning rate and noise level.

1.2  The concept of arousal has roots in both biology and psychology. In
CALM, this concept underlies two different modes of learning:
elaboration learning and activation learning. Mandler and coworkers
have conjectured that these two distinct modes of learning may cause
the dissociation of memory observed in explicit and implicit memory
tasks. A series of simulations of such experiments demonstrates that
arousal-modulated learning and categorization in modular neural
networks can account for experimental results with both normal and
amnesic patients. In the latter case, pathological but psychologically
accurate behavior is produced by "lesioning" the arousal system of the
model. The behavior obtained in this way is similar to that in patients
with hippocampal lesions, suggesting that the hippocampus may form
part of an arousal system in the brain.

1.3  Another application of CALM to psychological modelling shows how a
modular CALM network can learn the word superiority effect for letter
recognition. As an illustrative practical application, a small model is
described that learns to recognize handwritten digits.

2.0  MODULAR NEURAL ARCHITECTURES AND NEUROCOMPUTERS

2.1  The book contains a concise introduction to genetic algorithms, a
new computing method based on the metaphor of biological evolution that
can be used to design network architectures with superior performance.
In particular, it is shown how a genetic algorithm results in a better
architecture for the digit-recognition model.

2.2  In five appendices, the role of modularity in parallel hardware and
software implementations is discussed in some depth. Several hardware
implementations are considered, including a formal analysis of their
efficiency on transputer networks and an overview of a dedicated 400-
processor neurocomputer built by the developers of CALM in cooperation
with Delft Technical University. One of the appendices is dedicated to
a discussion of the requirements of simulators for modular neural
networks.

3.0  CATASTROPHIC INTERFERENCE AND OTHER ISSUES

3.1  The book ends with an evaluation of the psychological and
biological plausibility of CALM models and a discussion of
generalization, representational capacity of modular neural networks,
and catastrophic interference. A series of simulations and a detailed
analysis of Ratcliff's simulations of catastrophic interference show
that in almost all cases interference can be attributed to overlap of
hidden-layer representations across subsequent blocks of stimuli. It is
argued that introducing modularity, or some other form of
semidistributed representations, may reduce interference to a more
psychologically plausible level.

0. KEYWORDS: comprehension, cognitive processes, sentence comprehension,
             psycholinguistics

1. Language can be viewed as a specialized skill involving
language-specific processes and language-specific mechanisms. Another
view is that language (both comprehension and production) draws
on many general cognitive processes and mechanisms. According to this
view, some of the same processes and mechanisms involved in producing
and comprehending language are involved in nonlinguistic tasks.

2. This commonality might arise because, as Lieberman (1984) and others
have suggested, language comprehension evolved from nonlinguistic
cognitive skills. Or the commonality might arise simply because the
mind is best understood by reference to a common architecture (e.g., a
connectionist architecture).

3. I have adopted the view that many of the processes and mechanisms
involved in language comprehension are general ones. This book
describes a few of those cognitive processes and mechanisms, using a
simple framework -- the Structure Building Framework -- as a guide.

4. According to the Structure Building Framework, the goal of
comprehension is to build a coherent mental representation or
"structure" of the information being comprehended. Several component
processes are involved. First, comprehenders lay foundations for their
mental structures. Next, they develop their mental structures by
mapping on information when that incoming information coheres with the
previous information. If the incoming information is less coherent,
however, comprehenders engage in another cognitive process: They shift
to initiate a new substructure. So, most representations comprise
several branching substructures.

5. The building blocks of these mental structures are memory nodes.
Memory nodes are activated by incoming stimuli. Initial activation
forms the foundation of mental structures. Once the foundation is laid,
subsequent information is often mapped onto a developing structure
because the more coherent the incoming information is with the previous
information, the more likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. In
contrast, the less coherent the incoming information is, the less
likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. In this case, the
incoming information might activate a different set of nodes, and the
activation of this other set of nodes forms the foundation for a new
substructure.

6. Once memory nodes are activated, they transmit processing signals,
either to enhance (boost or increase) or to suppress (dampen or
decrease) other nodes' activation. In other words, two mechanisms
control the memory nodes' level of activation: Enhancement and
Suppression. Memory nodes are enhanced when the information they
represent is necessary for further structure building. They are
suppressed when the information they represent is no longer as
necessary.

7. This book describes the three subprocesses involved in structure
building, namely: the Process of Laying a Foundation for mental
structures; the Process of Mapping coherent information onto developing
structures; and the Process of Shifting to initiate new substructures.
The book also describes the two mechanisms that control these
structure building processes, namely: the Mechanism of Enhancement,
which increases activation, and the Mechanism of Suppression, which
dampens activation.

8. in discussing these processes and mechanisms, I begin by describing
the empirical evidence to support them. I then describe comprehension
phenomena that result from them. At each point, I stress that I assume
that these processes and mechanisms are general; that is, the same ones
should underlie nonlinguistic phenomena. This suggests that some of the
bases of individual differences in comprehension skill might not be
language specific. I describe how I have investigated this hypothesis
empirically.

9. The process of laying a foundation is described in Chapter 2.
Because comprehenders first lay a foundation, they spend more time
reading the first word of a clause or sentence, the first sentence of a
paragraph or story episode, and the first word of a spoken clause or
spoken sentence; they also spend more time viewing the first picture of
a picture story or picture story episode.

10. Comprehenders use these first segments (initial words, sentences,
and pictures) to lay foundations for their mental representations of
larger units (sentences, paragraphs, and story episodes). Because
laying a foundation consumes cognitive effort, comprehenders slow down
in understanding initial segments. Indeed, none of these comprehension
time effects emerges when the information does not lend itself to
building cohesive mental representations, for example, when the
sentences, paragraphs, or stories are self-embedded or scrambled.

11. The process of laying a foundation explains why comprehenders are
more likely to recall a sentence when cued by its first content word
(or a picture of that first content word); why they are more likely to
recall a story episode when cued by its first sentence; and why they
are more likely to consider the first sentence of a paragraph the main
idea of that paragraph, even when the actual theme occurs later.

12. Initial words, sentences, and pictures are optimal cues because
they form the foundations of their clause-level, sentence-level, and
episode-level structures; only through initial words, sentences, and
pictures can later words, sentences, and pictures be mapped onto the
developing representation.

13. Laying a foundation explains why comprehenders access the
participant mentioned first in a clause faster than they access a
participant mentioned later. This Advantage of First Mention occurs
regardless of the first-mentioned participant's syntactic position or
semantic role. First-mentioned participants are more accessible because
they form the foundation of their clause-level substructures.

14. Laying a foundation also explains why the first clause of a
multi-clause sentence is most accessible shortly after comprehenders
hear or read that multi-clause sentence (even though while they are
hearing or reading the sentence, the most recent clause is most
accessible). According to the Structure Building Framework,
comprehenders represent each clause of a multi-clause sentence in its
own substructure. Although they have greatest access to the information
that is represented in the substructure that they are currently
developing, at some point, the first clause becomes most accessible
because the substructure representing the first clause forms the
foundation for the whole sentence-level structure.

15. The processes of mapping and shifting are described in Chapter 3.
The process of mapping explains why sentences that refer to previously
mentioned concepts (and are, therefore, referentially coherent) are
read faster than less referentially coherent sentences; why sentences
that maintain a previously established time frame (and are, therefore,
temporally coherent) are read faster than sentences that are less
temporally coherent; why sentences that maintain a previously
established location or point of view (and are, therefore, locationally
coherent) are read faster than sentences that are less locationally
coherent; and why sentences that are logical consequences of previously
mentioned actions (and are, therefore, causally coherent) are read
faster than sentences that are less causally coherent.

16. The process of shifting from actively building one substructure to
initiating another explains why words and sentences that change the
topic, point of view, location, or temporal setting take substantially
longer to comprehend. The process of shifting also explains why
information presented before a change in topic, point of view,
location, or temporal setting is harder to retrieve than information
presented afterward. Such changes trigger comprehenders to shift and
initiate a new substructure; information presented before comprehenders
shift is not represented in the same substructure as information
presented afterward.

17. Shifting also explains a well known language comprehension
phenomenon: Comprehenders quickly forget the exact form of recently
comprehended information. This phenomenon is not unique to language; it
also occurs while comprehenders are viewing picture stories; and it is
also exacerbated after comprehenders cross episode boundaries, even the
episode boundaries of picture stories.

18. Finally, shifting explains why comprehenders' memories for stories
are organized by the episodes in which the stories were originally
heard or read. Comprehenders shift in response to cues that signal a
new episode; each episode is hence represented in a separate
substructure.

19. The mechanisms of suppression and enhancement are described in
Chapter 4. The suppression mechanism explains why only the contextually
appropriate meaning of an ambiguous word, such as bug, is available to
consciousness although multiple meanings -- even contextually
inappropriate ones -- are often immediately activated. The
inappropriate meanings do not simply decay; neither do they decrease in
activation because their activation is consumed by the appropriate
meanings. Rather, the suppression mechanism dampens the activation of
inappropriate meanings. It also dampens the activation of less relevant
associations of unambiguous words.

20. Suppression and enhancement explain how anaphors (such as pronouns,
repeated noun phrases, and so forth) improve their antecedents'
accessibility. Anaphors both enhance their antecedents' activation and
suppress the activation of other concepts, with the net effect that
after anaphoric reference, antecedents are more activated than other
concepts. They are accordingly more accessible.

21. Suppression and enhancement are triggered by information that
specifies the anaphor's identity. More explicit anaphors trigger more
suppression and enhancement. Information from other sources (such as
semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic context) also triggers suppression,
but it does so less quickly and less powerfully.

22. Suppression and enhancement explain why speakers and writers use
more explicit anaphors at longer referential distances, at the
beginnings of episodes, and for less topical concepts. The mechanisms
of suppression and enhancement also explain why comprehenders have more
difficulty accessing referents at longer referential distances, at the
beginnings of episodes, and for less topical concepts.

23. Suppression and enhancement explain how concepts marked with
cataphoric devices, like spoken stress and the indefinite article,
"this," gain a privileged status in comprehenders' mental
representations. Cataphoric devices enhance the activation of the
concepts they mark. They also improve their concepts' representational
status through the suppression: Concepts marked with cataphoric devices
are better at suppressing the activation of other concepts, and they
are better at resisting being suppressed themselves.

24. Finally, the mechanisms of suppression and enhancement explain why
comprehenders typically forget surface information faster than they
forget thematic information; why comprehenders forget more surface
information after they hear or read thematically organized passages
than after they hear or read seemingly unrelated sentences; and why
comprehenders better remember the surface forms of abstract sentences
and the thematic content of concrete sentences.

25. Individual differences in structure building are described in
Chapter 5. The Structure Building Framework explains why skill in
comprehending linguistic media (written and spoken stories) is closely
related to skill in comprehending nonlinguistic media (picture
stories). Comprehensible information, regardless of its medium, is
structured, and comprehenders differ in how skillfully they use the
cognitive processes and mechanisms that capture this structure.

26. The process of shifting explains why less-skilled comprehenders are
poorer at remembering recently comprehended information: They shift too
often. The mechanism of suppression explains why less-skilled
comprehenders are less able to reject the contextually inappropriate
meanings of ambiguous words; why they are less able to reject the
incorrect forms of homophones; why they are less able to reject the
typical-but-absent members of nonverbal scenes; why they are less able
to ignore words written on pictures; and why they are less able to
ignore pictures surrounding words: Less-skilled comprehenders have
inefficient suppression mechanisms.

27. The distinction between the mechanisms of suppression and
enhancement explains why less-skilled comprehenders are not less able
to appreciate the contextually appropriate meanings of ambiguous words
and why they are not less able to appreciate typical members of
nonverbal scenes. It is less-skilled comprehenders' suppression
mechanisms, not their enhancement mechanisms, that are faulty.

28. Although the Structure Building Framework accounts parsimoniously 
for many comprehension phenomena, several questions remain unanswered.
In the final chapter, I briefly identify just a few of those questions:
Are the cognitive processes and mechanisms indentified by the Structure
Building Framework automatic, or are they under comprehenders'
conscious control? In what medium are mental structures and
substructures represented? How is the Structure Building Framework
similar to other approaches to describing comprehension? And what is
lost by describing language comprehension at a general level?

29. I conclude that by describing language comprehension using the
Structure Building Framework as a guide, I am not forced to accept
nativism, to isolate the psychology of language from the remainder of
psychology, to honor theory over data, to depend on linguistic theory,
or to ignore functionalism. Instead, by describing language
comprehension as structure building, I hope to map the study of
language comprehension onto the firm foundation of cognitive
psychology.

Target articles should normally not exceed 500 lines in length
(commentaries and responses should not exceed 200 lines). All target
articles must have (1) a short abstract (<100 words), (2) an indexable
title, (3) 6-8 indexable keywords, and the (4) author's full name and
institutional address. The submission should be accompanied by (5) a
rationale for soliciting commentary (e.g., why would commentary be
useful and of interest to the field? what kind of commentary do you
expect to elicit?) and (6) a list of potential commentators (with their
email addresses). Commentaries must have indexable titles and the

    "Formalization of Semantic Networks for Neural Networks",

  In this paper, a formalization of semantic networks which is suitable
for representing by patterns on neural networks is proposed.  In order
to represent semantic networks on neural networks, we focus on the
function of semantic networks to track concepts along links between
concepts, and incorporate a topology into concept sets in order to
represent rules.  Furthermore, I present a method how to determine
semantic networks by external behavior.  Moreover, I show an example
of implementation this formalization into neural networks.

    "Natural Language Processing System that consists of Cooperative Modules",

  In this presentation, we describe a plan of a system for natural
language processing that is based on "cooperative" principle.  This
system consists of several modules of lexicon, syntax, semantics and
so on and each module runs parallel without control from each other. 
These modules try to have a hypothesis in the field where they work,
and in order to do this they exchange information to confirm or change
hypotheses of each module.  But if necessary, each module can work
alone although in low quality. So even if some module can not perform
its work, other modules can output some hypothesis without deadlock.
This means that the system can analyze semantics of sentence that is
illegal in syntax.
  The main aim of this project is to show how useful the programming
based on cooperative principle is.  If this programing style is good,
we will be able to build complex systems like natural language
processing and add a new module to the system without wholly changing
the system.

Conference Themes
=================

With successful conferences in Venice (1988 and 1990) and in Vienna
(1992), EDBT has established itself as Europe's premier international
conference on databases.

EDBT 94 in Cambridge will provide a forum for the latest results in the
research, development and use of database technology, and will encourage
active interchange between all those involved in this field.

The UK has a strong database research community, leading international
technology suppliers, and it has many large commercial users of database
systems.  Their presence will ensure a high level of debate.

Major topics for the conference will include, but are not limited to:

 - Client-Server and open networked database systems

 - Distributed database techniques

 - Advanced transaction processing techniques

 - Object-Oriented, Deductive, and Active databases

 - Multimedia and hypermedia database systems

 - Advanced user interfaces for data manipulation

 - Databases and programming systems

 - Information resource dictionaries/repositories

 - Highly parallel database systems

 - Advanced database applications

 - Database implementation (query optimisation, integrity and security)

In addition to the presented papers, the conference will include panel
discussions, industrial sessions, and high quality tutorials by
internationally recognised speakers.  There will be an accompanying
exhibition.

Conference Location
===================

Cambridge is Britain's leading scientific university.  It has a rich
history of innovation in many fields, including some of the earliest
work on the stored program computer, and is a centre for modern high
technology industry.  The city is set in beautiful countryside, and
contains some of Europe's finest university architecture in a unique
riverside setting facing "The Backs".

The conference and residential accommodation will be in St John's
College, which dates from the 16th century.  The college is situated on
both banks of the River Cam, connected by the famous "Bridge of Sighs"
which we have featured in our conference logo, and is well equipped with
all facilities.  Main sessions will be in the modern Fisher Building.

Cambridge is less than one hour from London by road or rail, and it has
excellent links with continental Europe.  Sea travellers may reach
Cambridge from the ferry ports at Felixstowe (66 miles), Harwich (87
miles) or Dover (122 miles).  Nearby international airports are Stansted
(24 miles), Heathrow (83 miles) or Gatwick (93 miles), all with good
coach, rail and motorway connections.  The opening of the Calais-Dover
tunnel adds another direct travel option for visitors from the
continent.

TIM VAN GELDER
"Distributed Represenation--An Outline"

What is distributed representation?  This question is central to
many practical and philosophical concerns, both in connectionism and in
cognitive science more generally, yet it has never been given an answer
that is both comprehensive and precise.  In this talk I propose a way
of defining distribution that, on one hand, reveals the fundamental
similarity between (for example) the gross functional neuroanatomy of
the various brain areas and connectionist hidden unit activity patterns,
while on the other is strict enough to yield mathematically precise
descriptions in real modeling contexts.  The key concept is that of
semantic superimposition; I elaborate this suprisingly tricky concept,
offer a formal framework rendering it precise, and explain how
superimposition can be incorporated into a general definition of
distributed representation.  

DAVID BANACH
"Representing, Similarity, and the Storage of Information"

Representing is an activity, a process through which a subject cognizes
the world.  Most theories of representation take one element or
component of this activity and identify it as the representation by
attributing to the element, in isolation, properties it has only in the
context of the act of representing.  In particular, I argue that the
similarity of an icon to an object is neither necessary nor sufficient
for representation and that seeing why this is so reveals fundamental
defects with views that see representations as (1) stored information,
which represents in virtue of an isomorphism effected by an information
storage and retrieval algorithm; or (2) as a distributed pattern of
activity over a set of units or phase space, which represents in virtue
of a topological isomorphism to the represented object.  All of these
models identify the representation with some element of the cognitive
process that cannot intrinsically represent apart from its situation in
a wider context.  I argue that such models of representation will fail
to account for the cognitive role of representation as long as they
mistake part of the representing process for the representating itself.

ANN ROBYNS
"Primary and Mature Conceptual Structures--Evidence from Child Language"

Currently, in semanic enquiry some researchers represent  
lexical-conceptual structure as an architecture of sets and truth
conditions. Others borrow from psychology such terms as 'conceptual 
primitives', 'canonical' and 'marginal' structures, and 'prototypes' 
(e.g. Jackendoff, 1990).  The documentation of usage of verb argument
structures, may shed considerable light on this division.  Differentials
in production of argument structures by children over time may shed light
on the construction of underlying representations.  These differences over
time appear to also have an effect on complexity of context sentences.
Production of tense, mood and negation markers appears to be contingent
on the stability of conceptual structures underlying production of
arguments.  The current study supports the view that childrens'
conceptual structures can be characterized as prototypes, and that
gradual extension of structures is contingent on transition to new
prototypes.  Early on (1968), Fillmore advocated the need for distinct
treatment of propositional and modal information.  Our results show that
the presence of modality in a sentence is contingent on high-frequency
argument structures.  If the development of modality (in Fillmore's sense)
and propositional content are distinguishable but show this relation, how is
it to be characterized? Jackendoff (1990) distinguishes between I-languages
(internal, based on innate predispositions) and E-languages (input-dependent).  
He holds that truth-conditional semantics requires a theory of language
as an abstract artifact extrinsic to speakers.  A possible interpretation of
our findings is that modality overlayed on propositional content may be the 
means whereby this abstract artifact is reconstructed as part of a speaker's 
internal representation.  Truth-conditional semantics, then, involves 
modelling mature inferential processes, or mature representation.  This 
possibility will be examined in light of actual developmental sequences, where 
modal forms can be shown to emerge gradually to condition verb meaning
in ways at least reminiscent of model theoretic semantics.

JOHN KOUNIOS and PHILLIPS HOLCOMB
"Inferring Semantic-Memory Structure from Behavioral and Electrophysiological
Measures"

Researchers have investigated the structure of semantic-memory
representations by examining subjects' performance in tasks in which
they must judge the truth of sentences relating familar categories
(e.g., _ALL DOGS ARE ANIMALS_., or _SOME PEOPLE ARE TREES_.).
Differences in time to verify various classes of sentences were initally
interpreted in terms of characteristics of the semantic representations
retrieved from memory.  Subsequent investigators have reinterpreted
these findings in terms of characteristics of the verification
_processes_ operating on these representations, rather than in terms of
the representations themselves.  We have taken a different approach.
Instead of inferring the nature of knowledge representations based on
how people _use_ them (i.e., "behavioral" response date), we have been
investigating electrical protentials in the brain during sentence
verification.  A certain component of these potentials seems to reflect
the _access_ or _retrieval_ of the stored knowledge, and not the
processes that use this information to judge truth.  These
access/retrieval mechanisms better reflect structural characteristics of
semantic memory than do behavioral measures, yielding a different
picture of semantic-memory structure.

VINOD GOEL
"Specifying Classifying Representational Systems:  A Critique and Proposal for
Cognitive Science"

Much of the work in cognitive science presupposes a theory of
representation complete with a classification scheme; a scheme which
allow us to say that two representations are interestingly similar or
interestingly different for particular purposes.
It is argued that such a scheme needs to meet at least the following
eight constraints:

(i)  It must be grounded in some intuitions or a discipline-specific theory;
(ii)  It must not beg the crucial questions;
(iii) It must result in an interesting number of categories (i.e.,
something other than a unit or infinite number);
(iv) It must individuate on the basis of relevant/constitutive
properties of symbol systems;
(v) It must be readily applicable;
(vi) It must be widely applicable;
(vii)  The distinctions must be detectable by our behavioral data and
methodology;
(viii)  It must be compatible with the computational story of mind.

The most widely used apparatus for classifying symbol systems is that of
informational and computational equivalence.  This is critiqued and
found wanting on most accounts.  A diagnosis of the problem is offered.
Time permitting, some prescriptive suggestions will also be made.

STEVEN HORST
"Notions of Representation and the Diverging Interests of Philosophy and
Empirical Science"

Contemporary discussions of mental representation often seem to assume that 
there is a single sense of the word `representation' that (a) is applied 
univocally to such disparate objects as pictures, maps and symbols, (b) is 
utilized by empirical researchers in cognitive science, and (c) can readily be 
used to provide a philosophical account of intentionality. In fact, however,
the notion of "representation" is paradigm-driven, and all of the familiar 
paradigms (symbols, etc.) are convention- or interpretation-dependent. This 
undercuts one philosophical strategy for explaining the content of mental 
states in representational terms.   However, a non-conventional notion of 
"representation" as a theoretical term can be developed which seems to capture 
the empirical scientist's needs even if it does not explain the intentionality
of mental states. This accords well with the following view of the importance 
of the computer paradigm: that what  it provides is (i) a formalism for the 
mathematization of psychology and (ii) suggestive strategies for
microexplanation.
   
JOHN F. SOWA:
"Logic Foundations for Representing Object-Oriented Systems"

Systems of logic that have equivalent expressive power may have very
different structure.  Short, simple statements in one system can often
be expressed only by awkward circumlocutions in another.  During the
last quarter of the nineteenth century, three complete systems of
first-order logic were developed:  Frege's Begriffsschrift, Peirce's
linear form of predicate calculus, and Peirce's existential graphs.
This talk compares the structures of propositions stated in these
systems to one another and to the underlying semantic structures of
language.  Of the three, existential graphs have the most direct
translations to natural language.  Remarkably, they are isomorphic
to Kamp's discourse representation structures that were independently
developed over 80 years later.  They also form the logical foundation
for conceptual graphs, which are based on research on semantic
networks in artificial intelligence.  Although Peirce's linear notation
has proved to be a powerful tool for foundational studies in mathematics,
his existential graphs seem better suited to studies of language.
[Note:  This is the abstract of Sowa's oral presentation; the written
version differs somewhat.]

BARBARA L. SPEICHER
"Disentangling Conceptual and Linguistic Knowledge"   
   
Language is the principal mediator of thought and one of the few vehicles with 
which to explore abstract conceptual structures.  Cognitive psychologists use 
linguistic evidence to study psychological functions such as memory and 
categorization and to construct models of knowledge representation. However, 
researchers  in cognitive psychology seldom address how to disentangle 
conceptual and linguistic knowledge. In fact, the field seems to assume that 
the two systems are isomorphic. The related field of neurology provides 
insights into the relationship between cognition and language. Findings from 
both split-brain and aphasic populations encourage a separation of linguistic 
and conceptual structures. Specifically, Antonio Damasio's neurological theory
of convergence zones is presented and used to explain the differential 
cognitive and linguistic abilities of neurologically impaired individuals 
such as split-brain populations and aphasic populations. The paper analyuzes 
both simple concepts and complex conceptual structures known as scripts.    
    
BARBARA ABBOTT and LARRY HAUSER
"Natural Language and Thought"    

Hauser defends the proposition that our languages of thought are public 
languages. One group of arguments points to the coincidence of clearly 
productive thought with overt possession of recursive symbol systems.  Another 
group relies on phenomenological experiences of mental discourse and making 
thoughts physical. A third group cites practical considerations, e.g.  Occam's 
razor and the `streetlight principle' (look under the lamp) motivating looking 
for instantiations of outer languages in thought first.    
Abbott points to the literature and adduces a number of specific replies to
Hauser.  Examples of productive behavior showing that natural language is not 
necessary for productive thought include problem solving by chimpanzees, dreams,
and feral human cases (Genie).  On phenomenological and practical grounds, 
Abbott argues that communication of thoughts should be trivial if the inner 
language is the outer language, but it is not; the decryption analogy Hauser 
uses to apply the `streetlight principle' is flawed; and Occam's razor doesn't 
cut any ice with Mother Nature.    
    
MICHAEL TARR
"Behavioral and Computational Constraints in Human Shape Representation" 
    
Do visual representations use an object-centered or viewer-centered
reference frame?  Studies suggest that recognition is
orientation-dependent under many circumstances. The resulting theory,
Multiple-Views-Plus-Transformations, hypothesizes that recognition is
achieved by using a mental transformation to match input shapes to
object representations in a viewer-centered reference frame. Moreover,
these representations are orientation-specific, e.g.  "views", and are
stored according to the frequency of occurrence of an object in a
particular orientation. However, familiarity is not the only factor
that determines represented views.  First, there is evidence that views
are contingent upon the frequency with which other objects appear at
particular orientations.  Representations of familiar objects in novel
views may arise as a result of the frequent appearance of an object's
visually similar cohorts. Second, there is evidence that views are
contingent upon the geometry of an object. The likelihood of a
representation arising increases with the distinctiveness of visible
surfaces at each orientation -- novel orientations are likely to be
represented to the extent that their geometry is unique,  while
orientations in which the geometry differs only slightly from that
depicted in preexisting views are unlikely to be represented.

WHITMAN RICHARDS
"Is Perception for Real?"

What is the relation between the "external" world and our
conceptualization of this world?  At one extreme an independent
external reality is denied, whereas at the other, an external reality
is a requirement for any conceptualization.  Perception lies at the
heart of this controversy:  can our percepts really reflect (or
approximate) the true structure of the world independent of our
observations or not?  To address this question we need a clear
understanding of just what a percept is and what it entails.  I offer
one definition and provide support for this choice using examples from
vision (Jepson & Richards 1991).  For our percepts to be useful,
enabling us to predict the consequences of events and actions, certain
conditions must be met.  Two I will discuss are (1) the ability to
manipulate representations or internal models, and (2) criteria for
data (observations) which generate reliable interpretations.  This
second condition imposes limitations on the scope of useful percepts,
and shows that percepts (perhaps like scientific theories?) are
critically dependent upon a matching of cognitive concepts to modal
regularities in the world.

K. N. LEIBOVIC
"Brain Mechanisms for Perceptual Representation"

The brain is designed on a pattern of converging and diverging fiber
tracts with their associated broadly tuned receptive and responsive
fields. This puts certain constraints on the processing, transmission
and representation of information. The properties of perceptive fields
and target cells are taken as neural analogs of cognitive and logical
operations.  Analysis and synthesis can then be carried out in
parallel; and the neural representations of elementary constituents
and  categorical constructs can be grounded in associational programs
of activity in groups of cells.

Abstract

How can students of all ages use the computer to model the real 
world?   Modelling systems which iteratively solve difference 
equations are now common,  and useful for older students.   But 
they require that the world be imagined as composed of variables, 
not things.  And they need some minimum mathematical 
sophistication.  This paper discusses two new modelling tools 
suitable for quite young students,  which could provide an 
introduction to modelling.   One tool allows systems of variables 
to be constructed,  without having to specify mathematical 
relations between them.   The other provides for interacting 
objects whose behaviour can be specified,  again without 
mathematics,  through drawing Tbefore and afterU pictures to 
express interactions of objects.   It is argued that the different types 
of models fit naturally into a developmental sequence,  matching 
modelling at various ages to student's intellectual growth.   A 
radical re-sequencing of teaching about Mathematics in Science is 
proposed.

To create a world,  whether constituted of variables or of objects,   
and to watch it evolve is a remarkable experience.   It can teach 
one what it means to have a model of reality,   which is to say 
what it is to think.    It can show both how good and how bad such 
models can be.    And by becoming a game played for its own sake 
it can be a beginning of purely theoretical thinking about forms.  
The microcomputer brings something of this within the reach of 
most pupils and teachers.

                        9th Annual Conference of the
      University of Waterloo Centre for the New OED and Text Research

                          September 27 - 28, 1993
                             St. Cross Building
                              Oxford, England

     The  Ninth Annual Conference of the University of Waterloo Centre
     for  the  New  OED  and  Text  Research, jointly sponsored by the
     University  of  Waterloo and the Oxford University Press, will be
     held  at  St.  Cross  Building (with accommodations at St. Edmund
     Hall), Oxford, England, on September 27-28, 1993.

     This  year's  conference will focus on computational solutions to
     problems of equivalence among words and phrases.  Within lexicog-
     raphy,  one of the most important problems in this area is one of
     grouping  equivalents:  sifting  through corpus citations to form
     sense  groups.   Within lexicology and computational linguistics,
     there  are problems of finding equivalents: matching citations to
     dictionary   senses,   aligning   one  dictionary's  senses  with
     another's,  and  aligning parts of texts with their translations.
     In  related  fields,  there  are problems of forming equivalents:
     generating  translations,  expanding full-text queries to include
     synonyms,   and  tailoring  texts  to  suit  specific  audiences.
     Conference  participants will again include researchers from com-
     puter science and the humanities, as well as representatives from
     publishing houses and other industries.

     Papers  presenting  original  research on theoretical and applied
     aspects of the theme are being sought.  Typical but not exclusive
     areas of interest include computational lexicology, computational
     linguistics, syntactic and semantic analysis, computational lexi-

	 Corpus-Based Frequency Count of Modern Chinese

Corpus-based study of Chinese is one of the research projects of
the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group (CKIP) at
Academia Sinica.  The current research is based on a Chinese
newspaper corpus, which amounts to 20,698,116 characters (
9,540,444 words after word segmentation.)  Four technical reports
in Chinese are published.  These include:

1. Corpus-Based Frequency Count of Characters in Journal Chinese
   30 pages (US$ 5)
2. Corpus-Based Frequency Count of Words in Journal Chinese
   300 pages (US$ 20)
3. The Most Frequent Verbs in Journal Chinese and Their
Classification
   140 pages (US$ 10)
4. The Most Frequent Nouns in Journal Chinese and Their
   Classification   150 pages (US$ 10)

The first report lists 5,666 distinct characters which appear in
the entire corpus.  The second report contains 42,686 words that
occur more than three times in the corpus.   The most common 14,956
words constitute more than 99.9995 percent of all the words
occurring in the corpus.  The third and the fourth report include
19,907 verbs and 21,368 nouns respectively which occur more than
twice in the corpus with their syntactic or semantic
classification.  To order, please list the desired title(s) and

Subject: Announcement: HCRC Map Task Corpus on CD

			The HCRC Map Task Corpus

The Human Communication Research Centre (HCRC) is happy to announce
the release of the Map Task Corpus. The Map Task Corpus is a set of 8
CD-ROMs containing linked audio and transcriptions of a total of about
18 hours of spontaneous speech that was recorded from 128 two-person
conversations according to a detailed experimental design.

Altogether, the corpus as distributed provides a thorough and
invaluable set of resources and tools for use in analyzing all levels
of linguistic structure, via both text-based and speech-based
investigation.  The range of research questions that are addressable
using this corpus span a wide spectrum of linguistic and cognitive
issues.  We have kept the price as low as possible to encourage
researchers from many disciplines to use this corpus as a common
reference point for many different kinds of research.

The HCRC is an interdisciplinary research centre at the Universities
of Edinburgh and Glasgow, supported by the UK Economic and Social
Research Council and the Universities Funding Council.  The publication
of the Map Task Corpus was made possible by assistance from the
Linguistic Data Consortium.

Corpus Details

64 different speakers, 32 female, 32 male, all adults, each took part
in four conversations in a quiet recording studio.  They were all
students at the University of Glasgow, 61 of them being native Scots.
The conversations were carried out in an experimental setting in which
each participant has a schematic map in front of them, not visible to
the other. Each map is comprised of an outline and roughly a dozen
labelled features (e.g.  "a white cottage", "an oak forest", "Green
Bay", etc). Most features are common to the two maps, but not all. One
map has a route drawn in, the other does not. The task is for the
participant without the route to draw one on the basis of discussion
with the participant with the route. In addition to the conversations,
each speaker provides a wordlist reading, consisting of the major
vocabulary items contained in the conversations.  All recordings were
direct to Digital Audio Tape (DAT) at 48KHz, providing very good
acoustic quality.

The experimental design allows a number of different phonemic,
syntactico-semantic and pragmatic contrasts to be explored in a
controlled way.  In particular, maps and feature names were designed
to allow for controlled exploration of phonological reductions of
various kinds in a number of different referential contexts, and to
provide, via varying patterns of matches and mis-matches between the
two maps, a range of different stimuli for referent negotiation.  Also
the conditions of the conversations were carefully balanced: In half
of them the speakers were strangers, in half friends; in half of them
the speakers could see each other's faces, in half they could not.

Subjects accommodated easily to the task and experimental setting, and
produced evidently unselfconscious and fluent speech.  The syntax is
largely clausal rather than sentential; showing good turn-taking, with
modest amounts of overlap and interruption.  The total corpus runs to
about 18 hours of speech, with the transcripts consisting of around
150,000 word tokens drawn from just over 2,000 word form types.

Transcription is at the orthographic level, quite detailed,
including filled pauses, false starts and repetitions, broken words,
etc.  Considerable care has been taken to ensure consistency of
notation, which is thoroughly documented.  Although the full
complexity of overlapped regions has not been reflected in the
transcriptions, such regions are clearly set off from the rest of the
transcripts.  Transcripts are connected to the acoustic sampled data
by sample numbers marked every few turns.

CD-ROM Contents

The waveform data are provided in "raw" (headerless) files (16-bit
samples, 20 kHz sample rate, 2 channels per conversation), and
alternative header files are provided for use with software based on
either the NIST "SPHERE" header structure or the European "SAM" header
structure.  Transcriptions are provided for each conversation, marked
up with TEI-compliant SGML, in a minimally intrusive and easily
separated way.  PostScript files of the map images used in the
experiments are provided, along with full documentation of the
experimental design and data collection protocol, resources for using
SGML tools on the transcriptions and other text materials, and an
extensive set of source code for performing basic signal processing
functions on the waveform data, such as down-sampling,
de-multiplexing, channel summation, and D/A conversion for Sun
workstations (including playback of segments selected via inspection
of transcripts in Emacs).

The CD-ROMs are in High Sierra (ISO 9660) format with the RockRidge
extensions, and are compatible with (inter alia) Unix, MS-DOS and
Macintosh operating systems.

Copies of the Map Task Corpus are available from the LDC for $200 or

Subject: RESPONSE TO QUERY: algorithms to split words into morphemes
Date: Mon, 22 Mar 1993 11:27:12 +1000

A great deal was done some 30 years ago by a Soviet
scientist, B.V. Sukhotin. He proposed, in the early 
sixties, an algorithm for breaking up a continuous
text into its constituent morphemes (properly: morphs).
I tried it in 1977 on English and on Asmat (a language
of Papua-New Guinea). Fiddling with his objective
function yielded visibly better results. No-one
was interested in such research in those days at the
university where I was, so I did not pursue it.

A translation of that particular algorithm was published
by T.A. Informations, No.2, 1973 under the title
"Algorithme de de'composition d'un texte en morphe`mes".

For the Russian original, see B.V. Sukhotin: 
Algoritmy lingvisticheskoj deshifrovki, in "Problemy
strukturnoj lingvisitki", 1963

          Program Committee
          =================

          The international program committee will consist of
          approximately 40 members from all main fields of AI and
          from Cognitive Science.



          We invite researchers from the various areas of Artificial
          Intelligence, Cognitive Science and Pattern Recognition,
          including Vision, Learning, Knowledge Representation and
          Foundations, to submit articles which assess or review the
          progress made so far in their respective areas, as well as
          the relevance of that progress to the whole enterprise of
          AI. Other papers which do not address the theme are also
          invited.


          Feature
          =======

          Four 70 minute invited talks and five panel discussions are
          devoted to the chosen topic: "Are we moving ahead: Lessons
          from Computer Vision." The speakers include (in
          alphabetical order)

                   * Lev  Goldfarb
                   * Stephen  Grossberg
                   * Robert  Haralick
                   * Tomaso  Poggio

          Such a concentrated analysis of the area will be undertaken
          for the first time.  We feel that the "Lessons from Computer
          Vision" are of relevance to the entire AI community.

Call for Participation

The American Society for Information Science Special Interest Group on
Classification Research (ASIS SIG/CR) invites submissions for the 4th ASIS
Classification Research Workshop, to be held at the 56th Annual Meeting of
ASIS in Columbus, Ohio. The workshop will take place Sunday, October 24th,
1993, 8:30 a.m. -5:00 p.m. ASIS '93 continues through Thursday, October
28th.

The CR Workshop is designed to be an exchange of ideas among active
researchers with interests in the creation, development, management,
representation, display, comparison, compatibility, theory, and application
of classification schemes. Emphasis will be on semantic classification, in
contrast to statistically based schemes. Topics include, but are not
limited to:

* Warrant for concepts in classification schemes * Concept acquisition *
Basis for semantic classes * Automated techniques to assist in creating
classification schemes * Statistical techniques used for developing
explicit semantic classes * Relations and their properties * Inheritance
and subsumption * Knowledge representation schemes * Classification
algorithms * Procedural knowledge in classification schemes * Reasoning
with classification schemes * Software for management of classification
schemes * Interfaces for displaying classification schemes * Data
structures and programming languages for classification schemes * Image
classification * Comparison and compatibility between classification
schemes * Applications such as subject analysis, natural language
understanding, information retrieval, expert systems *

The CR Workshop welcomes submissions from various disciplines. Those
interested in participating are invited to submit a short (1-2 page single-
spaced) position paper summarizing substantive work that has been conducted
in the above areas or other areas related to semantic classification
schemes, and a statement briefly outlining the reason for wanting to
participate in the workshop. Submissions may include background papers as
attachments. Participation will be of two kinds: presenter and regular

   EAST-WEST AI CONFERENCE: from theory to practice - EWAIC'93

                   Moscow, September 7-9, 1993

   The major aims of the  "East-West Conference on  Artificial
   Intelligence :  From Theory to Practice"  are to  provide a
   forum for the exchange of ideas between Eastern and Western
   scientists  regarding  the current  state-of-the-art of the
   field of Artificial Intelligence and its applications.

   The main  goal of  the  conference is to identify and study
   the relation between theory and practice. Authors are invi-
   ted to submit papers on all areas included  in  or  related
   to  Artificial Intelligence.  However,  preference  will be
   given  to papers  that contain  solid  theoretical  results
   directly leading to valuable practical applications.

   The Technical Programme will include invited talks, presen-
   tations, short talks, posters and demonstrations.


  Paper Submission Information

   Researchers are invited  to submit one copy of  an extended
   abstract (about  1500 words plus  references  on a separate
   page) describing their research. The abstract may report on
   original work  leading to  substantial practical results or
   ongoing research.  Extended  abstracts  will be reviewed by
   at least  two  referees  in order  to assess   originality,
   relevance and quality of the presentation.Both regular pre-
   sentations and  poster  sessions  will be held according to
   the quality of the retained papers.

   One page of references and the  cover page should be added.
   The cover page  includes the title of the paper , the name,
   affiliation,  mailing address,  phone and fax  number,  and
   e-mail of each author, a short abstract (200 words) and the
   specific field addressed by the paper (up to five key words).

   All the  accepted  extended abstracts will be  published in
   the  Conference  proceedings that will be distributed at the
   conference. Papers must be written in English, which is the
   working language of the Conference. We plan to publish long
   papers from the best contributions in a book after the con-
   ference.

   Please, send your submissions to either one of the  Program
   co-chairs or the  Scientific Secretary.  Submissions  would
   preferably be send by e-mail (ascii text). However, if this
   channel is not available , send your submission on a floppy
   disk to P.Brusilovsky (East side) or P.Brezillon (West side).

Standards for Multimedia Materials in  Language Education

Workshop of the European MELODI Project Group
University of Glasgow Language Centre
15-17 April 1993

This Workshop will focus on the research and development work of the
European MELODI Project (Multimedia Language Object Definition and
Implementation Project).  The MELODI Group was formed after the 1991
Strasbourg Conference of CERCLES (the Confdration europenne des centres
de languages dans l'enseignement suprieur). The group now comprises
researchers from the Universities of Glasgow and Plymouth (UK), Antwerp (B)
and Pisa (I), and beta testers from Bologna (I).
  
A  prototype hardware system for MELODI  was demonstrated at the 1992
Bordeaux CERCLES conference. Teams were later formed at Antwerp to prepare
suitable analyses of sample materials in English, Dutch, Italian, French and
Spanish.  German is to be added by 1994.  A pilot multimedia teaching
laboratory will be fully operational at the Workshop together with a range
of tools for creating multimedia learning materials. Expert technical
assistance will be provided for delegates' experimental work.

Those with an active interest in resolving the linguistic and technological
issues raised by multimedia in language education will be able to get
hands-on experience of using leading edge technology.  MELODI experience
will enable some delegates to consider joining the Project as beta testers.
Places at the workshop are strictly limited, however, and early registration
is advisable.

Tutorials for IJCNN'93-NAGOYA will be held on Monday, October 25,
1993.  Each tutorial will be three hours long. The tutorials should
be designed as such and not as expanded talks. They should lead the
student at the college Senior level through a pedagogically
understandable development of the subject matter.  Experts in neural
networks and related fields are encouraged to submit proposed topics
for tutorials.

INDUSTRY FORUM INCLUDE:

Guido J. Deboeck
Robert Heckt-Nielsen
Toshirou Fujiwara
Tsuneharu Nitta

A major industry forum will be held in the afternoon on Tuesday,
October 26, 1993.  Speakers will include representatives from
industry, government, and academia.  The aim of the forum is to permit
attendees to understand more fully possible industrial applications of
neural networks, discuss problems that have arisen in industrial
applications, and to delineate new areas of research and development
of neural network applications.


EXHIBIT INFORMATION:

Exhibitors are encouraged to present the latest innovations in neural
networks, including electronic and optical neuro computers, fuzzy
neural networks, neural network VLSI chips and development systems,
neural network design and simulation tools, software systems, and
application demonstration systems. A large group of vendors and
participants from academia, industry and government are expected.  We
believe that the IJCNN'93-NAGOYA will be the neural network largest
conference and trade-show in Japan, in which to exhibit your products.
Potential exhibitors should plan to sign up before April 30, 1993 for
exhibit booths since exhibit space is limited. Vendors may contact the
IJCNN'93-NAGOYA Secretariat.

NAGOYA:

The City of Nagoya, with a population of over two million, is the
principal city of central Japan and lies at the heart of one of the
three leading areas of the country.  The area in and around the city
contains a large number of high-tech industries with names known
worldwide, such as Toyota, Mitsubishi, Honda, Sony and Brother.  The
city's central location gives it excellent road and rail links to the
rest of the country; there exist direct air services to 18 other
cities in Japan and 26 cities abroad.

Nagoya enjoys a temperate climate and agriculture flourishes on the
fertile plain surrounding the city.  The area has a long history;
Nagoya is the birth place of two of Japan's greatest heroes: the Lords
Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who did much to bring the
'Warring States' period to an end.  Tokugawa Ieyasu who completed the
task and established the Edo period was also born in the area. Nagoya
is flourished under the benevolent rule of this lord and his
descendants


Climate and Clothing

The climate in Nagoya in the late October is usually agreeable and
stable, with an average temperature of 16-23 C(60-74 F).  Heavy
clothing is not necessary, however, a light sweater is recommended.
Business suit as well as casual clothing is appropriate.

 The Center for Cognitive Science of the State University of New York at
 Buffalo  will  present  a  four-week summer institute, July 5-30, 1994.
 This project  represents  an  important  innovation  in  the  Cognitive
 Science field; no venture of this type has been attempted before.

 The first three weeks of the Institute will be comprised of courses  at
 basic  and  advanced  levels  in  constituent  disciplines of Cognitive
 Science.  Courses will be taught  by  both  SUNY  Buffalo  faculty  and
 faculty  invited from other institutions.  The fourth week will then be
 devoted to workshops and special conferences.  Running through the four
 weeks, there will also be a special speaker series of prominent invited
 scholars.  The Institute will provide an opportunity for  many  faculty
 and  students  to get an introduction to the field of cognitive science
 and to complement courses  in  their  own  disciplines  at  their  home
 institutions.

 It is anticipated that  participants  will  include  undergraduate  and
 graduate  students,  faculty  associates, and researchers from industry
 and government.  A special effort will be made to recruit students  and
 participants  from  outside the United States, where systematic courses
 across the range of Cognitive Science disciplines are  rarely  offered.
 Participants may enroll in the courses for academic credit, if desired.
 Each course will meet for a total of 15 hours over the three weeks  and
 will carry 1 semester unit of credit.


              TENTATIVE LIST OF COURSES (as of March 1993):

                    Foundations of Cognitive Science

Subject: Announcement:  New Era for the NL-KR Digest
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 11:39:48 -0400

The NL-KR Digest is entering a new era.  The speed of electronic 
dissemination of information makes this medium ideal for announcements
and other news, but also for scholarly discussion and review.  The NL-KR
Digest will be evolving along those lines with the goal of becoming a
viable, citable, electronic journal.

This evolution will be a slow one, many of the changes will be fairly
transparent to the normal NL-KR readers.  The first step has already
been taken.

The NL-KR Digest now has an editorial board who will share the load
of moderating the Digest.  Our first goal will be to insure that the Digest
is regular and timely; where previously it was dependent on one
person's volunteer efforts, it is now shared by four volunteers who
are committed to turning this Digest into a reliable and useful source
of information.  Beginning with volume 11 of the digest (of which this
is the 5th issue), this editorial board has already begun its work,
and the transition was so smooth it was hardly noticeable.

The new NL-KR editorial board consists of:

Terry Gaasterland (gaasterland@mcs.anl.gov).  Terry is currently an
  Enrico Fermi Postdoctoral Fellow at Argonne National Laboratory in
  Illinois.  She is pursuing work in intelligent and cooperative methods 
  to handle database and logic program queries.  Her work involves 
  natural language generation, semantic query optimization, and 
  representation of knowledge domains in logic.  Her interests
  in crosslinguistic issues, logic, and computer science merged in
  her Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Generating Cooperative Answers for 
  Deductive Databases" at the University of Maryland, College Park.  

Tony McEnery (mcenery@computing.lancaster.ac.uk).  Tony is the
  Research Development Officer at the Unit for Computer Research on the
  English Language (UCREL) at the department of linguistics at Lancaster
  University, U.K. His research interests include computational
  linguistics and corpus linguistics. He has published books in the
  areas of computational linguistics and information retreival.

Al Whaley (Al.Whaley@sunnyside.com).  Al is president of Sunnyside
  Computing, Inc.  Sunnyside's primary business is custom
  implementations of large file and database systems and high speed
  random access retrieval systems, usually for terabyte and larger data
  stores requiring crash immunity.  Al's background is primarily in
  systems, i.e. operating systems, high speed networking, chip design,
  etc.  His interests in artificial intelligence are in knowledge
  representation and reasoning, which he intends to make an increasing
  part of his research activity.  He holds a Ph.D. from the University
  of Illinois, Urbana.  He also operates cpsr.org (internet site of
  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility).

Chris Welty (weltyc@cs.rpi.edu).  Chris is the Assistant Director of
  the RPI Computer Science Labs, and the former moderator of the NL-KR
  Digest.  Currently working part-time on a PhD in applying KR to
  Software Engineering, he has background in operating systems and
  networking as well as the two fields his research involves.  He has
  spearheaded the efforts of ACM SIGART to establish an electronic
  information service for AI, and as a member of the ACM Electronic
  Community Strategic Initiatives Task Force seeks to broaden the impact
  of the electronic medium in general.  Chris also serves as 
  Announcements Editor for the (old-fashioned) paper version of the
  SIGART Bulletin.

If you have any comments or suggestions about the direction you would
like to see the NL-KR Digest take, let us know.  The NL-KR Digest
archives have moved to ftp.cs.rpi.edu (from archive.cs.rpi.edu) and
are also available through gopher to cs.rpi.edu (port 70).

Subject: Query: How do you choose your KR paradigm?

Reply-To: anant@cse.iitb.ernet.in 


I have been designing and developing Expert Systems in the Indian
market for the last 6 years. In the process, it became apparent that
the choice of a tool (and in turn the representation and reasoning
paradigm) is based on a little informal analysis of the knowledge
domain combined with heuristics (& guesswork) of the developer. This
has also been acknowledged by a number of AI scientists, for example,
Larry Wos in his book "Automated Reasoning : 33 Basic Research
Problems",(Prentice-Hall, New Jersey, 1988) lists it as the 23rd
problem.  

I am investigating (formally) the process of selecting the
Representation (Logic, Rule-based, Frame-based, SN, etc.) and
Reasoning (resolution, non-monotonic reasoning, uncertain reasoning,
etc.) paradigm for a chosen domain/problem in the hope of making it
less arbitrary (are certain paradigms more appropriate in certain
domains that others and why).

Any help, pointers to existing work and/or publications would be
appreciated. 

Thanks and regards,

C. Anantaram

        INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES
                 EARLY PROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT

Quebec-city, Canada,          August  4-7 1993

Sponsored by: Paramax, A Unisys Company, NSERC and Laval University (Canada),
             Butterworth Heinemann (UK)
In cooperation with: AAAI, ACM (SIGART), CEFRIO, CRIM, GIRICO, CSSCI

Over the past 25 years, researchers have proposed several approaches for
modelling knowledge in KBS, including several kinds of formalisms: semantic
networks, frames, logics, etc. In the early eighties, John F. Sowa intoduced
the Conceptual Graph (CG) theory which provides a knowledge representation
framework consisting of a form of logic with a graph notation and integrating
several features from semantic net and frame  representations. Since that
time, several research teams over the world have been working on the
application  and on the extension of CG theory in various domains ranging
from natural language processing to data base modelling and machine learning.
This international conference follows a series of seven annual workshops
 and aims at providing an active forum for researchers and practitioners
to exchange ideas about the theory and application of conceptual graphs.

Invited Speakers:
Heterogeneous logic: reasoning with diagrams and sentences: J. Barwise, USA
Representation, discourse, logic and truth: situating knowledge technology:
             B. Gaines (Canada)
Knowledge Interchange Format: M. Genesereth (USA)
Relating diagrams to logic: J. F. Sowa (USA).

ANTHROPOMORPHIC SYSTEMS OF AUTOMATIC SPEECH
RECOGNITION AND SYNTHESIS (ASRS' 93)                    


St. Petersburg, Russia    

June 30-July 2                                                              

                                                                               

At present a lot of organizations invest considerable amounts of
money, know-how and effort to solve problems of speech
recognition and synthesis by machine. It is stimulated by practical
requirements, and scientific research has been concentrated on the
optimal solutions in the domain of speech technology systems.   

                                                

The peculiarity of the present situation is that most systems of
speech recognition and synthesis are being built around
mathematical theories of signal processing and do not involve our
knowledge of actual processes taking place in the acts of speech
production and perception.  Speech technology has reached its
major breakthrough in speech recognition systems via application
of dynamic programming and hidden Markov models, and in
speech synthesis - using large basic units such as diphones and
allophones. Further success has been stimulated by an increasing
computing power of the hardware being used.                       


Most existing applied systems are, generally speaking, far from
real biological, neural and psychophysiological systems.  The
designers of applied systems are not inclined to reach resemblance
between the functioning of their systems and that of human beings.
         

We believe that the knowledge about a human being might be
helpful for the improvement of the automatic understanding of
human speech and enhancement of synthesis-by-rule systems,
taking into account the following arguments:
                                                                

       -      At present basic knowledge and the results of
              research of human speaking behaviour are
              considered as an important resource for the progress
              of automatic speech recognition, understanding of
              spoken language and synthesis-by-rule;              

                                                              

       -      The users who order a speech technology system
              usually formulate their requirements only in terms
              of speech communicative behaviour;

       -      It is necessary to take into account the fact, that the
              result of a project in speech technology is oriented
              towards involvement of a human user in any case;
              thus the knowledge of his communicative behaviour
              should be incorporated in an automatic device.    

                                                    

The Organizers of the proposed symposium invite scientists in all
fields of research to participate in discussions and to work out
solutions to the problems that are facing them in the domain of
anthropomorphic models and systems.                                 

                                                                               

          We propose the following topics of our meeting:          

          

          1.  Speech processing in biological systems.            

          2.  Perspectives for the  development  of
              anthropomorphic  systems.   

          3.  Role of research in speech science for the
              development of speech technologies.
          4.  Types of knowledge that can be implemented in
              speech processing systems.                            

          5.  Methodological problems of experimental research
              of speech communicative process (using natural vs.
              laboratory - simulated speaking behaviour and
              signals). 

          6.  Important features of human user behaviour that are
              being developed in the process of speech
              communication between a person and a speech
              processing system.              

          7.  Role of symbol (phoneme, allophone) units in the
              processes of perception and speech generation and
              their relation to the problems of automatic speech
              synthesis and recognition.        

          8.  Organization of a lexicon and its role in a speech
              process.       

          9.  Organization of a word processor and a linguistic
              knowledge base of various levels.
         10.  User requirements to psychologically comfortable
              conditions of operations with a speech interface.

because our symposium will be held there.  It is also possible to
book three-, four- or five-stars hotels.  Prices range from 60 USD
for single room in the hotel of the Educational Center to 240-285 USD
in a five-star hotel.

A colleague is doing some psycholinguistic research and needs some bitmaps of
orthographic symbols from asian languages, especially Thai.

Can anyone help us to locate these sorts of things?

                       KR'94 - CALL FOR PAPERS 

                  FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                            PRINCIPLES OF
                KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING
                                   
              Gustav Stresemann Institut, Bonn, Germany
                           May 24-27, 1994
            with support from Gesellschaft fuer Informatik

Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by inference
algorithms provide an important foundation for much work in Artificial
Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems, and a growing
number of researchers study the principles governing systems based on
such representations and reasoning.  The KR conferences bring together
these researchers in a more intimate setting than that of general AI
conferences, and provide authors with the opportunity to give
presentations of adequate length to present substantial results.
This year's conference will take place in Europe for the first time.

The conference emphasizes both the theoretical principles of knowledge
representation and reasoning and the relationships between these
principles and their embodiments in working systems.  Authors are
encouraged to relate their work to at least one of the following
questions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real
    problems, and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation
    and reasoning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge
    representation systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding
    approaches in other parts of AI (natural language, robotics, etc.)
    or in other fields (psychology, philosophy, logic, economics,
    cognitive science, computer science, management, engineering, etc.)  

Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:

REPRESENTATIONAL FORMALISMS            REASONING METHODS AND TASKS
- logics of knowledge and belief       - deduction
- nonmonotonic logics                  - abduction

- spatial logics                       - deliberation and decision analysis
- taxonomic logics                     - planning and plan analysis 
- logics of uncertainty                - learning
  and evidence                         - diagnosis
- logics of preference and utility     - classification

                         SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The Program Committee will review EXTENDED ABSTRACTS rather than
complete papers.  Abstracts must be at most twelve (12) pages with a
maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article-style, 12pt), excluding the title
page and the bibliography.  Overlength submissions will be rejected
without review.  All abstracts must be submitted on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4
paper, and printed or typed in 12-point font (10 characters/inch on a
typewriter).  Dot matrix printout, FAX, or electronic submission will
not be accepted.  Each submission should include the names and
complete addresses (including email, when possible) of all authors.
Correspondence will be sent to the first author, unless otherwise
indicated.  Also, authors should indicate under the title which of the
questions and/or topic areas listed above best describes their paper
(if none is appropriate, please give a set of keywords that best
describe the topic of the paper).  To be considered, five (5) paper
copies of the extended abstract must be received by one of the program
co-chairs no later than November 8, 1993 (or must have been sent by
express courier no later than November 5).  Authors are also
STRONGLY encouraged (it is to their advantage) to submit an electronic
abstract in the form described below.  Electronic abstracts that
accurately reflect the contents of the papers will significantly aid
the reviewing process by helping direct the papers to the most
appropriate reviewers.

                         MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must be unpublished and substantively different from
papers currently under review.  Papers may be submitted after January
1, 1994 to other conferences as long as (a) the prior submission to
KR'94 is noted on those submissions and (b) the paper is withdrawn
>from the later conference if accepted by KR'94.

                         ELECTRONIC ABSTRACT

In addition to submitting the paper copies of the extended abstract,
authors should (if possible) send a short (200 word) electronic
abstract of their paper to KR94-abstracts@medg.lcs.mit.edu to aid in
the reviewing process.  In order to make use of software for
classifying papers and selecting reviewers, most of the electronic
abstract must be in plain ASCII text (no LaTeX or other formatting
commands) in the following format, separating each field from the next
with a blank line.

TITLE: <title of paper>

FIRST AUTHOR: <last name, first name>

FIRST ADDRESS: <first author address or affiliation>

COAUTHORS: <their names, if any>

OTHER ADDRESSES: <addresses or affiliations of coauthors>

CONTENT AREAS: <at most three content areas, separated by commas>

KEYWORDS: <keywords, separated by commas>

ABSTRACT: <text of the abstract>

The content areas preferably should be drawn from the topics listed
above, with other areas added only if necessary.  The keywords are to
aid the human reviewers only and may be chosen as desired.  The text
of the abstract field may include formatting commands, if desired, but
these should be omitted from all other fields.  A blank form for
electronic abstracts and an example abstract may be found at the end
of this Call.

                           REVIEW OF PAPERS

Submissions will be judged on clarity, significance, and originality.
An important criterion for acceptance is that the paper clearly
contributes to principles of representation and reasoning that are
likely to influence current and future AI practice.  Extended
abstracts should contain enough information to enable the Program
Committee to identify and evaluate the principal contribution of the
research and its importance.  It should also be clear from the
extended abstract how the work compares to related work in the field.

                             NOTIFICATION

Authors will be notified of the Program Committee's decision by
January 24, 1994.  Notification will be made by electronic mail
whenever possible.

                             FINAL PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers will be expected to submit substantially
longer full papers for the conference proceedings.  Final camera-ready
copies of the full papers will be due February 28, 1994.  Final papers
will be allowed at most twelve (12) double-column pages in the
conference proceedings (corresponding to approximately 28
article-style LaTeX pages; a style file will be provided by the
publisher).

                          PLANNING TO ATTEND

People planning to attend the conference are asked to send a note
stating their intention as early as possible to the local conference
organizer, Ms. Christine Harms (Christine.Harms@gmd.de), in order to

arithmetic, for pure thought 

FIRST AUTHOR: Frege, Gottlob

FIRST ADDRESS: Department of Mathematics, University of Jena, Germany

CONTENT AREAS: logics, deduction

KEYWORDS: ideography, conceptual content, inferential sequence,

ABSTRACT: I present an ideography to provide the most reliable test of
the validity of a chain of inferences, one that points out every
presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed, so that its origin
can be investigated.  I am confident that my ideography can be
successfully used wherever special value must be placed on the
validity of proofs, as for example when the foundations of the
differential and integral calculus are established.

SECOND SGAICO SUMMER SCHOOL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

2-6 August and 9-13 August 1993, IDSIA, Lugano, Switzerland

To be held at the Istituto Dalle Molle di Studi sull'Intelligenza
Artificiale (IDSIA) in Lugano, Switzerland.

Organised by IDSIA with the collaboration of the Scuola Tecnico
Superiore, Lugano Trevano and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale,
Lausanne. 

Sponsored by 
Swiss Group for AI and Cognitive Science (SGAICO)
Federal Office for Education and Science

Invited Lecturers include

Dean Allemang (EPFL)
Anne Keuneke  (University of California at Chico)
Norbert Fuchs (Institut fur Informatik, University of Zurich)

OVERVIEW

The second School comprises two fully supervised, one-week courses on
general principles of AI in the fields respectively of Language and
Reasoning, and Machine Learning.  The courses are aimed at practicing
computer professionals, as well as students of computer science, who
wish to achieve a high level of familiarity with AI techniques in
these areas.  Although the courses are intended to complement each
other, each is self-contained, and participants may register for
either or both.  A novel aspect of the School is to offer participants
extensive online experience using the Portable AI Lab, an integrated
toolkit that brings a number of mature AI methods and tools together
in a homogeneous software environment.  The system, developed by the
participating institutions, is designed to provide a useful level of
practical experience with AI problem solving after a minimal initial
period of familiarization.  The Portable AI Lab was awarded a
Technologiestandort Schweiz prize for innovation in technology for
1992. 


REGISTRATION FEES AND ACCOMMODATION

Basic fees, per five-day course, are Sfr 600 for university
participants and Sfr 1200 for industrial participants. Discounts apply
for early registration and SGAICO membership. Low-cost student-style
accommodation is available. In addition, a number of studentships are
to be made available by SGAICO for full-time student participants.

Subject: AAAI Spring Symposium Series 1994 Call for Proposals
Reply-To: skalsky@org.aaai
Date: Tue, 4 May 93 11:31:56 PDT

1994 Spring Symposium Series
Call for Proposals

AAAI invites proposals for the 1994 Spring Symposium Series, to be held 
at Stanford University, March 21-23, 1994. 

The Spring Symposium Series is a yearly set of symposia, designed to 
bring colleagues together in small, intimate forums. There will be about 
eight symposia on various topics in the 1994 Spring Symposium Series. 
All symposia will be limited in size. The symposia will run in parallel for 
two and one-half days.

The symposia will allow for presentation of speculative work and work in 
progress, as well as completed work. Ample discussion time will be 
scheduled in each symposium. Working notes will be prepared, and 
distributed to the participants. Chairs can determine whether the working 
notes of their symposia will be available as AAAI Technical Reports 
following the meeting. 

Most participants of the symposia will be selected on the basis of 
statements of interest or abstracts submitted to the symposia chairs; some 
open registration will be allowed. Participants will be expected to attend a 
single symposium.
Proposals for symposia should be between two and five pages in length, 
and should contain: 
  - A title for the symposium
  - A description of the symposium, identifying specific areas of interest
  - Evidence that the symposium is of interest at this time--such as a 
    completed, successful one-day workshop on a related topic
  - The names and addresses of the organizing committee, preferably three 
    or four people at different sites, all of whom have agreed to serve on the 
    committee
  - A list of several potential participants.

Ideally, the entire organizing committee should collaborate in producing 
the proposal. If possible, a draft proposal should be sent out to a few of the 
potential participants and their comments solicited.

All proposals will be reviewed by the AAAI Symposium Committee 
(cochairs: Lynn Andrea Stein, MIT; and Jim Hendler, University of 
Maryland). The criteria for acceptance of proposals include:
  - An appropriate level of perceived interest in the topic of the symposium 
among AAAI members. (Symposia proposals that appear to be too popular 
to fit in the size constraints should be turned into regular AAAI 
workshops.)
  - No long-term ongoing series of activities in the particular topic. (The 
Spring Symposium Series serves more to nurture interest in particular 
topics than to maintain it over a number of years.) The existence of 
activities in related and more-general topics will help to indicate the level 
of interest in the particular topic. 
  - An appropriate organizing committee.
  - Accepted proposals will be distributed as widely as possible over the 
subfields of AI, and balanced between theoretical and applied topics. 
Symposia bridging theory and practice are particularly solicited.

Symposium proposals should be submitted as soon as possible, but no 
later than June 7, 1993. Proposals that are submitted significantly before 
this deadline can be in draft form. Comments on how to improve and 
complete the proposal will be returned to the submitter in time for 
revisions to be made before the deadline. Notifications of acceptance or 
rejection will be sent to submitters around June 21, 1993. The submitters 
of accepted proposals will become the chair of the symposium, unless 
alternative arrangements are made.

The symposium organizing committees will be responsible for:
  - Producing, in conjunction with the general chair, a Call for Participation 
    for the symposium, which will be published in the AI Magazine
  - Reviewing requests to participate in the symposium and 
    determining symposium participants
  - Preparing working notes for the symposium
  - Scheduling the activities of the symposium
  - Preparing a short review of the symposium, to be printed in the AI 
    Magazine. 

AAAI will provide logistical support, will take care of all local 
arrangements, and will arrange for reproducing and distributing the 
working notes.


Please submit (preferably by electronic mail) your symposium proposals, 
and inquiries concerning symposia, to both of the chairs:

descriptions of the symposia. Please send your submissions directly to the 
address given in the description.

DO NOT SEND submissions to AAAI. 

  - All submissions must arrive by June 4, 1993.

  - Material for inclusion in the working notes of the symposia must be 
    received by August 23, 1993.


Automated Deduction in Nonstandard Logics

A variety of nonstandard logics have been proposed in artificial 
intelligence to represent time, action, and various epistemic notions such 
as knowledge, belief, and intention. Over the past decade, a wide range of 
methods have been developed for performing deduction with modal 
logics, many-valued logics, and other nonstandard logics. Additionally, an 
array of methods utilizing concepts from nonstandard logic have been 
developed in work on nonmonotonic reasoning, abduction and belief 
revision. 

Although many nonstandard logics and associated deduction methods 
have been recently proposed, a number of shortcomings characterize the 
current state of the field.

First, there are well-understood logics for which we do not yet have 
efficient deduction methods, e.g. multiple-knower epistemic logics, many 
nonmonotonic and conditional logics.

Second, there is a need for systematic comparison among different 
deduction methods, both at the level of implementation or efficiency and 
at the level of naturalness or expressiveness for particular domains and 
applications.

Third, quantitative analyses comparing the time and space requirements of 
nonstandard deduction algorithms are rarely to be found in the literature.

Fourth, although complexity results are available for many nonstandard 
logics, we still lack a sense of how frequently worst-case results will be 
encountered in typical applications. 

Fifth, we need a convincing and well-constructed library of cases where 
these logics could be applied and where the performance of different 
deduction methods can be compared.

Finally, there are few reports of the results of building AI systems (e.g. in 
natural language processing) that make use of theorem provers for 
nonstandard logics.

These gaps are clearly related to one another in complex ways. The 
significance of worst-case results can only be gauged in the context of a 
particular application of a general proof method. Systematic comparison 
of different deduction methods must wait upon quantitative analyses of the 
various methods. Progress requires greater communication between 
theorem proving specialists and researchers in areas such as planning, 
natural language understanding and diagnosis.

The goals of the symposium are to address the various issues listed above 
and also to bring together researchers working on automated deduction in 
nonstandard logics and AI researchers interested in making use of such 
deductive systems. As indicated in the above issues, our interests include 
both theoretical concerns and the practical considerations which attach to 
particular implementations and applications (including performance 
analyses, software tools, and successful or unsuccessful case studies). In 
keeping with the nature of the symposium, we encourage position papers 
and the reporting of works in progress.

Prospective participants should submit a single page summarizing their 
research interests, and providing pointers to any relevant previous work. 
Those interested in presenting their work should instead submit an 
extended abstract (of at most ten pages) that describes the work.

The following are examples of possible topics:
  - A theorem proving method for a nonmonotonic logic of belief.
  - A system that performs deduction in a language that combines a modal 
    logic of belief with a temporal logic.
  - A description of a planner that utilizes a theorem prover for a 
    nonstandard logic.
  - Accounts of abduction and belief revision based on nonstandard logic.
  - A description of an automated reasoning tool for a non-standard logic.
  - Experimental results with implementation(s) of different deduction 
    methods for modal logics.
  - Theoretical discussions of the suitability of different logics (e.g. modal 
    versus multi-valued logics) for different tasks (e.g. belief revision and 
    natural language understanding).

        organized by the Austrian Society for Cybernetic Studies
                          in cooperation with
 Dept.of Medical Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence, Univ.of Vienna

Cybernetics - "the study of communication and control in the animal and
the machine" (N.Wiener) - has recently returned to the forefront, not
only in cyberpunk and cyberspace, but, even more important, contributing
to the consolidation of various scientific theories. Additionally, an
ever increasing number of research areas, including social and economic
theories, theoretical biology, ecology, computer science, and robotics
draw on ideas from second order cybernetics. Artificial intelligence,
evolved directly from cybernetics, has not only technological and
economic, but also important social impacts. With a marked trend 
towards interdisciplinary cooperation and global perspectives, this
important role of cybernetics is expected to be further strengthened
over the next years.

Since 1972, the biennial European Meetings on Cybernetics and Systems
Research (EMCSR) have served as a forum for discussion of converging
ideas and new aspects of different scientific disciplines. As on
previous occasions, a number of sessions providing wide coverage of the
rapid developments will be arranged, complemented with daily plenary
meetings, where eminent speakers will present latest research results.

                       KR'94 - CALL FOR PAPERS 

                  FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
                            PRINCIPLES OF
                KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING
                                   
              Gustav Stresemann Institut, Bonn, Germany
                           May 24-27, 1994
            with support from Gesellschaft fuer Informatik

Explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by inference
algorithms provide an important foundation for much work in Artificial
Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems, and a growing
number of researchers study the principles governing systems based on
such representations and reasoning.  The KR conferences bring together
these researchers in a more intimate setting than that of general AI
conferences, and provide authors with the opportunity to give
presentations of adequate length to present substantial results.
This year's conference will take place in Europe for the first time.

The conference emphasizes both the theoretical principles of knowledge
representation and reasoning and the relationships between these
principles and their embodiments in working systems.  Authors are
encouraged to relate their work to at least one of the following
questions:

(1) What issues arise in representing and using knowledge about real
    problems, and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation
    and reasoning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in implemented knowledge
    representation systems, and what practical tradeoffs arise?
(4) How do these approaches to problems relate to corresponding
    approaches in other parts of AI (natural language, robotics, etc.)
    or in other fields (psychology, philosophy, logic, economics,
    cognitive science, computer science, management, engineering, etc.)  

Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:

REPRESENTATIONAL FORMALISMS            REASONING METHODS AND TASKS
- logics of knowledge and belief       - deduction
- nonmonotonic logics                  - abduction

- spatial logics                       - deliberation and decision analysis
- taxonomic logics                     - planning and plan analysis 
- logics of uncertainty                - learning
  and evidence                         - diagnosis
- logics of preference and utility     - classification
- logics of intentions and actions     - inheritance  
- deontic logics                       - belief management and revision

- applications classes, e.g. medicine  - standards

                         SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The Program Committee will review EXTENDED ABSTRACTS rather than
complete papers.  Abstracts must be at most twelve (12) pages with a
maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article-style, 12pt), excluding the title
page and the bibliography.  Overlength submissions will be rejected
without review.  All abstracts must be submitted on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4
paper, and printed or typed in 12-point font (10 characters/inch on a
typewriter).  Dot matrix printout, FAX, or electronic submission will
not be accepted.  Each submission should include the names and
complete addresses (including email, when possible) of all authors.
Correspondence will be sent to the first author, unless otherwise
indicated.  Also, authors should indicate under the title which of the
questions and/or topic areas listed above best describes their paper
(if none is appropriate, please give a set of keywords that best
describe the topic of the paper).  To be considered, five (5) paper
copies of the extended abstract must be received by one of the program
co-chairs no later than November 8, 1993 (or must have been sent by
express courier no later than November 5).  Authors are also
STRONGLY encouraged (it is to their advantage) to submit an electronic
abstract in the form described below.  Electronic abstracts that
accurately reflect the contents of the papers will significantly aid
the reviewing process by helping direct the papers to the most
appropriate reviewers.

                         MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS

Submitted papers must be unpublished and substantively different from
papers currently under review.  Papers may be submitted after January
1, 1994 to other conferences as long as (a) the prior submission to
KR'94 is noted on those submissions and (b) the paper is withdrawn
from the later conference if accepted by KR'94.

                         ELECTRONIC ABSTRACT

In addition to submitting the paper copies of the extended abstract,
authors should (if possible) send a short (200 word) electronic
abstract of their paper to KR94-abstracts@medg.lcs.mit.edu to aid in
the reviewing process.  In order to make use of software for
classifying papers and selecting reviewers, most of the electronic
abstract must be in plain ASCII text (no LaTeX or other formatting
commands) in the following format, separating each field from the next
with a blank line.

TITLE: <title of paper>

FIRST AUTHOR: <last name, first name>

FIRST ADDRESS: <first author address or affiliation>

COAUTHORS: <their names, if any>

OTHER ADDRESSES: <addresses or affiliations of coauthors>

CONTENT AREAS: <at most three content areas, separated by commas>

KEYWORDS: <keywords, separated by commas>

ABSTRACT: <text of the abstract>

The content areas preferably should be drawn from the topics listed
above, with other areas added only if necessary.  The keywords are to
aid the human reviewers only and may be chosen as desired.  The text
of the abstract field may include formatting commands, if desired, but
these should be omitted from all other fields.  A blank form for
electronic abstracts and an example abstract may be found at the end
of this Call.

                           REVIEW OF PAPERS

Submissions will be judged on clarity, significance, and originality.
An important criterion for acceptance is that the paper clearly
contributes to principles of representation and reasoning that are
likely to influence current and future AI practice.  Extended
abstracts should contain enough information to enable the Program
Committee to identify and evaluate the principal contribution of the
research and its importance.  It should also be clear from the
extended abstract how the work compares to related work in the field.

                             NOTIFICATION

Authors will be notified of the Program Committee's decision by
January 24, 1994.  Notification will be made by electronic mail
whenever possible.

                             FINAL PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers will be expected to submit substantially
longer full papers for the conference proceedings.  Final camera-ready
copies of the full papers will be due February 28, 1994.  Final papers
will be allowed at most twelve (12) double-column pages in the
conference proceedings (corresponding to approximately 28
article-style LaTeX pages; a style file will be provided by the
publisher).

                          PLANNING TO ATTEND

People planning to attend the conference are asked to send a note
stating their intention as early as possible to the local conference
organizer, Ms. Christine Harms (Christine.Harms@gmd.de), in order to
help estimate the facilities needed for the conference.  (Postal

arithmetic, for pure thought 

FIRST AUTHOR: Frege, Gottlob

FIRST ADDRESS: Department of Mathematics, University of Jena, Germany

CONTENT AREAS: logics, deduction

KEYWORDS: ideography, conceptual content, inferential sequence,

ABSTRACT: I present an ideography to provide the most reliable test of
the validity of a chain of inferences, one that points out every
presupposition that tries to sneak in unnoticed, so that its origin
can be investigated.  I am confident that my ideography can be
successfully used wherever special value must be placed on the
validity of proofs, as for example when the foundations of the
differential and integral calculus are established.

Human-Computer Collaboration
Reconciling Theory, Synthesizing Practice

This symposium deals with the theory and practice of collaborative 
problem solving between people and computers. The study of 
collaborative problem solving involves understanding the processes by 
which agents work together to achieve goals. We seek a deep 
understanding of this process as it occurs between one human and one 
computational agent, an understanding that takes into account the unique 
characteristics of each type of agent. In particular, the goals of this 
workshop are to explore the fundamental nature of collaborative problem 
solving, to examine various approaches to modeling collaboration and 
designing collaborative systems, and to draw lessons from implemented 
systems. 

We have identified three major issues that we would like submissions to 
address: (1) effectively sharing responsibility for accomplishing a task 
between a person and computer, (2) managing the interaction between a 
person and computer, and (3) clarifying assumptions concerning the 
cognitive capabilities and knowledge requirements required for effective 
collaboration. Each of these issues has a number of sub-issues which are 
listed below.

1. Sharing Responsibility
  - Analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of people and computers. 
Such analyses form the basis for distributions of responsibility between 
people and computers that maximize the effectiveness of the joint 
cognitive system.

  - Analyses of the types of communication and coordination necessary to 
collaborate on a task, such as delegating responsibility for particular 
aspects of the task, reporting results in a timely fashion, and evaluating 
results.

  - Analyses of how people do work. For example, studies that show 
people interleave problem-solving with problem-setting or that they create 
personalized workspaces to organize task-relevant objects and partial 
solutions have major implications for system design.

  - Methods for shifting responsibility between people and computers. As 
people use a system, they may detect routines in their work or patterns of 
failure and repair interactions; users should be able  to tell the system 
about such regularities and shift some of the burden for managing them to 
the system. On the other hand, as users' skills increase, they may want to 
assume greater responsibility.

2. Managing Interaction

  - Models of interaction. Two major models are intermediary and model 
world. An intermediary interface mediates between a user and an 
application, and communication occurs via linguistic description. A model 
world interface uses iconic displays and direct manipulation to give users 
the experience of direct engagement with objects in the domain of interest. 
We are interested in analyses of the conditions under which each model is 
most appropriate and ways in which they may be integrated.

  - Managing multi-media interaction. We are interested in analyses of 
which media are best for expressing particular types of information and 
techniques for coordinating the presentation of related information in 
different media. We also seek comparisons of linguistic and non-linguistic 
methods for presenting information.

  - Achieving natural communication. Issues such as managing trouble and 
controlling initiative are crucial to effective interaction, whatever 
modalities are used.

3. Clarifying Assumptions 

  - What knowledge must a system have in order to be an effective 
collaborative partner? For example, are models of a user's goals and plans 
necessary?  What about models of the task domain? 

  - What are appropriate architectures for deploying this knowledge? How 
does the debate between planned and situated accounts of activity affect 
the design of collaborative problem solving systems? 

We are interested in both theoretical arguments concerning the type of 
knowledge that is necessary to be an effective collaborative partner, and 
system-based arguments that identify types of knowledge that have proved 
useful in practice, examine the cost of acquiring, representing, and 
utilizing such knowledge, or present general architectures for collaborative 
behavior.

Those wishing to participate should submit their position paper to the 
committee chair by email. Papers that report on empirical studies of 
collaborative problem solving, theories of collaboration, and system 
architectures, implementations, and evaluations are all of interest. Papers 
should be no longer than ten pages and should be as short as possible. We 
seek papers that take clear positions, make crisp claims, even aim to provoke 
controversy, rather than simply present a description of a system, model, or 
study.

Instantiating Real-World Agents

Rather than being centered on a research area, or a general unsolved 
problem area (e.g., intelligent agents), this symposium will concentrate on 
one specific real-world problem in the hopes that progress can be made on 
at least this problem, and that a solution to this specific problem will 
provide clues to solutions to the more general problems.

This symposium will concentrate on AI as applied to a physically 
instantiated robot for vacuuming household floors.  The target problem is 
to autonomously vacuum your living room, while doing the right thing 
with furniture, pets, trash, etc.  In particular, research on navigation, 
planning, spatial representation, multi-agent control, behavior control, 
obstacle avoidance, perception, exploration, NLP interfaces, etc., will be 
of interest as long as they are related to household vacuuming.  Theoretical 
work, simulations, and implemented systems will all be of interest.  
However, work presented at this symposium should be set in the target 
domain.

Limiting the discussions to a specific task to be performed without 
allowing the engineering of a specific solution still leaves a plethora of 
issues to be explored.  We hope that significant progress can be made on 
this problem, and that new research methods might grow out of this type 
of symposia.  Perhaps most importantly, we are hopeful that a common 
problem domain may obviate the vocabulary problems that have crept up 
in recent years when researchers involved in different problems try to talk 
to one another.  By having a common problem, we hope a common 
language will emerge.

Additionally, by concentrating on a real-world problem domain, we hope 
that some practical progress can be made in this domain, and in the related 
research areas.  Robotics and planning work are too often detached from 
their application areas. It is hoped that this symposium will bring to focus 
some research areas that are of more than just academic interest. It may 
even be possible that participants in this symposium will work on a 
commercial version of this robot-- allowing them to really clean up!

Potential participants for the symposium on Instantiating Intelligent 
Agents should submit a short position paper (2 - 6 pages) that describes 
either their approach towards addressing the vacuuming problem, or their 
current research and how it can be related to the floor vacuuming problem.

Machine Learning in Computer Vision: 
What, Why, and How?

This symposium will bring together researchers from different specialties 
in machine learning and computer vision to address issues raised by 
examining the use of machine learning in computer vision:
  - What elements of a computer vision system might be learned rather 
    than hand-crafted by the designer?
  - What machine learning paradigms are appropriate to the computer 
    vision domain (especially across the signal to symbol transition)?
  - Why or how would learning improve the performance or efficiency of 
    computer vision systems?
  - How do we go about implementing or exploiting the machine learning 
    paradigms which seem most appropriate to the computer vision 
    domain?

One of the acknowledged problems with computer vision systems is that 
they tend to be hand-crafted application-specific efforts that embody or 
reflect rather little in the way of general principles which can adapt easily 
from one application environment to another. While some in the computer 
vision are currently reconsidering the goal of general purpose vision 
systems as possibly too difficult or not relevant, there is still the clearly 
motivated desire to learn something from the experience in creating a 
vision system for one application domain that can be used to make it easier 
to create the vision system.

Since much of the effort in creating a vision system often lies in creating a 
database of examples and facts, and in tuning the parameters and 
operations of the system to the application domain, learning techniques 
may be of use in addressing this problem. However, it is not yet clear what 
learning capabilities computer vision systems should have, why these 
capabilities should result in computer vision systems that display greater 
competence and generality, or how to go about building vision systems 
that incorporate learning capabilities.

>From the standpoint of machine learning systems, visual domains present 
some interesting problems. The images and outputs of low-level image 
processing operations tend to be noisy, making it difficult to get true 
segmentation of images. Thus it is unreasonable to assume that the 
transition from image signal to symbol is made completely and correctly. 
Also, large numbers of exactly labeled examples suitable for inductive 
learning are generally not available. Some domain knowledge and clear 
examples are  often available suggesting a multi-paradigm learning 
approach.

Format: The symposium will contain both invited and submitted papers. 
There will be several longer talks by invited experts and a number of short 
talks. We will emphasize an interactive discussion of issues. One panel 
will be held on the obstacles to applying learning to vision and promising 
approaches. Panel suggestions are encouraged and may be given to any 
program committee member. There will be a poster session to encourage 
broad participation and discussion. 

To present a paper or poster, submit an extended abstract of three to five 
pages by email (ascii, latex or postscript) to: hall@csee.usf.edu or 
kwb@csee.usf.edu or by hard copy to:

A new title in the Rodopi "Language and Computers - Studies in
Practical Linguistics" series is "Statistically Driven Computer
Grammars of English - the IBM/Lancaster Approach" (Black, Garside &
Leech). The book is about building computer programs that parse
sentences of "real-world" English, i.e. naturally occuring prose such
as the entire text of a morning newspaper.

The book records a five year research collaboration between IBM New
York and Lancaster University, UK. It also shows how to build and
implement a broad coverage grammar of English, supplying a grammar, a
set of algorithms for its use and guidance on corpus development.

I am curious what knowledge representation systems are publicly
available to educational/research institutions. Where can I get
them from? Are there any ftp sites? In terms of our application
requirements, we require:

- ability to store rules
- abilty to store rich semantic information in some frame-based system
- user definable operators
- user definable classes
- ease of integrating with relational databases
- language support for C, or C++, or Common Lisp, or CLOS
- compilable on ULtrix, or some standard UNIX OS.


I have considered CLASSIC that is available from AT&T Bell Labs.
Others that come to my mind are extension to KL-like systems.
However, I do not know where I can acquire them. Hence, any
pointers to where I can acquire them particularly if the software
has been used for real applications would be appreciated.

Effective processes are critical to an organization's

     - day-to-day operation,
     - medium and long-range planning,
     - marketing and sales, and 
     - product/service development and delivery. 

One key to process effectiveness is their integration, the 
degree to which the processes complement each other and work 
smoothly together.

Three communities are currently addressing the issues 
surrounding the creation and evolution of well-defined, well-
supported processes exhibiting high degrees of integration: 

     - The process support community is addressing techniques 
       and technology to assist process definition and 
       performance, with a special but non-exclusive emphasis 
       on software processes.

     - The organizational development community is addressing 
       people-related issues (communication, high-performance 
       teams, team leadership. etc.) which facilitate 
       management and collaboration.

     - The business process re-engineering community is 
       addressing approaches to re-designing and iteratively 
       improving an organization's operational, managerial 
       and planning processes. 

Each of these communities are contributing to improving an 
organization's competitive advantage through well-integrated 
processes. Each is, however, addressing different process 
aspects and different concerns within an organization. The 
prospects for process integration will be greatly improved by 
building bridges among these three "islands" of activity. 

The intent of the four-day Symposium on Process Integration 
is to initiate cross-fertilization and collaboration across 
the process support, organizational development and business 
process re-engineering communities. The Symposium's first two 
days will be devoted to presentations and panels involving 
leaders from the three communities. Discussion periods will 
allow for audience participation. The Symposium's third and 
fourth days will be devoted to half and full-day seminars and 
workshops on specific topics.

A final program and registration material will be available 
in late-Summer 1993. To receive this program and material, 
please send contact information to:

Ball, Jerry T., (1992), PM, Propositional Model, a Computational
Psycholinguistic Model of Language Comprehension Based on a Relational
Analysis of Written English, CRL, (Ph.D. Thesis) MCCS-92-226. ($20.00)

A computational psycholinguistic model of written language comprehension
called PM (Propositional Model) is described.  PM consists of two basic
components: (1) a propositional system of representation for representing
the relational structure and content of written English sentences, and (2)
a processing mechanism for constructing propositional representations
directly from written English input.  PM is a highly interactive model.
Written English text is processed directly into propositional
representations.  There is no separate syntactic analysis and no distinctly
syntactic representations exist.  The processing mechanism is lexically
driven and most knowledge of language is assumed to be encoded in the
lexicon.  Of particular importance is the information encoded by relational
lexical items.  That information sets up expectations which drive the
processing mechanism.  It also determines the possible propositional
structures.  Following the description of the system of representation and
processing mechanism, the results of two experiments which provide support
for highly interactive models of language comprehension like PM and argue
against autonomous models are presented.  The dissertation concludes with a
discussion of PM's contributions to the study of language processing.
Important influences on the development of PM have been Y.  Wilks
(Preference Semantics), R. Langacker and G. Lakoff (Cognitive Linguistics),
T. Givon (Functional-Typological Grammar), W.  Kintsch and J.  R. Anderson
(Propositional Representations), G. A. Miller and P.  Johnson-Laird
(Lexical Semantics), and P. Johnson-Laird (Mental Models).

Some issues in applying connectionism to reasoning and natural
language understanding are explored.  They center on systematicity and 
structure-sensitivity, two notions that are central to Fodor and
Pylyshyn's critique of connectionism.  Certain neglected but crucial
aspects of these notions make them more troublesome for connectionism
than has been previously acknowledged.  First, connectionism must
provide a way of embedding reasoning within certain types of context.
For instance, a system must be able to reason within the context of
another agent's beliefs.  Secondly, connectionism must provide a way
of matching two structured representations in working memory, as
opposed to merely associating working-memory items to long-term
memories.  Thirdly, there may be variables within working memory
representations, not just within long-term rules. These three points
lead to significant systematicity and structure-sensitivity
requirements over and above those that have already been discussed 
in the connectionism/symbolicism debate.  The paper is, nevertheless, 
generally sympathetic to connectionism, and its intent is to clear 
the way for further advances within that field.



Ball, Jerry T., (1992), PM, Propositional Model, a Computational
Psycholinguistic Model of Language Comprehension Based on a Relational
Analysis of Written English   (Summary Paper), CRL, MCCS-92-229. ($7.00)

A computational psycholinguistic model of written language comprehension
called PM (Propositional Model) is described.  PM consists of two basic
components: (1) a propositional system of representation for representing
the relational structure and content of written English sentences, and (2)
a processing mechanism for constructing propositional representations
directly from written English input.  PM is a highly interactive model.
Written English text is processed directly into propositional
representations.  There is no separate syntactic analysis and no distinctly
syntactic representations exist.  The processing mechanism is lexically
driven and most knowledge of language is assumed to be encoded in the
lexicon.  Of particular importance is the information encoded by relational
lexical items.  That information sets up expectations which drive the
processing mechanism.  It also determines the possible propositional
structures.  After describing PM, the use of PM for computerized NLP is
considered.  A brief comparison of PM with compatible linguistic approaches
follows.  Finally, two experiments which support the interactive nature of
PM are presented.  Important influences on the development of PM have been
Y.  Wilks (Preference Semantics), R. Langacker and G. Lakoff (Cognitive
Linguistics), T. Givon (Functional-Typological Grammar), W. Kintsch and J.
R. Anderson (Propositional Representations), G. A. Miller and P.
Johnson-Laird (Lexical Semantics), and P.  Johnson-Laird (Mental Models).



Barnden, John A., (1992), Beliefs, Connectionism, Meta-Representation,
Vagueness:  Stirring the Pot, CRL, MCCS-92-230. ($5.00)

I discuss two separate topics in the area of propositional attitude
representation.  One is the question of how to treat vague
quantification (viz.  {\it most}, {\it several}, and so on) within
propositional attitude contexts, as for example when someone says
``John believes that most of his toenails are ingrown.''  I report
some initial considerations on this issue. The intention is to fill in
a lacuna in propositional attitude research, which has been too
narrowly concerned with strict universal and existential
quantification.  The other topic is to do with the representation of
attitudes in non-implementational connectionist systems.  It throws
some light on attitude representation issues as well as on
connectionism.  One prominent way of representing attitudes is by
means of meta-logics, including quotational logics.  Meta-logic
provides some of the most expressively powerful attitude
representation approaches.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties in
importing its central ideas into non-implementational connectionist
systems.  I suggest that some of the difficulties are removed by
meta-linguistic attitude representation proposals.  These have terms
denoting natural language sentences or utterances.  An independent
reason for considering such approaches is that they are strongly
related to a prevalent commonsense metaphor of attitudes, namely the
model of beliefs and so on as internal, natural language utterances.
The discussion of the second topic reveals that connectionist concerns
with representation have been insufficiently general, in failing to
address the need for a cognitive system to be able to think about
complex structured expressions, as opposed to thinking with them.


Iverson, Eric and Helmreich, Stephen, (1992), Metallel: An Integrated
Approach to Non-literal Phrase Interpretation, CRL, MCCS-92-231. ($5.00)

Metallel is a program that incorporates marker passing techniques
within a preference/collative semantics framework.  This allows for
the simultaneous generation of literal and non-literal meaning
representations, while allowing for a much greater degree of
parallelism during processing.  In addition, we have integrated
metonymic and metaphoric inferencing into one procedure, arguing that
at least some types of metaphor can be represented as parallel
metonymies.  A number of examples are presented which show that
metallel's output is roughly equivalent to conventional, rule-based
approaches to metonymy.


Barnden, John A., 1992, On Using Analogy to Reconcile Connections and
Symbols, CRL, MCCS-92-232. ($7.00)

How do we gain both standard advantages of connectionism and those of
symbolic systems, without adopting hybrid symbolic/connectionist
systems?  Fully connectionist systems that support analogy-based
reasoning are proposed as an answer, at least in the realm of
high-level cognitive processing.  This domain includes commonsense
reasoning and the semantic/pragmatic aspects of natural language
processing.  The proposed type of system, purely by being
analogy-based, gains forms of graceful degradation, representation
completion, similarity-based generalization, learning, rule-emergence
and exception-emergence.  The system therefore gains advantages
commonly associated with connectionism, although the precise forms of
the benefits are different.  At the same time, through being fully
connectionist, the system also gains the traditional connectionist
variants of those advantages, as well as gaining further advantages
not provided by analogy-based reasoning per se.  And, because the
system is in part an implementation of a form of symbolic processing,
it preserves the flexible handling of complex, temporary structures
that are well supported in traditional artificial intelligence and
which are essential for high-level cognitive processing.  The chapter
is in part a reaction against the excessive polarization of the
connectionism/symbolicism debate.  This polarization is seen as
resulting from over-simplified, monolithic views both of what symbolic
processing encompasses and of the nature of the benefits that
connectionism provides.  



Dunning, Ted, Cowie, Jim, & Wakao, Takahiro, 1992, An Analysis of a
Parallel Japanese-English Corpus, CRL, MCCS-92-233. ($5.00)

We have analyzed a data set consisting of 10,000 paired English and
Japanese scientific abstracts.  Roughly 80% of these abstracts are
direct translations, with the remainder being summaries in Japanese of
originally English texts.  This is the first example of a parallel
corpus pairing English with any oriental language that we are familiar
with.  We show that Japanese in Extended Unix Code (EUC) is relatively
more efficient at encoding information than English in ASCII, but that
the information content of the two is similar.  We present the results
of a standard frequency analysis of the Japanese corpus alone,
including character, character bigram, word and word bigram frequency
analyses.  Further, we present the results of statistical studies
which attempt to extract a translation glossary from the paired texts
and an initial assessment of the feasibility of automatic sentence
alignment based on an analysis of 100 texts whose sentences were
aligned manually.

Jin, Wanying, 1992, A Case Study: Chinese Segmentation and its
Disambiguation, CRL, MCCS-92-237. ($5.00)

This paper first reviews the techniques used in the current Chinese
segmentation systems. The methods include character string match,
generate-and-test approach and knowledge-based expert system approach.
A proposed algorithm for segmenting Chinese sentences in news 
articles is then presented. The basic idea is to use each character in
the input string as an index to retrieve a list of candidate words
from a Chinese lexical database, and then use the input string
as a filter to rule out all the incompatible candidates. All compatible
candidates are aligned to produce the plausible strings as hypotheses.
The difficulties in Chinese segmentation are also discussed. A
technique of reasoning under uncertainty is studied in an attempt 
of solving problems in disambiguation. Finally, a knowledge-based
plausible reasoning mechanism is proposed.

Stein, Gees C., (1993), Genus Verb Disambiguation: Possible or
Impossible, CRL, MCCS-93-240. ($5.00)

The problem of verb disambiguation is of interest to many research
projects. This paper concentrates on the disambiguation of verbs as
used in verb definitions: the genus verb.

The verb definitions in the on-line dictionary LDOCE (Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English, 1984) contain not only definition
sentences and example sentences, but also grammatical information,
pragmatic information and semantic information among others.

The algorithm developed for the genus disambiguation is based on the
definition and example sentences, the pragmatic information (in which
contexts is a word in general used, like Law, Engineering etc.) and on
semantic information (what kind of subject does a verb prefer).

The algorithm was tested on a hand-disambiguated test set of 100 verb
definitions. The disambiguation was done with respect to the
definitions as found in LDOCE.

The final results looked promising although verbs have some specific
problems. Future work has to decide whether this approach really is
useful.

Research Issues in Machine Translation at the Computing Research
Laboratory, CRL, MCCS-92-242. ($5.00) 

In this paper, several issues related to Machine Translation and the
ULTRA MT system that is currently under development at the Computing
Research Laboratory (CRL) at New Mexico State University are
presented.  ULTRA is a five-language, interlingual-based system
(English, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Japanese).  Its theoretical
goals lie in the area of pragmatics and communication, though to date
this aspect has been implemented in only a limited manner.

This paper emphasizes on issues which are particularly pertinent to
interlingual systems and to those based on communicative principles.
The approach to each of these issues within the ULTRA system and some
of the ancillary tools to assist in the process of MT-system research
are described.  For example, a multi-lingual interface which supports
special character sets and a lexicon-building menu system are
described.  The current state of the ULTRA system are summarized and
future research directions are discussed.


Wilks, Yorick, First Workshop of the Consortium for Lexical Research,
1992, CRL, MCCS-92-243. ($7.00)

This document is a brief record of the presentations and
discussion at the first workshop of the Consortium for Lexical
Research (CLR), held at Las Cruces, New Mexico in January 1992. The
nature and role of the CLR is explained at the end of this document.
The workshop brought together researchers, publishers, funders and
consumers of lexical data to discuss how a range of key legal and
intellectual issues related to the functioning of the CLR.

The transcript is partial and must be viewed in that light: notes were
taken by a range of people and transcribed but, inevitably, some kept
much fuller notes than others and my editing cannot repair that, so
that the space given here to speakers is a function of the fullness of
the notes and NOT of the length of what was said. It should be born in
mind that the words ascribed to speakers are not literally their own,
and we have avoided a lengthy process of consulting them because any
editing by the speakers themselves would inevitably destroy dialogue
coherence. Hence this record will not receive any formal publication
beyond this form, and anyone who feels they have been misrepresented
must accept my apologies.

The workshop was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation and
the Association for Computational Linguistics, and many thanks are due
to the relevant officers at all three institutions.

Barnden, John & Srinivas, K., 1992, Working Memory Variables, Logical
Combinators and Systematicity, CRL, MCCS-92-245. ($5.00)

The connectionist problem of achieving the quantificational effect of
symbolic variables is well recognized.  However, one relatively
neglected issue is that of variables in working memory representations
(arising, for instance, from natural language inputs), as opposed to
variables in rules.  Working memory variables present difficulties,
centering on the arbitrariness of the set of variables used in any
given expression, and on non-uniformity in expressions and
manipulations.  However, the variables can in principle be avoided,
for instance by using logical combinators.  These are special
functions much studied within the symbol processing arena.  The use of
combinators makes structures less arbitrary and more uniform.  The
reduced arbitrariness ameliorates an important systematicity problem,
and the added uniformity could facilitate high-level parallelism.  We
do not claim that the combinator approach is definitely the right one
to adopt, because of some problems.  Nevertheless, combinators need to
be borne in mind, and the symbolic/connectionist debate has been
over-simplified in ignoring them.  We discuss several ways in which
combinator-based working memory items could be implemented in
connectionism, with special attention to reduced-representation
implementations.  We also compare the combinator approach with the
technique of using canonical sets of variables in expressions.

Dunning, Ted, 1992, NounSense - A Disambiguated Noun Taxonomy with a
Sense of Humour, CRL, MCCS-92-246. ($7.00)

The Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University is
involved in a project to create a data-base of lexical facts in the
form of a network of semantically related word senses.  The data-base
will support the automatic construction of lexicons for many types of
natural language processing systems.  In this paper we discuss
NounSense, a disambiguated IS-A hierarchy of nouns automatically
constructed from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE).  The primary focus of our presentation will be on the
techniques used to construct the network, and on its semantic readable
dictionaries in general.  Additionally we will present a brief
overview of the interface developed for NounSense, as we feel it
incorporates many features that enhance the usability of the
information in the data-base.  Finally, we will exhibit the fact that
our network does contain a sense of humor, indeed more than one, with
some interesting taxonomical relationships.


Wang, Jin and Wilks, Yorick, 1992, Protocols for Reference Sharing in
a Belief Ascription Model of Communication, CRL, MCCS-92-248. ($5.00)

The basic idea behind the \fIViewGen\fR model is that each agent
involved in a conversation has a belief space which includes models of
what other parties to the conversation believe.  The distinctive
notion is that a basic procedure, called belief ascription allows
belief spaces to be amalgamated so as to model the updating and
augmentation of belief environments. In this paper we extend the
\fIViewGen\fR model to a more general account of reference phenomena,
in particular by the notion of an ascription path (AP) that links
intensional objects across belief environments so as to locate the
most heuristically plausible referent at a given point in a
conversation.  The key notion is the location and attachment of
entities that may be under different descriptions, the consequent
updating of the system's beliefs about other agents by default, and
the role in that process of speaker's and hearer's protocols that
ensure that the choice is the appropriate one. The purpose of these
protocols is to make the models of other agent's beliefs as good a
representation as possible given the information to hand, and to make
the agent's own beliefs more accessible to the other (on the
assumption no deception is involved).  The important characteristic of
this model is that each communicator considers nothing beyond his own
belief space.


Guthrie, Louise, Guthrie, Joe, Wilks, Yorick,  Cowie, Jim, Farwell,
David, Slator, Brian, and Bruce, Rebecca, 1992, A research program on
machine-tractable dictionaries and their application to text analysis,
CRL, MCCS-92-249. ($5.00)

Machine-readable dictionaries (MRD's) contain substantial knowledge
about language and the world essential for large-scale tasks in
natural language processing (NLP), though an important empirical
question remains whether it is sufficient for such tasks. This
knowledge, however, collected and recorded by lexicographers for human
readers, is not expressed in MRD's in a form that can be used directly
as a tool for NLP tasks.  What the NLP research community needs is
machine tractable dictionaries (MTD's); that is, MRD's transformed
into a format appropriate for NLP tasks.

At CRL we have explored several large-scale computational methods for
the transformation of MRD's into MTD's, and have also developed a
range of tools for extracting information from MRD's for specific NLP
applications. We describe here a combination of these methods, based
on their respective strengths: a hybrid SPIRAL methodology that
combines elements from each of the methods (numerical and
non-numerical) into a single coherent procedure to produce an MTD or
lexical-knowledge base.  Our hope is that, although each of the
methods is incomplete in certain respects, and so a weak method in
Newell's sense, the combination of them will yield better results than
any individual method could. The chief difficulty with the MRD itself
is that the defining items in the dictionary are themselves ambiguous,
and it is this that the SPIRAL methodology seeks to overcome.

The result is an MTD that is a knowledge-base of unambiguous lexical
facts, linked by a network of semantically-related word senses.  It is
currently derived from Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE), though we are augmenting that from other MRD's such as
COBUILD.  We also describe briefly one application of the MTD to
machine translation, and the extension of the disambiguation
techniques used in construction of the MTD to large-scale
sense-tagging of general text.  The end goal of the work described
here is to develop methods for the production of larger systems faster
than can be achieved with custom-made lexicons.


Dunning, Ted and Davis, Mark, (1993), Multi-lingual Information
Retrieval, CRL, MCCS-93-252. ($5.00)

We have designed a fully multi-lingual information retrieval system
and tested crucial parts.  This system can accept a query in one
language and find documents in others.  Furthermore, relevance
feedback can be used in a fully multi-lingual fashion.

Our system is based on the availability of parallel and aligned texts.
We use these texts to derive a linear approximation of the translation
process, and then use this linear transformation to implement a
conventional vector based information retrieval system.  We describe
three possible techniques for deriving this translation matrix, one of
which we have implemented and tested on a relatively moderately sized
training corpus.  Our method appears to be very efficient in terms of
the size of the necessary training corpus.

Since our solution for the translation matrix is incremental in
nature, additional parallel texts can be used to augment the system at
any time.

Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Stone Soup and the French Room: the
empiricist-rationalist debate about machine translation, CRL,
MCCS-93-255. ($5.00)

The paper argues that the IBM statistical approach to machine
translation has done rather better after a few years than many
sceptics believed it could. However, it is neither as novel as its
proponents suggest nor is it making claims as clear and simple as they
would have us believe. The performance of the purely statistical
system (and we discuss what that phrase could mean) has not equalled
the performance of SYSTRAN. More importantly, the system is now being
shifted to a hybrid that incorporates much of the linguistic
information that it was initially claimed by IBM would not be needed
for MT. Hence, one might infer that its own proponent do not believe
"pure" statistics sufficient for MT of a usable quality. In addition
to real limits on the statistical method, there are also strong
economic limits imposed by their methodology of data gathering.
However, the paper concludes that the IBM group have done the field a
great service in pushing these methods far further than before, and by
reminding everyone of the virtues of empiricism in the field and the
need for large scale gathering of data.

NO ABSTRACT


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Language, vision and metaphor, CRL,
MCCS-93-257. ($3.00)

The integration of language and vision capabilities in computers can
be seen purely as a multi-media task without any theoretical
assumptions being required.  However, it is worth exploring whether
the modalities have anything serious in common, in particular in the
light of the claim that most non-technical language use is
metaphorical.  What consequences would that have for the underlying
relationship of language and vision: is it possible that vision is
largely metaphorical?

The conclusion is that visual processing can embody structural
ambiguity (whether compositional or not), but not anything analogous
to metaphor.  Metaphor is essentially connected with the extension of
sense and only symbols can have senses.  But if it makes no sense to
say a figure can be metaphorical (unless it embodies symbolic
elements) that must also mean, alas, that it makes no sense to say it
is literally anything either.  Only a symbol can be literally
something.  A hat is a hat is a hat, but never, ever, literally so.


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Penrose on Artificial Intelligence, CRL,
MCCS-93-258. ($3.00)

Penrose's attack on artificial intelligence (AI) will give its
practitioners less worry and discomfort than did its earlier
philosophical critics Dreyfus and Searle, answering whom busied AI-ers
for years. Penrose does not really understand his target, in the sense
of knowing first-hand the detail and variety of AI work. He seems to
have got much of his understanding of it second-hand from Searle whose
critical terminology he uses, unexamined. Moreover, some of his
arguments have already been well-rehearsed within philosophy, such as
the one about the possible relevance of Goedel's theorem to machine
intelligence.

None of this would matter if his arguments were good but they are not;
in the case of the Goedel argument he has added nothing not present in
the older version.  Penrose's only claim on our attention, apart
from his book sales, is that he is an established physicist and
mathematician, one with striking achievements to his name in topology,
cosmology and quantum theory as well as the discovery of a new
impossible object.

Abstract:

Tolerance orders and tolerance graphs arise as a generalization of
interval orders and interval graphs in which some overlap of intervals
is tolerated.  The classes of bounded, proper and unit tolerance
orders and graphs have been studied by other authors.  Our motivation
in introducing two-sided versions of these classes comes from the
problem of scheduling rooms for seminars where some overlap between
scheduled events is permitted.  We show that all the two-sided classes
are identical for bipartite ordered sets and give some examples to
show that the classes differ in the nonbipartite case.  We also give
an algorithm for determining whether a bipartite ordered set is in
these classes, and if so finding a representation of it.

Finally, we discuss variations including directed tolerance graphs and 
circular arc tolerance graphs.

This is joint work with Ken Bogart at Dartmouth College.

Hello, As part of a tutorial I'm co-presenting (at SIGIR-93 and
ACL-93, with Liz Liddy) on natural language processing for information
retrieval, I would like to prepare two brief lists:

    1. A list of "lists" of resources for natural language processing
of text.  I count electronic mailing lists, and archives of those
lists, as such lists of lists when they frequently discuss language
processing resources.  I will also list network servers (FTP archives,
Bitnet LISTSERVs, etc.) as "lists" but even better would be to be able
to provide pointers to regularly maintained files on such archives.

My current list is the following:

  Free electronic mailing lists:
    NL-KR
    IRLIST
    LINGUIST
    EMPIRICISTS
    CORPORA-LIST
    LN 
    HUMANIST

  Commercial electronic mailing lists:
    Computists Communique

  Regularly Maintained Lists of Resources:
    /pub/catalog at anonymous FTP site clr.nmsu.edu 

Suggestions are welcome. This list of "lists" is intended to be a
one-shot effort that will become immediately out-of-date, but will
have pointed a group of people to maintained resources with a longer
expected lifetime.
  
    2. A second list of the 10 to 20 most useful, easily available,
non-commercial resources for content-based processing of large (at
least megabyte scale) bodies of text, and how to get them.  (If it
takes more than 50 words to describe how to get them, they fail on
"easily available".)  I want to include only resources that are
robust, available at nominal cost (at least to academics), and have
actually been successfully used by multiple research or application
groups.  Some of the ones I intend to include on the list based on
personal experience are:

    --Treebank corpus (tagged corpus)
    --PC-Kimmo and Englex (morphological analyzer)
    --Perl (programming language) 
    --SMART (information retrieval system)
    --JUMAN (Japanese morphological analyzer / segmenter)

I welcome suggested additions to this list, from resource developers
and particularly from resource users based on your personal
experience.  Please do not be offended if you are a resource developer
and I do not choose to list your resource. Brevity is my goal and
there will be significant omissions.

    I will post the resulting two lists back to all newsgroups that
this query is going to, so there's no need to write me asking for
copies.  These two lists will be one shots that will not be
maintained, and will hopefully be soon forgotten in favor of better,
permanently maintained lists.

Many thanks, David Lewis

I) Objectifs et motivations 

    Cette action a pour objectif de demarrer une serie de seminaires sur
le Traitement du Langage Naturel (TLN) qui se tiendraient en Roumanie
 tous les deux ans. Les themes seront principalement
orientes vers le Langage Naturel mais toujours en relation avec un
autre domaine de l'Intelligence Artificielle ou des Sciences Cognitives.
Des professeurs et chercheurs reputes des pays Europeens seront invites a

V) Informations pratiques 

      Les roumains sont des gens tres chaleureux et attaches a la France.
Leur langue est d'origine latine comme le francais, qu'ils apprennent au
lycee. Les universitaires parlent, presque tous, notre langue.
      La Roumanie est un tres joli pays,  riche de merveilles
touristiques et de traditions. Iasi est une grande ville de 300 000 habitants, 
avec un aeroport, a 400 km au nord de Bucarest. Liaisons ferroviaire (train de 
nuit) et aerienne (en semaine) directe. On y trouve de grands hotels d'un 
confort comparable aux **NN en France, mais bien meilleurs marches.
      L'avion est certainement le meilleur moyen pour s'y rendre (2h. pour
atteindre Bucarest + 1h. par un vol interieur. Prevoir eventuellement 1
nuit a Bucarest a cause des horaires et du changement d'aeroport).
TAROM (compagnie nationale roumaine) offre des prix tres avantageux (de
l'ordre de 2.900 F A.R. Paris-Iasi). S'adresser a des agences specialisees
pour les pays de l'Est comme :
  
  - Voyages UTA, Paris, (1) 48.24.74.74
  - Club Vacances Modernes, Villerupt,  82.89.28.31
  - Nouvelles frontieres, Villeneuve d'Ascq, 20.47.00.04

Passeport obligatoire en cours de validite - Visa a la frontiere.
Des livres pour preparer un voyage :
  
  - Europe de l'Est, Guide Arthaud (1990)
  - Le guide du Routard, pays de l'Est (92/93), Hachette.

  Adresses utiles :
  
    - TAROM, Paris,  (1) 47.42.27.14 / 47.42.25.42

\subsection{Transformation de programmes et interpretation 
                 abstraite pour Prolog.}
{\bf Intervenant : Philippe DEVIENNE (LIFL-CNRS, Universite de Lille 1)} \\

L'utilisation croissante des langages declaratifs a conduit la 
communaute logique a proposer
des techniques de compilation plus intelligentes et mieux adaptees a 
ce type de langages. En
effet,  une des fonctions majeures des compilateurs modernes est 
consacree a l'optimisation
du code et de la gestion memoire. Pour que ces optimisations n'affectent 
pas la semantique
des programmes, une approche formelle est necessaire pour prouver la 
correction des
transformations induites.
Dans le cadre de ces recherches, plusieurs techniques ont pu etre mises 
en avant comme apportant
de reelles ameliorations dans l'execution des programmes logiques. 
Le but de ce cours est
d'introduire sans exces de formalisme mathematique celles jugees les 
plus significatives, en particulier l'interpretation abstraite et la machine abstraite de Warren. 
L'interpretation abstraite a
pour but de detecter des points d'invariance lors de l'execution d'un 
programme, ceci en se
basant non pas sur les valeurs exactes des donnees, mais leur 
description abstraite.
La machine de Warren constitue une solide reference en matiere de 
compilation; elle est a
la base de la plupart des environnements Prolog. Parmi les autres 
methodes, il faut citer l'evaluation partielle qui 
permet, par exemple, de
nettoyer un programme logique des predicats ou symboles introduits par 
le programmeur (pour un
souci naturel de structuration et lisibilite de son programme) et le 
backtracking intelligent
qui a pour objet  d'optimiser le parcours de l'arbre de resolution en 
elaguant celui-ci de
certaines branches qui conduiraient a des echecs.
	Ces methodes formelles d'analyse statique et de compilation de 
programmes logiques sont
profondement complementaires et  apportent des gains subtantiels en 
terme
d'efficacite en temps et en espace des  environnements de programmation 
logique.

\subsection{Grammaires d'unification et traduction automatique.}
{\bf Intervenant : Dominique Estival, ISSCO, Universite de Geneve} \\

L'unification est une operation qui a donne son nom aux types de formalismes
qui l'emploient, car depuis quelques annees cette operation est devenue un
concept central, tant pour l'elaboration d'outils informatiques pour le TAL:
PATR-II, FUG, GDE, ELU, que pour la recherche en linguistique theorique:
GPSG, LFG, HPSG.
Dans ce cours, nous presenterons le formalisme de l'unification, son
application a des grammaires de Traitement Automatique du Langage Naturel (TAL) et
mettrons en evidence ses avantages pour la Traduction Automatique (TA). 
Du point de vue informatique, c'est un mecanisme qui sert a combiner
l'information.  Un de ses interets pour la linguistique reside dans le fait
que l'on peut s'en servir pour etablir des correlations entre differents
types d'information:  en particulier entre une forme linguistique et son
interpretation, entre une interpretation et sa realisation morphologique ou
phonologique, ou entre des interpretations de plusieurs formes linguistiques
differentes.  Ce n'est cependant qu'un mecanisme informatique sous-jacent
aux grammaires, et non une theorie linguistique, cognitive, ou autre.
Il offre la propriete principale d'etre {\bf declaratif}, et donc
reversible en principe, mais aussi il faut souligner {\bf l'expressivite}, {\bf l'uniformite} et sa {\bf neutralite theorique}.  
Nous examinerons en detail les questions posees par la {\em negation} et la {\em disjonction}, les {\em termes} (objets complexes) et les {\em listes} comme valeurs d'attribut, les {\em variables} pour les chemins $<$attribut valeur$>$, les {\em expressions typees}, les {\em abstractions} sur des ensembles de contraintes.

Nous montrerons les liens entre certains des concepts sur lesquels se base
le formalisme d'unification et certains des buts d'un systeme de TA.  La
recherche en TA peut en effet avoir plusieurs buts, bien que tout systeme de
TA doive au minimum accepter comme entree un texte en une langue et produire
en sortie un texte en une autre langue et supposer une certaine
correspondance entre ces deux textes.

Pour illustrer le mecanisme de l'unification et son utilisation dans un
systeme de TA, nous nous servirons de ELU (Environnement Linguistique d'Unification),
l'environnement de genie linguistique elabore a l'ISSCO, qui a deja permis
la  construction d'un systeme de traduction fran\c{c}ais-allemand.
En effet, ELU offre aux linguistes et chercheurs en TAL un
environnement qui leur fournit un formalisme theoriquement valide leur permettant
d'experimenter differentes analyses et theories linguistiques pour les
descriptions des langues.  Plus particulierement, il permet aux chercheurs en TA 
d'experimenter differentes approches de la traduction.
La declarativite du formalisme d'unification permet a une description,
a quelque niveau que ce soit, d'etre bidirectionnnelle.  Si cette
description est une grammaire, celle-ci est reversible, c'est-a-dire utilisable
aussi bien pour la comprehension (l'analyse) que pour la production (la
synthese)
En TAL, il y a tout interet a n'avoir qu'une seule grammaire
pour les deux processus, car cela apporte des avantages
considerables lors de l'elaboration d'une grammaire et pour son utilisation.
Tout d'abord, la reversibilite
permet une grande souplesse de developpement et facilite la maintenance (en
effet, les modifications ne se font qu'une seule fois!).  De maniere
peut-etre plus importante, elle impose une plus grande rigueur d'analyse et une
coherence formelle dans les traitements de phenomenes linguistiques.

L'unification offre aux chercheurs un formalisme aux proprietes simples
et mathematiquement bien definies.  En particulier, la localite des regles
et leur declarativite presentent des avantages evidents pour le TAL.  La
bidirectionnalite des grammaires qui en decoule represente pour la TA un gain
de temps et une facilite de maintenance considerables qui, allies a une rigueur
et une consistance des analyses linguistiques, en font un outil de
recherche precieux.

\subsection{Methodes Connexionnistes pour le traitement du Langage Naturel.}
{\bf Intervenants : Daniel MEMMI et Mihail CRUCIANU (LIMSI-CNRS \& Paris-Sud)} \\

Une quantite croissante de travaux connexionnistes apporte des methodes nouvelles pour le 
traitement du langage naturel. Ce cours montre comment appliquer les reseaux neuronaux a des
problemes linguistiques divers (morphologie, syntaxe, semantique). On presentera les
principaux modeles connexionnistes actuels dans ce domaine, et les resultats obtenus. On tentera
d'evaluer a la fois les avantages de ces modeles, les problemes fondamentaux que pose la
structure syntaxique du langage. Plus generalement, on posera la question des rapports entre le
connexionnisme et l'IA classique. Le cours traitera donc les sujets suivants:

\begin{itemize}
\item Principes de fonctionnement des reseaux neuronaux. Les promesses du connexionnisme
(robustesse, flou, apprentissage, ...). Representations locales et distribuees. Du neuronal au
symbolique. Le cas du langage naturel.
\item Apprentissage de regularites implicites par des reseaux en couche (ex: NETtalk).
Vraisemblance psychologique. Comparaison avec des regles symboliques explicites.
\item Desembiguation lexicale en contexte dans des reseaux recurrents (ex: Waltz \& Pollack).
Interet et limites de ces modeles. Probleme de representation de la syntaxe.
\item Apprentissage de sequences grammaticales par des reseaux boucles (ex: Elman). Extraction
de la structure implicite par analyse de donnees. Evaluation de ces modeles. 
\item Le probleme general de la compositionalite et de la structure syntaxique.
Insuffisance des reseaux neuronaux actuels. Comparaison avec l'IA symbolique. Quelques directions
de recherche. Evolution probable du domaine.
\end{itemize}


\noindent {\bf Connectionist Methods for Natural Language Processing} \\
{\bf Professors : Daniel MEMMI and  Mihail CRUCIANU (LIMSI-CNRS  \& Paris-Sud)} \\

The growing amount of connectionist research has brought new methods for natural language processing.
This tutorial shows how to apply neural networks to various linguistic problems (morphology,
syntax, semantics). We will present the main connectionist models dealing with language along with
their results. We will try to evaluate the advantages of these models, as well as the fundamental
problem of syntactic structure. More generally, one will deal with the relationship between
connectionism and classical AI. The tutorial will then cover the following topics :

\begin{itemize}
\item Principles and functioning of neural networks. The claims of connectionism : flexibility,
fuzziness, learning, ... Local and distributed representations. From neurons to symbols. The case
of natural language.

\subsection{Abduction as a unifying approach for comprehension, generation 
and machine translation.}
{\bf Intervenant : Dan TUFIS (ICI-Bucharest)} \\

The classical approach to natural language parsing and generation may be 
described as a deductive process. However, for semantic  and mainly pragmatic 
(discourse) processing, deduction offers limited posibilities for dealing with
 specific problems. In most cases one makes use of other types of inference
within non-standard logics. 

This tutorial presents an emerging technology in inference-based natural 
language processing. The abductive approach integrates the older deductive
view, offering a unifying solution for  interpretation and generation.
Translation fits nicely within the abductive approach: it is regarded as a 
matter of interpretation in the source language and generation in the target
language.

After an introduction to pure abduction, we will present weighted abduction 
and discuss a few control strategies for abductive reasoning. An intuitive 
algorithm for abductive inference will conclude the first part of this tutorial.
The rest of the lectures will exemplify the weighted abduction at work in 
interpretation, generation and translation. We will address some notorious
difficult problems in natural language processing and exemplify their abductive 
solutions: parsing ungrammatical input, reference identification, interpretation
of nominal compounds, understanding metonimies, inferring the meaning of unknown
words, detecting and repairing user misunderstandings. 
We will exemplify generation by using the same grammar as in interpretation, thus
accounting for another merit of the abductive approach: 
bidirectionality. 
A small grammar for Romanian, corresponding to the English grammar used in the
previous examples and a few abductive transfer rules, will help us to discuss 
the abductive approach to machine traslation.

Finally, provided time will be on our side, we will discuss some open questions:
admissibility of abductive solutions, weight significance, interpretation and 
assignment (statistical vs. model preferences methods), computational 
intractability and avoiding combinatorial explosion.

\subsection{Natural Language Generation : 
when the cognitive scientist meets the engineer.}
{\bf Intervenant : Michael ZOCK (LIMSI-CNRS \& Paris-Sud)} \\

Natural language generation is a field that lies at the crossroads of various disciplines: 
{\it linguistics, psychology, rhetorics, computer science} (to name just those). What is striking is
the fact that, despite its inherent interdisciplinarity, most scholars don't know about the work of
the neighbouring disciplines. 

The goal of this tutorial is twofold: (a) introduce the non-specialist to the problems and
achievements of this discipline; (b) help to bridge the gap that still exists between the experts of
the different disciplines (e.g. linguists, psychologists). The following issues will be addressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it motivation of the research}: Why is generation an important research area?
\item {\it identification of the problems}: Why is generation a difficult task?
\item {\it achievements}: What has been achieved? What methods have been invented?
\item {\it evaluation}: Which problems have been neglected?
\item {\it current issues in NL-generation}: what areas are in the current focus of interest?
\end{itemize}

The organization of the tutorial will parallel the typical order in which people proceed when
producing language: starting from a communicative goal ({\it deep generation}: determination of
content, planning of text structure) we will gradually work our way to the linguistic form
({\it surface generation}: lexical choice, syntactic structure). 

Special emphasis will be given to the fact that the problem of natural language generation can only
be solved in the realm of cognitive science, that is, within a framework where linguists,
psychologists and computer scientists agree to meet and work in concert.

Ball, Jerry T., (1992), PM, Propositional Model, a Computational
Psycholinguistic Model of Language Comprehension Based on a Relational
Analysis of Written English, CRL, (Ph.D. Thesis) MCCS-92-226. ($20.00)

A computational psycholinguistic model of written language comprehension
called PM (Propositional Model) is described.  PM consists of two basic
components: (1) a propositional system of representation for representing
the relational structure and content of written English sentences, and (2)
a processing mechanism for constructing propositional representations
directly from written English input.  PM is a highly interactive model.
Written English text is processed directly into propositional
representations.  There is no separate syntactic analysis and no distinctly
syntactic representations exist.  The processing mechanism is lexically
driven and most knowledge of language is assumed to be encoded in the
lexicon.  Of particular importance is the information encoded by relational
lexical items.  That information sets up expectations which drive the
processing mechanism.  It also determines the possible propositional
structures.  Following the description of the system of representation and
processing mechanism, the results of two experiments which provide support
for highly interactive models of language comprehension like PM and argue
against autonomous models are presented.  The dissertation concludes with a
discussion of PM's contributions to the study of language processing.
Important influences on the development of PM have been Y.  Wilks
(Preference Semantics), R. Langacker and G. Lakoff (Cognitive Linguistics),
T. Givon (Functional-Typological Grammar), W.  Kintsch and J.  R. Anderson
(Propositional Representations), G. A. Miller and P.  Johnson-Laird
(Lexical Semantics), and P. Johnson-Laird (Mental Models).


Barnden, John A., (1992), Connectionism, Structure-Sensitivity, and
Systematicity: Refining the Task Requirements, CRL, MCCS-92-227. ($7.00)

Some issues in applying connectionism to reasoning and natural
language understanding are explored.  They center on systematicity and 
structure-sensitivity, two notions that are central to Fodor and
Pylyshyn's critique of connectionism.  Certain neglected but crucial
aspects of these notions make them more troublesome for connectionism
than has been previously acknowledged.  First, connectionism must
provide a way of embedding reasoning within certain types of context.
For instance, a system must be able to reason within the context of
another agent's beliefs.  Secondly, connectionism must provide a way
of matching two structured representations in working memory, as
opposed to merely associating working-memory items to long-term
memories.  Thirdly, there may be variables within working memory
representations, not just within long-term rules. These three points
lead to significant systematicity and structure-sensitivity
requirements over and above those that have already been discussed 
in the connectionism/symbolicism debate.  The paper is, nevertheless, 
generally sympathetic to connectionism, and its intent is to clear 
the way for further advances within that field.



Ball, Jerry T., (1992), PM, Propositional Model, a Computational
Psycholinguistic Model of Language Comprehension Based on a Relational
Analysis of Written English   (Summary Paper), CRL, MCCS-92-229. ($7.00)

A computational psycholinguistic model of written language comprehension
called PM (Propositional Model) is described.  PM consists of two basic
components: (1) a propositional system of representation for representing
the relational structure and content of written English sentences, and (2)
a processing mechanism for constructing propositional representations
directly from written English input.  PM is a highly interactive model.
Written English text is processed directly into propositional
representations.  There is no separate syntactic analysis and no distinctly
syntactic representations exist.  The processing mechanism is lexically
driven and most knowledge of language is assumed to be encoded in the
lexicon.  Of particular importance is the information encoded by relational
lexical items.  That information sets up expectations which drive the
processing mechanism.  It also determines the possible propositional
structures.  After describing PM, the use of PM for computerized NLP is
considered.  A brief comparison of PM with compatible linguistic approaches
follows.  Finally, two experiments which support the interactive nature of
PM are presented.  Important influences on the development of PM have been
Y.  Wilks (Preference Semantics), R. Langacker and G. Lakoff (Cognitive
Linguistics), T. Givon (Functional-Typological Grammar), W. Kintsch and J.
R. Anderson (Propositional Representations), G. A. Miller and P.
Johnson-Laird (Lexical Semantics), and P.  Johnson-Laird (Mental Models).



Barnden, John A., (1992), Beliefs, Connectionism, Meta-Representation,
Vagueness:  Stirring the Pot, CRL, MCCS-92-230. ($5.00)

I discuss two separate topics in the area of propositional attitude
representation.  One is the question of how to treat vague
quantification (viz.  {\it most}, {\it several}, and so on) within
propositional attitude contexts, as for example when someone says
``John believes that most of his toenails are ingrown.''  I report
some initial considerations on this issue. The intention is to fill in
a lacuna in propositional attitude research, which has been too
narrowly concerned with strict universal and existential
quantification.  The other topic is to do with the representation of
attitudes in non-implementational connectionist systems.  It throws
some light on attitude representation issues as well as on
connectionism.  One prominent way of representing attitudes is by
means of meta-logics, including quotational logics.  Meta-logic
provides some of the most expressively powerful attitude
representation approaches.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties in
importing its central ideas into non-implementational connectionist
systems.  I suggest that some of the difficulties are removed by
meta-linguistic attitude representation proposals.  These have terms
denoting natural language sentences or utterances.  An independent
reason for considering such approaches is that they are strongly
related to a prevalent commonsense metaphor of attitudes, namely the
model of beliefs and so on as internal, natural language utterances.
The discussion of the second topic reveals that connectionist concerns
with representation have been insufficiently general, in failing to
address the need for a cognitive system to be able to think about
complex structured expressions, as opposed to thinking with them.


Iverson, Eric and Helmreich, Stephen, (1992), Metallel: An Integrated
Approach to Non-literal Phrase Interpretation, CRL, MCCS-92-231. ($5.00)

Metallel is a program that incorporates marker passing techniques
within a preference/collative semantics framework.  This allows for
the simultaneous generation of literal and non-literal meaning
representations, while allowing for a much greater degree of
parallelism during processing.  In addition, we have integrated
metonymic and metaphoric inferencing into one procedure, arguing that
at least some types of metaphor can be represented as parallel
metonymies.  A number of examples are presented which show that
metallel's output is roughly equivalent to conventional, rule-based
approaches to metonymy.


Barnden, John A., 1992, On Using Analogy to Reconcile Connections and
Symbols, CRL, MCCS-92-232. ($7.00)

How do we gain both standard advantages of connectionism and those of
symbolic systems, without adopting hybrid symbolic/connectionist
systems?  Fully connectionist systems that support analogy-based
reasoning are proposed as an answer, at least in the realm of
high-level cognitive processing.  This domain includes commonsense
reasoning and the semantic/pragmatic aspects of natural language
processing.  The proposed type of system, purely by being
analogy-based, gains forms of graceful degradation, representation
completion, similarity-based generalization, learning, rule-emergence
and exception-emergence.  The system therefore gains advantages
commonly associated with connectionism, although the precise forms of
the benefits are different.  At the same time, through being fully
connectionist, the system also gains the traditional connectionist
variants of those advantages, as well as gaining further advantages
not provided by analogy-based reasoning per se.  And, because the
system is in part an implementation of a form of symbolic processing,
it preserves the flexible handling of complex, temporary structures
that are well supported in traditional artificial intelligence and
which are essential for high-level cognitive processing.  The chapter
is in part a reaction against the excessive polarization of the
connectionism/symbolicism debate.  This polarization is seen as
resulting from over-simplified, monolithic views both of what symbolic
processing encompasses and of the nature of the benefits that
connectionism provides.  



Dunning, Ted, Cowie, Jim, & Wakao, Takahiro, 1992, An Analysis of a
Parallel Japanese-English Corpus, CRL, MCCS-92-233. ($5.00)

We have analyzed a data set consisting of 10,000 paired English and
Japanese scientific abstracts.  Roughly 80% of these abstracts are
direct translations, with the remainder being summaries in Japanese of
originally English texts.  This is the first example of a parallel
corpus pairing English with any oriental language that we are familiar
with.  We show that Japanese in Extended Unix Code (EUC) is relatively
more efficient at encoding information than English in ASCII, but that
the information content of the two is similar.  We present the results
of a standard frequency analysis of the Japanese corpus alone,
including character, character bigram, word and word bigram frequency
analyses.  Further, we present the results of statistical studies
which attempt to extract a translation glossary from the paired texts
and an initial assessment of the feasibility of automatic sentence
alignment based on an analysis of 100 texts whose sentences were
aligned manually.

Jin, Wanying, 1992, A Case Study: Chinese Segmentation and its
Disambiguation, CRL, MCCS-92-237. ($5.00)

This paper first reviews the techniques used in the current Chinese
segmentation systems. The methods include character string match,
generate-and-test approach and knowledge-based expert system approach.
A proposed algorithm for segmenting Chinese sentences in news 
articles is then presented. The basic idea is to use each character in
the input string as an index to retrieve a list of candidate words
from a Chinese lexical database, and then use the input string
as a filter to rule out all the incompatible candidates. All compatible
candidates are aligned to produce the plausible strings as hypotheses.
The difficulties in Chinese segmentation are also discussed. A
technique of reasoning under uncertainty is studied in an attempt 
of solving problems in disambiguation. Finally, a knowledge-based
plausible reasoning mechanism is proposed.

Stein, Gees C., (1993), Genus Verb Disambiguation: Possible or
Impossible, CRL, MCCS-93-240. ($5.00)

The problem of verb disambiguation is of interest to many research
projects. This paper concentrates on the disambiguation of verbs as
used in verb definitions: the genus verb.

The verb definitions in the on-line dictionary LDOCE (Longman
Dictionary of Contemporary English, 1984) contain not only definition
sentences and example sentences, but also grammatical information,
pragmatic information and semantic information among others.

The algorithm developed for the genus disambiguation is based on the
definition and example sentences, the pragmatic information (in which
contexts is a word in general used, like Law, Engineering etc.) and on
semantic information (what kind of subject does a verb prefer).

The algorithm was tested on a hand-disambiguated test set of 100 verb
definitions. The disambiguation was done with respect to the
definitions as found in LDOCE.

The final results looked promising although verbs have some specific
problems. Future work has to decide whether this approach really is

Research Issues in Machine Translation at the Computing Research
Laboratory, CRL, MCCS-92-242. ($5.00) 

In this paper, several issues related to Machine Translation and the
ULTRA MT system that is currently under development at the Computing
Research Laboratory (CRL) at New Mexico State University are
presented.  ULTRA is a five-language, interlingual-based system
(English, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Japanese).  Its theoretical
goals lie in the area of pragmatics and communication, though to date
this aspect has been implemented in only a limited manner.

This paper emphasizes on issues which are particularly pertinent to
interlingual systems and to those based on communicative principles.
The approach to each of these issues within the ULTRA system and some
of the ancillary tools to assist in the process of MT-system research
are described.  For example, a multi-lingual interface which supports
special character sets and a lexicon-building menu system are
described.  The current state of the ULTRA system are summarized and
future research directions are discussed.


Wilks, Yorick, First Workshop of the Consortium for Lexical Research,
1992, CRL, MCCS-92-243. ($7.00)

This document is a brief record of the presentations and
discussion at the first workshop of the Consortium for Lexical
Research (CLR), held at Las Cruces, New Mexico in January 1992. The
nature and role of the CLR is explained at the end of this document.
The workshop brought together researchers, publishers, funders and
consumers of lexical data to discuss how a range of key legal and
intellectual issues related to the functioning of the CLR.

The transcript is partial and must be viewed in that light: notes were
taken by a range of people and transcribed but, inevitably, some kept
much fuller notes than others and my editing cannot repair that, so
that the space given here to speakers is a function of the fullness of
the notes and NOT of the length of what was said. It should be born in
mind that the words ascribed to speakers are not literally their own,
and we have avoided a lengthy process of consulting them because any
editing by the speakers themselves would inevitably destroy dialogue
coherence. Hence this record will not receive any formal publication
beyond this form, and anyone who feels they have been misrepresented
must accept my apologies.

The workshop was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation and
the Association for Computational Linguistics, and many thanks are due
to the relevant officers at all three institutions.

Barnden, John & Srinivas, K., 1992, Working Memory Variables, Logical
Combinators and Systematicity, CRL, MCCS-92-245. ($5.00)

The connectionist problem of achieving the quantificational effect of
symbolic variables is well recognized.  However, one relatively
neglected issue is that of variables in working memory representations
(arising, for instance, from natural language inputs), as opposed to
variables in rules.  Working memory variables present difficulties,
centering on the arbitrariness of the set of variables used in any
given expression, and on non-uniformity in expressions and
manipulations.  However, the variables can in principle be avoided,
for instance by using logical combinators.  These are special
functions much studied within the symbol processing arena.  The use of
combinators makes structures less arbitrary and more uniform.  The
reduced arbitrariness ameliorates an important systematicity problem,
and the added uniformity could facilitate high-level parallelism.  We
do not claim that the combinator approach is definitely the right one
to adopt, because of some problems.  Nevertheless, combinators need to
be borne in mind, and the symbolic/connectionist debate has been
over-simplified in ignoring them.  We discuss several ways in which
combinator-based working memory items could be implemented in
connectionism, with special attention to reduced-representation
implementations.  We also compare the combinator approach with the
technique of using canonical sets of variables in expressions.


Bruce, Rebecca, Wilks, Yorick, Guthrie, Louise, Slator, Brian, and
Dunning, Ted, 1992, NounSense - A Disambiguated Noun Taxonomy with a
Sense of Humour, CRL, MCCS-92-246. ($7.00)

The Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University is
involved in a project to create a data-base of lexical facts in the
form of a network of semantically related word senses.  The data-base
will support the automatic construction of lexicons for many types of
natural language processing systems.  In this paper we discuss
NounSense, a disambiguated IS-A hierarchy of nouns automatically
constructed from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE).  The primary focus of our presentation will be on the
techniques used to construct the network, and on its semantic readable
dictionaries in general.  Additionally we will present a brief
overview of the interface developed for NounSense, as we feel it
incorporates many features that enhance the usability of the
information in the data-base.  Finally, we will exhibit the fact that
our network does contain a sense of humor, indeed more than one, with
some interesting taxonomical relationships.


Wang, Jin and Wilks, Yorick, 1992, Protocols for Reference Sharing in
a Belief Ascription Model of Communication, CRL, MCCS-92-248. ($5.00)

The basic idea behind the \fIViewGen\fR model is that each agent
involved in a conversation has a belief space which includes models of
what other parties to the conversation believe.  The distinctive
notion is that a basic procedure, called belief ascription allows
belief spaces to be amalgamated so as to model the updating and
augmentation of belief environments. In this paper we extend the
\fIViewGen\fR model to a more general account of reference phenomena,
in particular by the notion of an ascription path (AP) that links
intensional objects across belief environments so as to locate the
most heuristically plausible referent at a given point in a
conversation.  The key notion is the location and attachment of
entities that may be under different descriptions, the consequent
updating of the system's beliefs about other agents by default, and
the role in that process of speaker's and hearer's protocols that
ensure that the choice is the appropriate one. The purpose of these
protocols is to make the models of other agent's beliefs as good a
representation as possible given the information to hand, and to make
the agent's own beliefs more accessible to the other (on the
assumption no deception is involved).  The important characteristic of
this model is that each communicator considers nothing beyond his own
belief space.


Guthrie, Louise, Guthrie, Joe, Wilks, Yorick,  Cowie, Jim, Farwell,
David, Slator, Brian, and Bruce, Rebecca, 1992, A research program on
machine-tractable dictionaries and their application to text analysis,
CRL, MCCS-92-249. ($5.00)

Machine-readable dictionaries (MRD's) contain substantial knowledge
about language and the world essential for large-scale tasks in
natural language processing (NLP), though an important empirical
question remains whether it is sufficient for such tasks. This
knowledge, however, collected and recorded by lexicographers for human
readers, is not expressed in MRD's in a form that can be used directly
as a tool for NLP tasks.  What the NLP research community needs is
machine tractable dictionaries (MTD's); that is, MRD's transformed
into a format appropriate for NLP tasks.

At CRL we have explored several large-scale computational methods for
the transformation of MRD's into MTD's, and have also developed a
range of tools for extracting information from MRD's for specific NLP
applications. We describe here a combination of these methods, based
on their respective strengths: a hybrid SPIRAL methodology that
combines elements from each of the methods (numerical and
non-numerical) into a single coherent procedure to produce an MTD or
lexical-knowledge base.  Our hope is that, although each of the
methods is incomplete in certain respects, and so a weak method in
Newell's sense, the combination of them will yield better results than
any individual method could. The chief difficulty with the MRD itself
is that the defining items in the dictionary are themselves ambiguous,
and it is this that the SPIRAL methodology seeks to overcome.

The result is an MTD that is a knowledge-base of unambiguous lexical
facts, linked by a network of semantically-related word senses.  It is
currently derived from Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE), though we are augmenting that from other MRD's such as
COBUILD.  We also describe briefly one application of the MTD to
machine translation, and the extension of the disambiguation
techniques used in construction of the MTD to large-scale
sense-tagging of general text.  The end goal of the work described
here is to develop methods for the production of larger systems faster
than can be achieved with custom-made lexicons.


Dunning, Ted and Davis, Mark, (1993), Multi-lingual Information
Retrieval, CRL, MCCS-93-252. ($5.00)

We have designed a fully multi-lingual information retrieval system
and tested crucial parts.  This system can accept a query in one
language and find documents in others.  Furthermore, relevance
feedback can be used in a fully multi-lingual fashion.

Our system is based on the availability of parallel and aligned texts.
We use these texts to derive a linear approximation of the translation
process, and then use this linear transformation to implement a
conventional vector based information retrieval system.  We describe
three possible techniques for deriving this translation matrix, one of
which we have implemented and tested on a relatively moderately sized
training corpus.  Our method appears to be very efficient in terms of
the size of the necessary training corpus.

Since our solution for the translation matrix is incremental in
nature, additional parallel texts can be used to augment the system at
any time.


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Second Workshop of the Consortium for Lexical Research:
US/European Lexical Cooperation, CRL, MCCS-93-254. ($5.00)

In January 1993 the Computing Research Laboratory hosted a workshop on
international cooperation of lexical computation under the auspices of
the Consortium for Lexical Research and supported by the National
Science Foundation and the European Commission.  This document is a
report of the discussion and presentations.


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Stone Soup and the French Room: the
empiricist-rationalist debate about machine translation, CRL,
MCCS-93-255. ($5.00)

The paper argues that the IBM statistical approach to machine
translation has done rather better after a few years than many
sceptics believed it could. However, it is neither as novel as its
proponents suggest nor is it making claims as clear and simple as they
would have us believe. The performance of the purely statistical
system (and we discuss what that phrase could mean) has not equalled
the performance of SYSTRAN. More importantly, the system is now being
shifted to a hybrid that incorporates much of the linguistic
information that it was initially claimed by IBM would not be needed
for MT. Hence, one might infer that its own proponent do not believe
"pure" statistics sufficient for MT of a usable quality. In addition
to real limits on the statistical method, there are also strong
economic limits imposed by their methodology of data gathering.
However, the paper concludes that the IBM group have done the field a
great service in pushing these methods far further than before, and by
reminding everyone of the virtues of empiricism in the field and the
need for large scale gathering of data.

NO ABSTRACT


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Language, vision and metaphor, CRL,
MCCS-93-257. ($3.00)

The integration of language and vision capabilities in computers can
be seen purely as a multi-media task without any theoretical
assumptions being required.  However, it is worth exploring whether
the modalities have anything serious in common, in particular in the
light of the claim that most non-technical language use is
metaphorical.  What consequences would that have for the underlying
relationship of language and vision: is it possible that vision is
largely metaphorical?

The conclusion is that visual processing can embody structural
ambiguity (whether compositional or not), but not anything analogous
to metaphor.  Metaphor is essentially connected with the extension of
sense and only symbols can have senses.  But if it makes no sense to
say a figure can be metaphorical (unless it embodies symbolic
elements) that must also mean, alas, that it makes no sense to say it
is literally anything either.  Only a symbol can be literally
something.  A hat is a hat is a hat, but never, ever, literally so.


Wilks, Yorick, (1993), Penrose on Artificial Intelligence, CRL,
MCCS-93-258. ($3.00)

Penrose's attack on artificial intelligence (AI) will give its
practitioners less worry and discomfort than did its earlier
philosophical critics Dreyfus and Searle, answering whom busied AI-ers
for years. Penrose does not really understand his target, in the sense
of knowing first-hand the detail and variety of AI work. He seems to
have got much of his understanding of it second-hand from Searle whose
critical terminology he uses, unexamined. Moreover, some of his
arguments have already been well-rehearsed within philosophy, such as
the one about the possible relevance of Goedel's theorem to machine
intelligence.

None of this would matter if his arguments were good but they are not;
in the case of the Goedel argument he has added nothing not present in
the older version.  Penrose's only claim on our attention, apart
from his book sales, is that he is an established physicist and
mathematician, one with striking achievements to his name in topology,
cosmology and quantum theory as well as the discovery of a new
impossible object.

Although there has been much progress in developing theories,
models and systems in the areas of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and Vision Processing (VP) there has been little progress
on integrating these two subareas of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

It is not clear why there has not already been much activity in
integrating NLP and VP. Is it because of the long-time
reductionist trend in science up
until the recent emphasis on chaos theory, non-linear systems,
and emergent behaviour? Or, is it because the people who have tended to
work on NLP tend to be in other Departments, or of a different ilk,
to those who have worked on VP?

Whatever the reason, we believe it is high time to bring together
these two areas of AI research. In this endeavour, we are calling for papers
for a special issue of AI Review Journal dedicated
to site descriptions, surveys, tutorials, and viewpoints on integrated NLP
and VP research.

                 ----------------------------
                An international effort to promote 
         the development and use of free text software


The widespread availability of large amounts of electronic text and 
linguistic data in recent years has dramatically increased the need 
for generally available, flexible text software. Commercial software 
for text analysis and manipulation covers only a fraction of 
research needs, and it is often expensive and hard to adapt or 
extend to fit a particular research problem. Software developed by 
individual researchers and labs is often experimental and hard to 
get, hard to install, under-documented, and sometimes unreliable. 
Above all, most of this software is incompatible.

As a result, it is not at all uncommon for researchers to develop 
tailor-made systems that replicate much of the functionality of 
other systems and in turn create programs that cannot be re-used by 
others, and so on in an endless software waste cycle. The 
reusability of data is a much-discussed topic these days; similarly, 
we need "software reusability", to avoid the re-inventing of the 
wheel characteristic of much language-analytic research in the past 
three decades.

The Text Software Initiative (TSI) is committed to solving this 
problem by working to 

     o establish and publish guidelines and standards for the 
       development of text software;

     o promulgate and coordinate the development of free TSI-
       conformant software.

The scope of the TSI covers all areas of analysis and manipulation 
of all kinds of texts (written or spoken, mono-lingual or multi-
lingual parallel, etc.), including markup of physical and logical 
text features, linguistic analysis and annotation, browsing and 
retrieval, statistical analysis, and other text-related tasks in 
research in computational linguistics, humanities computing, 
terminology and lexicography, speech, etc. 

The TSI software development effort is distributed, that is, anyone 
can contribute on a voluntary basis. This means that tools will be 
developed according to the contributors' priorities; however, the 
TSI is ultimately working towards the development of a comprehensive 
text handling system.

To ensure software compatibility and reusability and enable 
distributed development, the TSI is committed to:

     o design and publish program interface conventions
     o determine and publish guidelines for programming style and 
       documentation
     o stress separation of code and linguistic data to ensure
       (natural) language independence
     o emphasize breaking high-level text-handling tasks into
       more primitive, reusable functions
     o provide a library of primitive text-handling tools
     o maintain a task list and set priorities
     o circulate information such as progress reports, revisions to 
       the standard, availability of new software, etc.
     o set up a mechanism for testing and evaluation
     o maintain mailing lists for comments, bug reports, 
       suggestions, etc.

The TSI works in relation with other standardization groups, notably 
the Text Encoding Initiative and the Expert Advisory Group on 
Language Engineering Standards (EAGLES).

All TSI software is free in the sense defined in the Free Software 
Foundation's General Public License, which guarantees the freedom to 
copy, redistribute, and modify software, and protects this freedom 
by requiring those who pass on the software to include the rights to 
further redistribute it and see and change the code.

Distribution of TSI software is accomplished in relation with other 
dissemination groups such as the Free Software Foundation, RELATOR, 
and the Linguistic Data Consortium. The TSI does not provide 
technical support, but organizes a network of voluntary consultants 
and support people.

Subject: Query: simple machine translation


We are looking for a simple-minded Unix
application that accepts English on
standard-in and prints out simple,
word-by-word translation into other
languages (Japanese, German, French)
attached to the original English
on standard-out.

The application will be used as an 
E-mail front-end for non-native 
English speakers: The idea is that 
they could skim the rough translation 
in their native language to decide if 
they should read the original English 
or not.

Subject: Announcement: Workshop on [various] methods in Logic Programming



   Second Workshop on Structural Complexity and Recursion-theoretic
                 Methods in Logic Programming

International Symposium on Logic Programming, Vancouver, 
                   October 23-26, 1993


This workshop will be devoted to Structural Complexity
and Recursion-Theoretic methods in Logic Programming. 

It is addressed to the  community seeking to analyze the constructions 
of logic programming from the complexity and recursion-theoretic 
perspective. We foresee a variety of papers -- perhaps more 
specialized than the papers normally accepted by symposia and 
conferences on Logic Programming -- devoted to the area. 

At the Workshop we will discuss problems related to structural 
complexity and computational complexity of propositional (deductive 
database) extended logic programs .  The complexity of 
disjunctive databases has given rise previously to diverse analyses 
from several points of view; in particular, how to detect classes
of such program so that inference procedures in their full
generality need be used only occasionally in practice.  Most
of the analysis in this area remains to be done, particularly
concerning the interaction of different forms of negation.  Moreover, 
there are now linear/mathematical programming techniques available 
for deductive databases whose complexity analysis in this context 
has only begun, as well as uniform game-theoretic approaches 
involving imposed complexity bounds.


General Format, Attendance and Support:

We expect a half-day workshop (an afternoon and an evening) with 
approximately 30 participants, drawn from the structural complexity,
database and logic programming communities.  We expect that some 
10 to 12 short communications 30 min presentation and 10 min. 
discussion would be presented, with ample time for discussion among 
participants.  Especially encouraged will be reports of work in 
progress.  Extended abstracts will be reviewed for suitability by 
the organizers with the stress on originality and new problem
areas rather than the presence of specific technical results.

Mathematical Sciences Institute at Cornell University will provide
partial support to some participants.  Support will be provided for 
travel in select justified cases. Apply with the submission of your
extended abstract.

Subject: Query: generative grammars for English



I want to generate automatically all the (approximately) semantically
equivalent variations of a sentence.  For example, the sentence:

    "Most of our workstations are Suns."
can be rewritten:
    "Our workstations are mostly Suns."
or:
    "Mostly our workstations are Suns."
or:
    "Suns are most of our workstations."

Please let me know of any public domain programs or databases that
can help generate such variations.  I think that the rules guiding
such variations are called "generative" or "transformational" grammars.
(I hear that the Alvey Toolkit has a good parser, but I also need
the generative grammars.)

Also, at the risk of further mutating the meaning of a sentence,
I would like to substitute synonyms.  I just heard about WordNet.
Are there other public domain on-line resources that I should check?

                                 or       kevin_q_brown@att.com

PS: I do not have "telnet" access to the Internet, but I can send
    Internet email.  That enables me to use Archie and ftpmail to
    find and retrieve specific files, but not do casual browsing.

NEW SIRI SERVICES

PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN PUT TO WORK...

Following feedback from our readers, the SIRI (Service integre de ressources
d'information/Integrated Service for Information Resources) team at the Canadian
Workplace Automation Research Centre (CWARC) is in the process of revising its
products, services and policies.  

For anyone in an interdisciplinary field wanting to remain fully up-to-date,
scanning multiple journals on a regular basis is critical.  It is, however, a
time-consuming activity.  Moreover, one may not necessarily have access to all
the relevant periodicals dealing with the subject being researched.  The
objective of the SIRI team, therefore, is to offer through FLASH INFORMATION and
a new additional product (which is yet to be named), a selective dissemination
of information specifically geared towards the information needs of researchers
and management within the fields of information management and information
technologies.   These electronic publications will keep our readers up-to-date
by providing details of relevant newly published information scanned from some
300 journals and news bulletins from our collection on a weekly basis.  

OUR NEW FORMAT....  

The SIRI team is working toward improving the contents, format and access of
FLASH INFORMATION.  Future issues of FLASH INFORMATION, our bibliographic issue
of articles on information technologies and industry news, for example, will be
more comprehensive and entries will be grouped under general subject headings. 
Topics identified reflect the Centre's main research interests which include
language technology, content engineering, multimedia, human-computer interaction
issues, and learning technologies.  An indexed listing of the journals scanned
will be provided upon request.  

OUR NEW PRODUCT....  

Whereas FLASH INFORMATION is a list of titles of articles, our new product will
consist of abstracts of articles.  This publication will provide researchers and
management with news on strategic alliances within the industry and the Canadian
government, industry news and issues, market and R & D trends, and recent
developments in information/computer/communications related fields.  These
abstracts will be distributed jointly with FLASH INFORMATION.  

The list of subject headings, an example of FLASH INFORMATION in its new format
and sample entries of our new product are included. 

TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN PUT TO WORK....  

Up to now FLASH INFORMATION has been made available free of charge. We will
continue sending you FLASH INFORMATION together with our new publication free
until September.  In order to provide you with the new products and services,
however, a minimal subscription fee may be charged beginning September in order
to recover some of the production costs.  
 
We would like to accommodate the needs of as many readers as possible;  we would
appreciate it, therefore, if you could supply us with the name and the electronic
address of anyone who may be interested in our services.  If you have any new
ideas, suggestions or comments, please contact us at Siri@aigle.ccrit.doc.ca.

Telco Deals Start Paying Off
Source:  Computing Canada, April 26, 1993, pp. 32-34
by James Buchok

ABSTRACT:    As a result of alliances between Canadian-U.S.-based companies
such as the one forged by Stentor Alliance of Canada's and MCI Communications
Corp., telecommunication rates have been greatly reduced.  The two companies have
recently introduced the cross-border virtual corporate network (VCN), known as
the Advantage VNet, providing networking services to large Canadian businesses. 
Virtual networks allow sharing of long distance voice and data lines with other
customers bringing rates down by as much as 30 to 50 percent.  Further, high
volume users can also benefit from discounts of up to 22 percent off their total
bill.

The linking of Stentor's Impac service with MCI's HyperStream will create the
first international frame relay service available in the world.  HyperStream, as
the service has been named,  will provide a cross-border, high-speed frame relay
data network linking local area networks between cities.

Stentor's main competitor, AT&T which forged an alliance with Unitel in January,
has introduced a software package similar to  Advantage VNet, the SDN (Software
Defined Network).

      1.    Applications architecture;
      2.    Client/server technology; 
      3.    Collaborative work environments;
      4.    Computer/Human interaction;
      5.    Mobile computing;
      6.    Multimedia;
      7.    Object technology;
      8.    Performance and measurement.

Topics emphasized will be object technology (development languages, tools and
DBMS), multimedia (applications with interactive video and audio), and mobile
computing (pen-based computing, wireless data communications and the integration
of mobile technologies with client/server systems).  Activities will include
software performance testing particularly in complex client/server applications
involving multiple systems and multiple servers.  The research focus, however,
is expected to change to match business needs.

				CALL FOR PAPERS 

		16th International Conference on SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

	         	Sorrento, Italy, May 16-21, 1994
	

The objective of ICSE is to foster the development of the software engineering
field by: 
1) providing a forum for the introduction and discussion of new 
   software engineering research results; 
2) providing the practicing engineer an evaluation of evolving research;  
3) providing the research community exposure to the problems of practical
   applications of software engineering;  
4) encouraging the exchange of advanced software technology and experience
   within the international community. 
To address these goals ICSE-16 will integrate a variety of events: 
presentations of technical papers, panels, tutorials, research workshops 
and tools demonstrations.

REFEREED PAPERS should include a short abstract, a list of descriptive keywords,
specification of the type of submission (Research/ Experience) and complete
contact information for the lead author. Submissions must be no longer than 
6000 words. Their content must not have been previously published, nor be
currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.
RESEARCH PAPERS will be evaluated for originality, significance, soundness, 
and clarity. Theoretical and methodological papers should clearly show how the
results presented contribute to software engineering practice.  Papers on
systems should concentrate on technical and architectural issues rather than 
providing feature-by-feature descriptions. Experimental papers should describe
the experimental method used and interpret the results in terms of practice.
EXPERIENCE REPORTS will be evaluated for significance of the lessons and
insights gained from use of advanced methods and techniques. 
All papers should clearly indicate what is new and significant about the work
presented and how it compares with related work. Accepted papers will appear 
in the conference proceedings. The best papers will be considered for
publication in a special issue of ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and 
Methodology (ACM TOSEM).

PANEL PROPOSALS should include the title, a brief description of the objectives
and issues to be covered, the panel chair and probable panelists (including
short vitae). Panels will be selected according to their substance and
contributions to the conference program.

SUBMISSIONS of eight (8) copies of Papers and Panel Proposals should be sent by
September 6, 1993 to program co-chair, Axel van Lamsweerde.

TUTORIAL PROPOSALS should address important software engineering topics that 
are of particular interest to practitioners. Proposals should include a 
detailed topical outline of the material to be covered, should specify the
proposed length of the tutorial (full or half day), and the background and
experience of the instructor. Proposal selection will be based upon
appropriateness of the topic, quality of the outline, credentials of the
instructor, and likely appeal of the topic to prospective conference attendees.
Tutorial Proposals should be sent by September 6, 1993 to tutorial co-chair
Aniello Cimitile.

TOOLS FAIR PROPOSALS should suggest the demonstration of tools, systems and
environments that represent the best of current research work or commercially
available products. Proposals should include a brief description of the
software to be demonstrated, the demonstration itself, and any technical 
presentations desired. The character of these demonstrations and presentations
must be consistent with the scholarly nature of ICSE. Tools Fair proposal
selection will be based upon the importance, relevance, and novelty of the
software to be demonstrated. Proposals should be submitted by  January 31, 1994
to Tools Fair co-chair Alfonso Fuggetta.

WORKSHOPS. Three pre-Conference workshops will explore research issues at the
intersection between Software Engineering and other disciplines. The subject
areas and contact points for these workshops are: 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DATABASES  
(Roger King: roger@cs.colorado.edu),

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
(Steve Fickas: fickas@cs.uoregon.edu), 

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION 
(Dick Taylor: taylor@ics.uci.edu). 

Each workshop will develop a research agenda, which will be presented at a
special session of the conference. 
There will also be a post-Conference workshop on SOFTWARE ENGINEERING EDUCATION
(contact: Anthony Finkelstein, acwf@doc.ic.ac.uk). 
Please contact the Workshop Chairs for information on how to participate.

Subject: Query: Object Systems for KR Symposium Proposal


Greetings!

Attached below is a copy of a proposal we are sending to the
AAAI Spring Symposium for the 1994 series. A similar workshop is being
held in conjunction with IJCAI this year. Most of the participants at 
the IJCAI workshop are from across the atlantic. So it justifies having 
one here in the US. We have added additional topics/issues.

This message is to inform you about our attempts at scheduling the
Symposium, as well as to solicit responses in order to identify 
possible research communities.

Can you please respond to the proposal below on the following accounts:

1) Are you interested in the topic and the issues listed?
2) Will you be interested in sending a paper?
3) Will you be interested in participating?
4) Will you be interested in acquiring a copy of the working notes?
5) If you care enough about the topic, please send us a short
   paragraph describing your research so as to help us identify
   further issues that may form the focus of the symposium.

This message is going out to several mailing lists please respond only
to me. I will consolidate responses and provide a summary to people who
request it.  Please feel free to forward this to other interested people. 
Looking forward to hearing from you on this at the earliest.

Proposal for
The 1994 AAAI Spring Symposium Series


Title: Object-Based Systems for Knowledge Representation

Description:

We wish to explore issues related to the development of AI systems using
object-based techniques. Many researchers take an object-oriented
approach toward the design of an intelligent system where domain
classification hierarchies are implemented as object hierarchies in
order to exploit inheritance or more generally property sharing
of domain characteristics. We have in mind systems where not only 
are its applications object-oriented, but the system itself is 
constructed using object-oriented techniques. The resulting AI 
architecture can potentially exploit all the benefits of the 
object-oriented approach--- uniform protocols, extensibility,
increased modularity (leading to larger scale applications), and
amenability to concurrent and distributed processing. The resulting
architectures may be extensible not only in their representational
ontologies, but also their reasoning techniques (logical deduction,
classification-based reasoning, procedural reasoning using message
passing or demons, rules, and constraints). Moreover, extensibility may
also allow the integration of other AI faculties like adding a
planning/acting, or a natural language faculty to the architecture. The
construction of much larger scale knowledge based systems may be enabled
by wedding an object-based AI architecture to a persistent object
storage system. It has been claimed that a uniform communication
protocol enables a high degree of parallelism as well as
distributedness.  A canonical object-oriented view of a representational
formalism can facilitate knowledge sharing among heterogenous systems in
that translation of queries between formalisms becomes easier. This also
ties up well with the ideas being pursued by the ARPA Knowledge Sharing
Efforts. The following specific issues will be explored by the
participants at the symposium:

 - the notion of an ``object'' as a conceptual entity in a KR formalism 
 - the notion of an ``object'' as a logical entity; distinguishing between
   objects and terms
 - modeling of fundamental relationships: specialization, generalization
 - object-based ontologies (conceptual as well as (or vs) logical)
 - reifying the propositions attached to an object, e.g., to facilitate a
   reason maintenance component
 - reasoning with objects: inheritance, classification, logics, planning,
   acting, rules, constraints
 - the distributedness of an object-based architecture; the impact of
   object-based systems to architectures on knowledge sharing
 - persistence in object-based knowledge bases


Evidence:

A workshop entitled ``Object-Based Representation Systems'' and
organized by Amedeo Napoli will be held before the IJCAI Conference in
Chambery, on August the 28th, 1993. This workshop will gather about 40
researchers and will include nine presentations of papers and a panel
session. The subjects that will be discussed are terminological logics,
the integration of various representational and reasoning techniques
(such as planning, representation of time, constraints, rules, and
classification), theoretical aspects of knowledge representation
formalisms, and the possible bridges existing between database and
knowledge base systems. Results from the Chambery workshop will serve as
a springboard for the AAAI Symposium.

HARD FACT IN A WORLD OF FANTASY


A world of sheer fantasy awaits your arrival at the IEEE World Congress on 

Computational Intelligence next year; our host is Walt Disney World  in 

Orlando Florida.  Simultaneous Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and 

Evolutionary Programming conferences will provide an unprecedented 

opportunity for technical development while the charms of the nearby Magic 

Kingdom and Epcot Center attempt to excite your fancies.



The role imagination has played in the development of Computational 

Intelligence techniques is well known; before they became "innovative" the 

various CI technologies were dismissed as "fantasies" of brilliant minds.



Now these tools are real; perhaps it's only appropriate that they should be 

further explored and their creators honored in a world of the imagination, a 

world where dreams come true.



Share your facts at Disney World; share your imagination.  Come to the IEEE 

World Congress on Computational Intelligence.



It's as new as tomorrow.

But this expands the corpus about 20% to about 5.3 Mb, making it less
wieldy to edit and to scan by eye.  The intent of the seven-bit ASCII
formatting is to make it easy to use this data across platforms from
Unix boxes to Macs and MS-DOS OS's.
 
Does the readership have any preferences?  I'm planning to
freeze the corpus by Friday, 18 June.  Thanks to everyone
for their help improving this compilation.

Subject: CFP: 10th IEEE Conference on AI for Applications


				   
			   CALL FOR PAPERS
				   
			       CAIA-94
		     The Tenth IEEE Conference on
	      Artificial Intelligence for Applications:
				   
		 Developing Enabling Technologies and
	      Integrating AI into Application Solutions
				   
	       Marriott Riverwalk - San Antonio, Texas
			   March 1-4, 1994
				   

Increasingly, the role of AI in business  and  scientific  applications  is
that  of  one  component in a complex system. Integrating AI with knowledge
sources and  databases,  user  interfaces,  and  existing  software  is  an
important aspect of advancing the application of AI to real world problems.
This year's conference will emphasize both the development of  enabling  AI
technology  and  the  issues involved in the integration of this technology
into products and processes. We are also seeking innovative ideas  for  new
application  areas  and new research and technology transfer paradigms. Our
goal is to  increase  interaction  between  different  communities  and  to
increase  our  understanding  of  how AI technology can be applied to real-
world problems.

With these goals in mind, two general  kinds  of  papers  are  appropriate.
First  are  case  studies of AI applications that address significant real-
world problems.  These papers must (1) justify the use of the AI technique,
based  on  the problem and application requirements, (2) explain how the AI
technology contributed to  the  solution  and  was  integrated  with  other
components, and (3) describe the status of the implementation.

Second are papers on novel AI techniques and  principles  that  may  enable
more  ambitious  real-world  applications.  All  the  usual  AI  topics are
appropriate. These papers must (1) describe the importance of the  approach
from an applications context, (2) describe the work in sufficient technical
detail and clarity, (3) clearly and thoroughly differentiate the work  from
previous efforts.

While finished work is important, one major role for this conference is  as
a  forum  for  exchanging  ideas.  For this reason, well-written reports on
work-in-progress and descriptions of innovative partial implementations are
encouraged.  In  fact,  we  hope  to  structure  CAIA-94 in several ways to
facilitate communication between researchers and practitioners.  First,  we
will  include  invited  speakers  on  various  appropriate  topics, of both
technical and more general scope. Second, panel sessions are very important
in  an inter-disciplinary area and will be a key feature of CAIA-94. Third,
CAIA will include a mix of introductory and advanced tutorials and a  small
workshop  program  oriented  towards  wide participation. Other, more novel
forums such as evening discussion sessions may be tried.

Papers should be limited to 5000 words and papers significantly longer that
this  will not be reviewed. Accepted papers will be allotted seven pages in
the conference proceedings, and the best papers will be  considered  for  a
special  issue  of  IEEE  Expert  to  appear  late  in 1994. Awards will be
presented to the best paper and best student paper at the conference.

The first page of the paper must contain the following  information  (where
applicable) in the order shown:

* Title.
* Author's name and affiliation (specify student status).
* Contact information (name, postal address, phone and email address).
* Abstract: A 200 word abstract that includes a clear statement  describing
  the paper's original contributions and what new lesson is imparted.
* AI topic: One or more  terms  describing  the  relevant  AI  areas,  e.g.
  knowledge acquisition, explanation, diagnosis, etc.
* Domain area: One or more terms describing the problem domain  area,  e.g.
  mechanical design, factory scheduling, education, medicine, etc.
* Language/Tool: Underlying programming languages, systems and tools used.
* Status: Development and deployment status, as appropriate.
* Effort: Person-years of effort put into developing the particular  aspect
  of the project being described.
* Impact: A 20 word description of estimated or measured (specify)  benefit
  of the application developed.

In addition to  papers,  we  will  be  accepting  the  following  types  of
submissions:

* Proposals for Panel Discussions. Provide a brief description of the topic
  (1000  words  or less). Indicate appropriateness for this conference, the
  membership  of  the  panel  and  interest  in  organizing/moderating  the
  discussion.

* Proposals for Tutorial Presentations. Proposals for three hour  tutorials
  of  both  an  introductory  and advanced nature are requested.  Tutorials
  which analyze classes of applications  in  depth  or  examine  techniques
  appropriate  for  a  particular  class  of applications are of particular
  interest. Include a detailed topic outline, a half-page synopsis  of  the
  focus,   topics,  a  list  of  benefits  to  the  audience,  and  a  full
  professional vita.

* Proposals for Workshops. Proposals are sought for one day workshops to be
  held  in  conjunction  with  the conference. These workshops should avoid
  having too narrow a scope (such  as  "AI  in  Radiology");  rather,  they
  should  be  designed  to  foster  communication  between both experts and
  interested  newcomers  about  a  broad  application  area  (for  example,
  "Applications  of  AI to Software") or address a concern that covers many
  applications (for example, "Issues in Technology  Transfer").  Include  a
  one-page description of the workshop and a small organizing committee.


Important Dates

                           Call  For  Participation



        Workshop  on  Logic  Programming  With  Incomplete  Information




The  aim  of  the  one  day  workshop  is  to  bring  together  researchers
working  on  different  aspects  of  representing  (and/or  reasoning
with)  incomplete  information  in  the  frame  work  of  logic
programming  and  databases.    The  workshop  will  be  held  in
conjunction  with  the  International  Logic  Programming  Symposium
(ILPS'93),  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada,  October  26  to
October  29,  1993.    The  workshop  will  be  held  after  the
conference.

The  format  of  the  workshop  will  be  in  the  form  of  short
presentations  and  discussions  on  completed  work  and  work  in
progress.    We  also  expect  the  workshop  to  be  informal,  providing
a  forum  for  close  interactions  between  participants.
Presentations  and  discussions  are  invited  on  any  topic  relevant
to  logic  programming  with  incomplete  information,  including  but
not  limited  to  extensions  of  logic  programming  by  disjunction,
null  values,  classical  (strong)  negation,  abduction  etc.    as
well  as  the  use  of  logic  programs  (and  their  extensions)  for
representing  incomplete  knowledge  in  specific  domains.

If  you  are  interested  in  giving  a  presentation  of  your  current
research  at  the  workshop,  please  send  an  extended  abstract
(about  6  pages)  by  August  10,  1993,  to  the  address  given  below.
Notification  of  acceptance  will  be  given  by  September  30,  1993,
and  the  revised  abstract  or  a  full  paper  will  be  due  on  October
10,  1993.    An  informal  proceedings  will  be  distributed  during
the  workshop.    Those  who  are  only  interested  in  attending  the
workshop  are  also  welcome  and  are  kindly  requested  to  send  their
postal  and  electronic  addresses.

 Tilburg, in the South of The Netherlands; the workshop then 
 moves to the of a resort in the Ardennes in Durbuy, Belgium.

 Topics of interest include:
 Theoretical and practical studies of parsing algorithms for 
 natural language sentences, texts, fragments, dialogues, 
 ill-formed sentences, speech input, and multi-dimensional 
 (pictorial) language.

 Time schedule
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The workshop will begin Tuesday 10 August at 9.00 a.m. at Tilburg 
 University. There will be paper presentations in the morning and in 
 the afternoon. At the end of the day there will be a reception at 
 Tilburg City Hall. 
 The workshop continues Wednesday morning. In the afternoon there will 
 be presentations of research at ITK, after which the workshop moves 
 by bus to Durbuy. There will be welcome drinks and dinner in the 
 conference hotel in Durbuy.
 There will be a full workshop day on Thursday, with a conference dinner 
 in the evening.
 On Friday August 13 the last workshop sessions are in the morning; 
 a closing lunch is included in the programme. We intend to arrange 
 bus transportation to Brussels and Tilburg immediately after lunch. 
 The bus should get to Brussels at approx. 4 p.m.


 Travel information
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 We will send you detailed information on how to get to the conference 
 location etc. to participants who have registered; here is some 
 preliminary information that may help you to plan your trip.

 Tilburg is served by frequent (fast and slow) trains. Tilburg is a 
 station on the international line The Hague - Rotterdam - Cologne, 
 and is served at half-hour intervals by intercity trains from 
 's-Hertogenbosch (also known as "Den Bosch") (direction Utrecht and 
 Amsterdam), from Breda (direction Rotterdam and Antwerp), and from 
 Eindhoven (directions Venlo/Cologne and Maastricht/Liege).

 From Amsterdam it takes 1.5 hours by train to Tilburg. (Change at 
 's-Hertogenbosch.)

 By car, Tilburg is approx. 1.5 hours driving from Amsterdam as well 
 as from Brussels.

 If you're travelling by plane, the most convenient airport for Tilburg 
 is Amsterdam. You can take the train directly at the airport. Depending 
 a little on how lucky you are, the train ride from Amsterdam airport to 
 Tilburg takes between 1.5 and 2 hours.

 Brussels airport is an alternative, but the train ride is longer (2.5 
 hours minimally; up to 4 hours) and the service is not that frequent as 
 from Amsterdam.

 An alternative if you're coming from a European destination is the 
 regional airport at Eindhoven, 30 kilometers from Tilburg. You can fly 
 there from London, Paris, Hamburg, Manchester, Birmingham, Strasbourg 
 and Zurich. 

 
          C a l l  f o r   R e g i s t r  a t i o n

 Students Arrangements
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 For students, looking for a low-budget possibility, we suggest the 
 nonresidential package plus accomodation in a cheap & simple hotel 
 in Tilburg, and in Durbuy either use of a camping ground (there is 
 an attractive camping very close to the conference hotel) or use of 
 a cheap hotel. These (relatively) cheap hotel rooms, which are 
 especially interesting if you share a double room, are only available 
 in small numbers and have to be negotiated on an individual basis 
 (the price for 4 nights will be in the order of $ 150). We are willing 
 to do this for you, so if you need this please let us know. 

   
 Method of payment:
 ------------------
 You can pay through credit card (Visa card) either in US dollars or

From: baker@acs.ucalgary.ca
Subject: Query: Philosophical work on AI/PDP in Canada


I have been asked to do an article whose role will be to say what
PHILOSOPHICAL work is being done on AI in Canada. I am
interpreting AI in such a way that I can cover both "classical"
AI AND work on connectionism. 

I have searched the electronic version of the Philosophers' Index
using all of the names of people in Canada who MIGHT be working
in this field as search terms. I have also searched for names I
recognise as working in Canada in the result of a search of
Philosophers' Index using as search terms "AI", "Connectionis?",
"PDP" and cognate wordings. 

The result has not in fact been as fruitful as I had hoped OR not
as many people in Canada are publishing work in this field as I
would have expected/hoped. Moreover, this search does not, of
course, tell me of work which has not (yet?) been published.

SO,  your help, ladies and gentlemen, would be much appreciated.
IF you know of people doing philosophical work on AI, construed
widely enough to included connectionism, then I would be very
grateful for your imput, preferably detailed.  At the risk of
seeming inappropriately pushy, may I say that I would GREATLY
appreciated authors who send me offprints, hard copy or e-mail
versions just fine. There are some time constraints, so speed
would be much appreciated.

Thus far the following names have come to my attention as having
published in this area:

Jeff Foss,  Don Ross,  Evan Thomson,  William Seager,  David L.
Thomson,  Bill Demopoulos,  Ausonio Marras,  Zenon Pylyshyn,
Edward Stabler,  Jeffrey Pelletier, Robert Hadley.

If you know of or have a name NOT on this list, could you please
get in touch with me, either by e-mail or by phone, as soon as
possible.

As part of the article, if there it seems that there is something
to report, I would like to include a description of any
programmes at Canadian universities which be said to provide for
graduates a substantial education in this field. SO, again,
either e-mail or phone on this.

Thanks for your help on this.

ISSCO ("Istituto Dalle Molle per gli Studi Semantici e Cognitivi")
was established in 1972 in Lugano (Switzerland) by the Fondazione
Dalle Molle, a private, non-profit organization concerned with modern
technology and its applications.  Since 1976, ISSCO has been attached
to the University of Geneva, and has links with the Department of
Computer Science, the Faculty of Arts, and the School of Translation
and Interpretation.

Research at ISSCO has concentrated on various aspects of Artificial
Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.  Machine Translation
and, more generally, multi-lingual tools are a special interest to the
research team.

The SwAN-21 symposium is organized to mark the 21st anniversary of
ISSCO's founding; past and present researchers of the Institute will
present their work, research and concerns in the field of AI and NLP.

		*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&


The 1993 IJCAI conference will take place the previous week in
Chambery, which is approximately one hour from Geneva by car or train
Intending participants may wish to take advantage of the temporal and

                Speech and Natural Language
                        at the
        University of Sheffield Department of Computer Science

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield
in England now has a strong research program in speech and natur-
al language processing, and would still welcome new graduate stu-
dents  for Fall 1993, although all scholarships for this year are
now  gone.   Sheffield  is  specifically  interested  in  Natural
Language  Engineering  and  has established a Centre for Language
Engineering involving a number of  Departments.   The  University
also  has an interdisciplinary program in Cognitive Science and a
strong program in Japanese.  Sheffield has  a  number  of  funded
projects  in  speech  and  language processing. Such projects are
funded by SERC, the European Community and  Japanese and American
funders. It is believed that we will soon receive a Human Capital
and Mobility (HCM)  award  for  research  in  speech  processing.
There are at least 15 staff in the Department of Computer Science
involved in  speech  and  language  processing.  The  Centre  for
language  Engineering  brings  in  another  10  staff.  We have a
wealth of experience in speech and language processing as well as
computer aided language learning.

Goy Brown:
auditory models, sound source separation, audition, speech

Martin Cooke:
auditory models, sound source separation, audition, speech

Malcolm Crawford
auditory models, sound source separation, audition, speech

Robert Gaizauskas

parsing

Yorick Wilks: Artificial intelligence, natural language
understanding, belief pragmatics, lexical computation,
parsing, text extraction.

Sheila Williams:
phenology, pragmatics and intonation, hearing, speech processing


The developing programme in natural language processing will seek
to  link  to  speech research and also to emphasise multi-lingual
text processing applications, pragmatics-based models  of  belief
applied  to  dialogue,  applications  of  large scale lexical and
corpus resources, text correcting and verifying systems,  includ-
ing  intelligent  teaching  systems  concerned with language, and
computational models of metaphor.  The growing  Computer  Science
Department  is housed in a new building and has excellent facili-
ties. Sheffield has the best and closest surrounding  countryside
of any major city in the UK: a good city for walkers, runners, 
limbers etc. as wellas normal people. Anyone interested in further
information should contact yorick@dcs.shef.ac.uk. Applications and

Staff for New Research Project
  
  The University have been awarded an ODA contract to develop generic
  decision support systems to improve the control of livestock diseases in
  developing countries.  This work is being undertaken on behalf of ILRAD
  (International Laboratory   for Research on Animal Diseases, Nairobi).  
  The aim of this research is to integrate and present factual information
  through hypertext technology, expert knowledge and predictive mathematical
  models of disease.  A team of two senior research scientists are to be
  appointed for a period of up to three years.
  
  
Senior Mathematical Modeller/Epidemiologist
  
  This person will be responsible for assessing existing mathematical models
  and developing new models of vector-borne diseases.  He/she will be
  involved in the identification and construction of databases suitable for
  use with the models.  It is expected that model development will take place
  in a modular form suitable for integration within the decision support
  system.

  It is expected that candidates will be qualified to MSc/PhD level in the
  mathematical sciences and/or biological sciences and/or epidemiology, and
  have an interest in tropical diseases.  Experience of working with
  databases and applying models to disease systems would be beneficial.
  
  
Senior Information Scientist
  
  This person will be responsible for the design and construction of an
  integrative framework within which the models developed can be placed. 
  This framework must also be able to integrate literature and hypertextual
  databases and expert system modules.  She/he will work with domain
  specialists to acquire knowledge and develop expert systems to incorporate
  this knowledge.
  
  It is expected that candidates will be qualified to MSc/PhD level in
  information or computing science.  While specific expertise in working with
  expert systems and hypertext would be useful, candidates with experience of
  designing and constructing integrative systems would be particularly
  welcome.
  
The appointments will be based at the University of Strathclyde under the
supervision of Prof. G. Gettinby and C. Revie.  It is expected that the
appointees will spend up to 6 months per year working with scientists at
ILRAD in Nairobi, Kenya.

        THIRD GOLDEN WEST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
                ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
                 2, 3, 4 JUNE 1994
                     LAS VEGAS

The third Golden West Int'l Conf. on Intelligent Systems
will be held in Las Vegas. All aspects of intelligent
systems are applicable, including logic programming,
knowledge based systems, neural networks, genetic
algorithms, machine learning, self-organizing and
adaptive systems, etc., both theory and applications.
Send extended abstracts to Angelo Yfantis, CS Dept.,
UNLV, Las Vegas, NV 89154 (yfantis@cs.unlv.edu). For
further information, contact Carl Looney, CS Dept.,
UNR, Reno, NV 89557 (Looney@cs.unr.edu). 

The cost of flights to Las Vegas are low, as are the
hotel rates at that time of year. The conference is
now well established, having been held twice before
with papers from Europe, Asia, and North America. Past
featured speakers were Lotfi Zadeh (fuzzy sets and logic) and
Barbara Hayes-Roth (blackboard systems). We will have
another internationally known featured speaker on
June 3, 1994. International participants are especially
welcome, as well as those from the US.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would also like to bring the SIGART in on this conference, if possible. It
appears that interest in the classical AI has been evolving to a current state
of interest in rather different topics, e.g., genetic algorithms, neural
networks, fuzzy rule-based systems, rule-learning systems, etc. My personal
opinion is, as a member of SIGART, that we should bring try to attract more
people to SIGART who have interest in some of these newer approaches.

But whether you agree or not with that opinion, I thank you for publishing
our notice in the next few issues of SIGART Bulletin.

Cordially,

  -- Carl   [Looney@cs.unr.edu]

T O P I C S  O F  I N T E R E S T 

You are invited to submit an original research paper that represents a
significant contribution to any aspect of AI, including the principles
underlying cognition, perception, and action in humans and machines;
the design, application, and evaluation of AI algorithms and
intelligent systems; and the analysis of tasks and domains in which
intelligent systems perform. Theoretical and experimental results are
equally welcome. Papers describing innovative ideas are especially
sought providing such papers include substantial analysis of the
ideas, the technology needed to realize them, and their potential
impact.

Of special interest this year are papers which address applied AI. Two
kinds of papers are sought. The first category is case studies of AI
applications that address significant real-world problems and which
are used outside the AI community itself; these papers must justify
the use of the AI technique, explain how the AI technology contributed
to the solution and was integrated with other components, and most
importantly explain WHY the application was successful (or perhaps why
it failed) -- these "lessons learned" will be the most important
review criteria. The second category is for papers on novel AI
techniques and principles that may enable more ambitious real-world
applications. All the usual AI topics are appropriate. These papers
must describe the importance of the approach from an applications
context, in sufficient technical detail and clarity, and clearly and
thoroughly differentiate the work from previous efforts. There will be
special prizes for the best papers in both these areas.




S U B M I S S I O N  O F  P A P E R S

Authors are requested to submit to the Programme Chairperson 5 copies
of papers written in English in hardcopy format (electronic and fax
submissions will not be accepted).

Each submitted paper must conform to the following specifications.
Papers should be no longer than 5500 words including references. (Each
full page of figures counts as 1100 words.) Papers longer than this
limit risk being rejected without refereeing. A separate title page
should include the title, the name(s) of the author(s), complete
address(es), email, fax and telephone numbers, the specification of
between one and four Content Areas, preferably chosen from the list
below and an abstract (maximum 200 words). The title page should also
contain a declaration that the paper is unpublished, original work,
substantially different from papers currently under review and will
not be submitted elsewhere before the notification date other than to
workshops and similar specialized presentations with a very limited
audience. Papers should be printed on A4 or 8.5"x11" sized paper in
letter quality print, with 12 point type (10 chars/inch on a
typewriter), single spaced. Double sided printing is preferred.

accompanied by a submission letter that includes:
* Title
* Full names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of
all authors
* Duration of tape in minutes
* Three copies of an abstract of one to two pages in length,
containing the title of the video, and full names and addresses of the
authors
* Author's permission to copy tape for review purposes

The timetable and conditions for submission, notification of
acceptance or rejection, and receipt of final version are the same as
for the paper track. All videotape submissions must be made to the
Programme Chair. Tapes cannot be returned; authors should retain
extra copies for making revisions. All videos must be in VHS-PAL
format. An e-mail message giving the title, author, address and
abstract should be e-mailed to ecai94-video@scs.leeds.ac.uk (unless
the submitter has no e-mail access in which case this condition is
waived).

Tapes will be reviewed and selected for presentation during the
conference. The following criteria will guide the selection:

          Level of interest to the conference audience
 
          Clarity of goals, methods and results
 
          Presentation quality (including audio, video and pace).

Preference will be given to applications that show a high level of
maturity. Tapes that are deemed to be advertising commercial products,
propaganda, purely expository materials, merely taped lectures or
other material not of scientific or technical value will be rejec-
ted.

A full workshop programme is planned for ECAI '94. These will take
place in the two days immediately before the main technical
conference, i.e., on August 8 and 9, 1994. Workshops may last for
either 1 or 2 days.

They will give participants the opportunity to discuss specific
technical topics in a small, informal environment, which encourages
interaction and exchange of ideas. Workshops may address any topic
covered by the list of areas given above [i.e., in the general call
for papers]. Workshops on applications and related issues are
especially welcome. Workshop proposals should be in the form of a
draft call for participation containing a brief description of the
workshop and the technical issues to be addressed, the proposed format
and the kind of contributions solicited, and the names and addresses
(postal, phone, fax, e-mail) of the organizing committee of the
workshop. Additionally, proposals should specify the number of
expected participants and some names of some potential participants.
Proposers are encouraged to send their draft proposal to potential
participants for comments before submission.

The organizers of accepted workshops are responsible for producing a
call for participation, for reviewing requests to participate and
for scheduling the workshop activities within the constraints set by
the conference organizers.

Workshop proposals should be sent to the Workshop Chairpersons as soon
as possible, but not later than November 1, 1993. Electronic
submission (plain ascii text) is highly preferred, but hard copy
submission is also accepted in which case 5 copies should be
submitted. Proposals should not exceed 2 sides of A4 (i.e.,
approximately 120 lines of text). The proposals will be reviewed by
the Programme Committee and the organizers will be notified not later
than December 31, 1993.

Details of all accepted workshops will be available by anonymous FTP
from cs.vu.nl, directory ECAI94 by January 31, 1994; alternatively
send electronic mail to ecai94-workshops@cs.vu.nl. It should be
noted that registration for the main conference will be required in
order to attend an ECAI '94 workshop.

The ECAI '94 Organizing Committee invites proposals for the Tutorial
Programme for ECAI '94. The tutorials will take place on August 8 and
9, 1994. Anyone who is interested in presenting a tutorial, or who has
suggestions concerning possible speakers or topics is invited to
contact the Tutorial Chair.

A list of suggested topics that may be covered by tutorials is given
below, but the list is only a guide. Other topics, both related to
these and quite different from them, will be considered:

Model-based reasoning; Natural language processing; Real-time
reasoning; AI & databases (deductive databases, integrity
constraints); Distributed AI, multi-agent systems; AI in industry
(banking, networking, engineering); Knowledge sharing and reuse;
Machine learning; Neutral Networks; Probabilistic reasoning and
uncertainty; Genetic algorithms; Case-based reasoning; KBS design
and methodology (including knowledge acquisition); Planning and
scheduling; Hypermedia/multi-media in AI

We are interested in:

Proposals for the tutorials to be presented at the ECAI '94
Suggestions for topics (either an expression of interest in any of the
topics above or in other topics)
Suggestions for possible speakers for the tutorials (who would you
like to hear if you attend a tutorial?)

Anyone interested in presenting a tutorial should submit a proposal
containing the following information:
* A brief description and outline of the tutorial
* The necessary background and the potential target audience
* A description of why the tutorial topic is of interest to the ECAI
'94 audience
* A brief resume of the presenters

Each tutorial will last for four hours, and must be offered by a team
of presenters (usually two people, possibly three). Those submitting a
proposal should keep in mind that tutorials are intented to provide an
overview of a field or practical training in an area. They should
present reasonably well agreed upon information in a balanced way.
Tutorials should not be used to advocate a single avenue of research,
nor should they promote a product. Presenters of a tutorial will
receive a remuneration based on the number of participants in the
tutorial.

Proposals and suggestions must be received by September 1, 1993.
Decisions about the tutorial programme will be made by September 30,
1993. Speakers should be prepared to submit completed course materials
by May 6, 1994.

Proposals, suggestions and enquiries should be sent (preferably
electronically) to:

Subject: CFP: Florida AI Research Symposium



                      ***** CALL FOR PAPERS *****

                     Florida AI Research Symposium

                       Pensacola Beach, Florida

                             May 5-7, 1994

The Seventh Annual Florida AI Research Symposium seeks high quality
international submissions in all areas of AI. We are especially interested
in papers describing knowledge-based approaches to the construction of
intelligent systems. We construe a system to be "knowledge-based" when its
behavior depends largely on accessed or encoded information. The symposium
will strive for a balance between theory and practice. All accepted papers
will appear in the conference proceedings. Selected papers will appear in a
post-proceedings volume published by JAI Press. In addition, a small number
of papers will be selected for revision and publication in a special issue
of the International Journal of Expert Systems: Research and Applications.

Submission of Papers

Authors must submit 6 copies of an extended abstract of 1200 to 1600 words.
Include a single copy of a cover page containing the author's name(s),
address, phone number, affiliation, paper title, and topic area. In case of
multiple authors, all correspondence will be sent to the first author
unless otherwise requested. The abstract must be placed on a separate
page(s) from the cover page and must include the paper title and topic
area. The abstract page(s) must not identify the author or affiliation in
any manner.
Abstracts must be received by October 18, 1993. Abstracts received after
this date will not be considered. The Program Committee's decisions will be
mailed during December of 1993. Authors of accepted papers will be expected
to submit their final camera-ready copy of their full papers by February
14, 1994. Final papers must consist of at most 5 galley pages
(approximately 10 double spaced pages). A reduced registration rate will be
provided to all authors.
