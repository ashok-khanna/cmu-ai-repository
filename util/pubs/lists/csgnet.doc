OUR SUBJECT: PERCEPTUAL CONTROL THEORY

Here are two introductions by Bill and Mary Powers:

  There have been two paradigms in the behavioral sciences since
  the 1600's. One was the idea that events impinging on
  organisms make them behave as they do. The other, which was
  developed in the 1930's, is PERCEPTUAL CONTROL THEORY (PCT).
  Perceptual Control Theory explains how organisms control what
  happens to them. This means all organisms from the amoeba to
  humankind. It explains why one organism can't control another
  without physical violence. It explains why people deprived of
  any major part of their ability to control soon become
  dysfunctional, lose interest in life, pine away and die. It
  explains what a goal is, how goals relate to action, how
  action affects perceptions and how perceptions define the
  reality in which we live and move and have our being.
  Perceptual Control Theory is the first scientific theory that
  can handle all these phenomena within a single, testable
  concept of how living systems work.

                      William T. Powers, November 3, 1991

  PERCEPTUAL CONTROL THEORY

  While the existence of control mechanisms and processes (such
  as feedback) in living systems is generally recognized, the
  implications of control organization go far beyond what is
  generally accepted. We believe that a fundamental
  characteristic of organisms is their ability to control; that
  they are, in fact, living control systems. To distinguish this
  approach from others using some version of control theory but
  forcing it to fit conventional approaches, we call ours
  Perceptual Control Theory, or PCT.

  PCT requires a major shift in thinking from the traditional
  approach: that what is controlled is not behavior, but
  perception. Modelling behavior as a dependent variable, as a
  response to stimuli, provides no explanation for the
  phenomenon of achieving consistent ends through varying means,
  and requires an extensive use of statistics to achieve modest
  (to the point of meaningless) correlations. Attempts to model
  behavior as planned and computed output can be demonstrated to
  require levels of precise calculation that are unobtainable in
  a physical system, and impossible in a real environment that
  is changing from one moment to the next. The PCT model views
  behavior as the means by which a perceived state of affairs is
  brought to and maintained at a reference state. This approach
  provides a physically plausible explanation for the
  consistency of outcomes and the variability of means.

  The PCT model has been used to simulate phenomena as diverse
  as bacterial chemotaxis, tracking a target, and behavior in
  crowds. In its elaborated form, a hierarchy of perceptual
  control systems (HPCT), it has lent itself to a computer
  simulation of tracking, including learning to track, and to
  new approaches to education, management, and psychotherapy.

  Control systems are not new in the life sciences. However,
  numerous misapprehensions exist, passed down from what was
  learned about control theory by non-engineers 40 or 50 years
  ago without further reference to newer developments or
  correction of initial misunderstandings. References in the
  literature to the desirability of positive feedback and the
  assertion that systems with feedback are slower than S-R
  systems are simply false, and concerns about stability are
  unfounded.

  The primary barrier to the adoption of PCT concepts is the
  belief - or hope - that control theory can simply be absorbed
  into the mainstream life sciences without disturbing the
  status quo. It is very hard to believe that one's training and
  life work, and that of one's mentors, and their mentors, must
  be fundamentally revised. Therefore, PCT appeals to those who
  feel some dissatisfaction with the status quo, or who are
  attracted to the idea of a generative model with broad
  application throughout the life sciences (plus AI and
  robotics). There are very few people working in PCT research.
  Much of its promise is still simply promise, and it meets
  resistance from all sides. It is frustrating but also
  tremendously exciting to be a part of the group who believe
  that they are participating in the birth of a true science of
  life.
                        Mary Powers, November 1992


THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONTROL PARADIGM

The PCT paradigm originates in 1927, when an engineer named
Harold Black recognized and clearly described a closed loop
control system as a special kind of mechanism. He was working
with the negative feedback amplifier, which is a control device.
This led to a new engineering discipline and the development
of many purposeful machines. Purposeful machines have built-in
intent to achieve consistent ends by variable means under
changing conditions.

The discovery and formalization of the phenomenon of control is
the first alternative to the cause-effect perspective ever
proposed in any science.

The first discussion of purposeful machines and people came in
1943 in a paper called:  Behavior, Purpose and Teleology by
Rosenblueth, Wiener and Bigelow. This paper also argued that
purpose belongs in science as a real phenomenon in the present.
Purpose does not mean that somehow the future influences the
present.

The first specific suggestion on how to use the concept of
control to understand people came in 1957 in a paper entitled:
A General Feedback Theory of Human Behavior by McFarland, Powers
and Clark.

In 1973 William T. (Bill) Powers published a seminal book called
"Behavior: the Control of Perception," which still is the major
reference for PCT. See literature below.

This book spells out a complete model of how the human brain and
nervous system works like a living perceptual control system.
Our brain can be viewed as a system that controls its own
perceptions. This view suggests explanations for many previously
mysterious aspects of how people interact with their world.

Perceptual Control Theory has been accepted by independently
thinking psychologists, scientists and other interested people.
The result is that an association has been formed (the Control
System Group), several books published, this CSGnet set up and
that at latest count 16 professors are teaching PCT in American
universities today.


DEMONSTRATING THE PHENOMENON OF CONTROL

The phenomenon of control is largely unrecognized in science
today. It is not well understood in important aspects even by
many control engineers. Yet the phenomenon of control, when it
is recognized and understood, provides a powerful enhancement to
scientific perspectives.

It is essential to recognize that this phenomenon exists and
deserves an explanation before any of the discourse on CSGnet
will make sense.

Please download the introductory demonstration dem1a.exe, which
is an interactive program and/or rubberbd.txt, which is a text
telling you how to demonstrate the phenomenon to yourself and a
friend using only two rubber bands.


THE PURPOSE OF CSGnet:

CSGnet provides a forum for development, use and testing of PCT.


CSGnet PARTICIPANTS

Many interests and backgrounds are represented here. Psychology,
Sociology, Linguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics,
Social Work, Neurology, Modeling and Testing. All are
represented and discussed.  As of May 1993 there were
about 140 individuals from 19 countries subscribed to CSGnet.


ASKING QUESTIONS

Please introduce yourself with a statement of your professional
interests and background. It will help someone answer if you
spell out which demonstrations, introductory papers and
references you have taken the time to digest.


THE CONTROL SYSTEMS GROUP

The CSG is an organization of people in the behavioral, social,
and life sciences who see the potential in PCT for increased
understanding in their own fields and for the unification of
diverse and fragmented specialties.

Annual dues are $45 for full members and $5 for students
(subsidized).

The tenth North American annual meeting of the CSG will held in
Durango, Colorado, on the campus of Fort Lewis College. It will
be held 27-31 July 1994. There will be 7 plenary meetings
(mornings and evenings), with afternoons, mealtimes, and late
night free for further discussion or recreation. Full details
will be available on CSGnet or by mail after April 1, 1994.
 
The first meeting of the European Control Systems Group (ECSG)
will be held on 22-26 June 1994, in Aberystwyth, Wales, UK.
Further information can be obtained from Marcos Rodrigues
<mar@aber.ac.uk>.

Net subscribers find it useful to have thematic collections of
some of the network discussions, and it enables non-net members
to keep up with them. Threads from this net are published on a
quarterly basis in a booklet called the Closed Loop. These
booklets, distributed to members, are available separately.
A complimentary copy of Closed Loop will be sent upon request.
Back issues are available: Volume 1 (4 issues) is $12. Single
issues of Volume 2, beginning with Jan. 1992, are $6 each.

For membership information and back issues of Closed Loop,
write: CSG, c/o Mary Powers, 73 Ridge Place CR 510, Durango, CO
81301-8136.

SUBSCRIBING TO CSGnet

When you subscribe to CSGnet, you get this message,
CSGINTRO.DOC. But you may have received it from a friend who
printed it, seen it on a demodisk, or seen it on Usenet. To
subscribe, send a message as follows: (Internet address followed
by two message commands, one per line)

  LISTSERV@VMD.CSO.UIUC.EDU
  Subscribe CSG-L Lastname, Firstname, Affiliation, City, State.
  help

(Lastname, Firstname, etc is optional commentary, but helpful).
("help" requests a list of most commonly used commands).
(The Bitnet address is:  LISTSERV@UIUCVMD).

HOW TO OBTAIN TEXT AND PROGRAM FILES

A number of ASCII documents and binary computer programs are
available on a fileserver maintained by Bill Silvert. It is
possible to download all these files via e-mail. If you are on
internet, it is easiest to obtain binary program files via
anonymous FTP. If you are on MCI mail, you have read about how
you can transfer binary files with Kermit or Zmodem protocols.
(Type help at the MCI mail prompt for directions). But the
server cannot send binary files over the internet mail network,
so download uue.scr first, then request the binary files
uuencoded as ASCII files. The Internet address for the server is
BIOME.BIO.NS.CA. CSGnet files are kept in the subdirectory
pub/csg.

To get basic information and a current listing of available
documents, send a message as follows: (Internet)

To:         SERVER@BIOME.BIO.NS.CA

Commands:   help
            ftp
            get csg/Index
            end

"help"            requests commands and explanations.
"ftp"             asks details on anonymous FTP for internet.
"get csg/Index"   requests the Index for the csg subdirectory.

Pay attention to letter case for commands! DOS is not dos.

As part of the index (of the csg directory), you may be looking
at:

programs/msdos:
dem1a.exe   128437  Bill Power's demonstr of perceptual control
dem2a.exe   123649  Bill Power's modelling of control

documents/forssell:
uud.scr      53406  ASCII Compile uud.exe w DOS debug Dir @ end.

If you want dem1a.exe (uuencoded) to get a "live" demonstration
of the phenomenon of control, and the ASCII file uud.scr with
directions at the end on how to use DOS debug to compile uud.exe
to decode it, send the following message commands:

uue csg/programs/msdos/dem1a.exe
get csg/programs/forssell/uud.scr

The uuencoded dem1a.exe will be sent in four parts. Remove
headers and use an editor to make it into one file (starting
with table and ending with end) before you use uud.exe to
restore the file. dem1a.exe is a self-extracting archive file.
Put it in it's own directory before you execute it. You get
complete documentation and a running program.
