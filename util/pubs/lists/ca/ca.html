You have been added to the Cellular Automata (CA) mailing list.  The
archives are kept in the files mail/ca.archive* at think.com.  You can FTP
them using Anonymous login if you are on the Internet.

Mail sent to "cellular-automata@think.com" will automatically be
forwarded to everyone on the list.  All requests for additions, changes,
or deletions should be sent to "cellular-automata-request@think.com".

This mailing list is open to discussion of any Cellular Automata topics.

If you encounter invalid addresses in the list when you broadcast a
message, forward the returned mail to me so I can keep the mailing
list as clean as possible.  Normally, however, bounced mail will be
forwarded to cellular-automata-request, and you shouldn't see any of
it.

This mailing-list is connected bidirectionally to the Usenet newsgroup
"comp.theory.cell-automata".  Messages that appear on one are automatically
forwarded to the other.  Thus, you may use whichever medium you are
most comfortable with, to read and participate in the list.
