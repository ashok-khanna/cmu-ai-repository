 	This is the long (122 line) version of the CFP.  It is

            CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:  STUDENTS.CHI@XEROX.COM
          -------------------------------------------------
 You are invited to participate in STUDENTS.CHI.  The SIGCHI Extended 
 Executive Committee (EEC) and Xerox (the corporate sponsor of the CHI 
 email distribution lists) have approved the creation of STUDENTS.CHI as 
 a new distribution channel within the HCI community:  Any comments 
 sent to "STUDENTS.CHI@XEROX.COM" will be distributed free of charge to 
 all of the other participants.
 
 The objective of STUDENTS.CHI is to distribute information and 
 share perspectives of particular concern to students involved in any 
 aspect of the human factors and computing field.  The Human-Computer 
 Interaction field (HCI) focuses on the research, design, development and 
 evaluation of human-computer communication and interaction.   
 
 The students involved in human factors and computing represent a unique 
 multidisciplinary and multicultural group.  Some of the disciplines 
 included are Anthropology, Architecture, Art, Computer Science, Cognitive 
 Science, Design, Economics, Education, Engineering, Human Factors, 
 Information Sciences, Mathematics, Media Studies, Physics, and Psychology.  
 Participants come from all continents, except Antarctica.
 
 Traditionally, conferences have provided the only opportunity for "HCI" 
 students to share information with other students.  Although there are now 
 a number of these in North America and in Europe (CHI, Interact, UIST, CSCW, 
 ECSCW, IWIUI, HCI international, BCS HCI  and OZCHI) the cost of attending
 is prohibitive, and only a small percentage of students can afford to go 
 to these conferences.  The STUDENTS.CHI list will be an alternative 
 means of sharing information and perspectives.
 
 Some of the specific goals of STUDENTS.CHI for the next year will be:
 
 1.  To distribute information of particular concern to students and 
 the human factors and computing field.  This information will include:  
 
 	*  Calls for student volunteers
 	*  Information on available funding and scholarships
 	*  Information regarding university HCI programs
	*  Lists of theses and dissertations in progress
 	
 2.  To serve as a forum for students to share ideas about methods and 
 practices within HCI.  Graduate students are often working toward the 
 completion of a project or a thesis.  Waiting until the next HCI 
 conference to talk to other students who may be working on the same 
 ideas is often not convenient or possible.  STUDENTS.CHI could also 
 serve as a intermediate posting for experimental results, as well as a 
 means of distributing abstracts from recently finished dissertations.  
 Students can also use the list to locate other students working on particular 
 topics and to find out about available resources within the HCI community.
 
 3.  To foster a greater understanding of the complexity of human 
 computer interaction through increased communication.  No one 
 discipline or culture holds the "key" to HCI, and an understanding of 
 the interrelationships and incompatibilities of the many disciplines 
 and cultures involved in CHI should result in better research and 
 products.  
 
 Students are also reminded of the other distribution lists that ACM 
 SIGCHI and Xerox maintain. Lists offering information and announcements 
 relevant to CHI as well as discussion on a wide variety of topics are 
 open to all students.  Of particular interest to you might be:
 
 Lists not maintained by Xerox:
 --------------------------------------
 educators.chi           Discussion of education in HCI issues
 ii.chi                  Messages related to intelligent interfaces
 
 Lists maintained by Xerox:
 ---------------------------------
 announcements.chi       Broadcasts messages of general interest
 intercultural.chi       Cross-cultural issues and SIGCHI
 socialaction.chi        Discussion of CHI-related Social Issues
 students.chi            Issues related to students in HCI
 techprogram.chi         Long range planning of CHI conf. program
 vision.chi              Discussions related to the future of SIGCHI
 
 As a final note:  Please try and enroll into STUDENTS.CHI (and all of 
 the other CHI lists maintained at Xerox.com) with a permanent email 
 address.  If a large percentage of students enroll with addresses that 
 change every semester then it will overwhelm the list manager at Xerox. 
 Many schools give students computer (and email) access only when enrolled 
 in a computer/information science course. Some system administrators 
 will allow students that can demonstrate need to have more permanent 
 computer accounts.  You may want to ask a faculty member for guidance.
