% 
% This is a LaTeX document style for articles to be published in the
% journal of Lisp and Symbolic Computation (LASC), published by Kluwer
% Academic Publishers. It was written by Hassan Ait-Kaci, at MCC in
% Austin, TX (hassan@mcc.com) following specifications and samples sent
% by LASC editor Jan Zubkoff. It is meant to make life easy to the
% authors by providing some high level commands necessary to declare such
% things as title, author name, etc., without worrying about how Kluwer
% wants LASC article to look. All that the authors have to do is prepare
% their manuscript in LaTeX as follows.
% 
% The file must specify:
% 
% 	\documentsyle{kluwer}
% 
% NO ALTERATION OF PAGE LAYOUT MAY BE MADE. DO NOT SPECIFY ANY HEADINGS.
% Immediately following the
% 
% 	\begin{document}
% 
% line, use the following commands (those marked with a * are optional
% and may be omitted) followed by the command \preamble:
% 
% 	\title{...}		the title of the article
% (*)	\titlenote{...}		footnote for the title
% 	\runningtitle{...}	the running title if different from the title
% 				because title is too long to fit on top of odd pages
% 	\author{...}		one author's name
%	\runningauthor{...}	Person's name on top of even pages or last
%				names only on co-authors 
% (*)	\thanks{...}		last author's thanks (for support, etc...)
% (*)	\email{...}		last author's electronic mail address
% (*)	\address{...}		last author's street address
% 				(the \thanks, \email, and \address commands
%				refer to the last specified \author)
%	\runningauthor{...}	for 2 or more authors last name and last name
% (*)	\keywords{...}		key words and phrases dealt with in article
% (*)	\draft			marks the manuscript foot with ``Draft of ...''
%
% Following these commands the command:
% 
% 	\preamble
% 
% will put everything into place.  In addition to the name, title, etc.,
% if known to the authors the following can be defined before the
% \preamble command (more probably, these command are to be inserted by
% the editor upon final acceptance and when all details of the issue of
% LASC in which the article is to appear are finalized):
% 
% (*)	\startingpage{...}	the number of the first page (MUST BE ODD)
% (*)	\endingpage{...}	the number of the last page
% (*)	\volume{...}		the number of the LASC volume
% (*)	\pubyear{...}		the year of publication
% 
% The last one defaults to the current year.
% 
% After \preamble, give the abstract as follows:
% 
% 	\begin{abstract}
% 	...
% 	\end{abstract}
% 
% and start the text of your article using all regular LaTeX section and
% other commands. A proof environment has been added so that
% 
% 	\begin{proof}
% 	...
% 	\end{proof}
% 
% following theorems, lemmas, etc., will do the necessary thing.
% 
% If the article contains bibliographical references use:
% 
% 	\bibliographystyle{plain}
% 	\bibliography{<your-file-name>}
% 
% right before the \end{document} line at the end of your file. This is
% intended to be used in conjunction with BiBTeX using the particular
% bibliography style of Kluwer Pubs. A kluwer.bst file is supplied along
% with this kluwer.sty file for this purpose. Refer to the LaTeX
% manual for information on how to use BiBTeX. We provide the command
% \uml{...} equivalent to \"{...} (putting a dieresis on the argument)
% to use in a *.bib file to avoid problems of it being confused with the
% string quote " of BiBTeX.
%
% or include the bibliography in the file itself by typing the following
% at the end of the paper and before \end{document}
%\bibliography{kluwer}
%\begin{thebibliography}{10}
%
% result should be:
% \bibitem{Unknown} Unknown.
% \newblock {\sl Multi-Paradigm Research: A Survey of Nine Projects}.
% \newblock IEEE Software, Vol. 3, No. 1 (1986), 70--77.
