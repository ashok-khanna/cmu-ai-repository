AIMS AND SCOPE

Real-time systems are defined as those systems in which the
correctness of the system depends not only on the logical result of
computation, but also on the time at which the results are produced.
The journal Real-Time Systems publishes papers that concentrate
on real-time computing principles and applications. Real-Time
Systems publishes research papers, invited papers, project reports
and case studies, standards and corresponding proposals for general
discussion, and a partitioned tutorial on real-time systems as a
continuing series. Much of the work in building sophisticated, modern
real-time systems is interdisciplinary in nature and, up until now,
has been found scattered throughout the primary literature.
Real-Time Systems provides a single-source coverage of the state
of the art in this exciting and expanding field. The editorial board,
the writers and the readers of the journal are drawn from all parts of
the world, from industry, and from academe.

Papers published in Real-Time Systems cover the following
topics, among others:
requirements engineering, specification and verification techniques,
design methods and tools, programming languages, operating systems,
scheduling algorithms, architecture and hardware (especially
interfacing), fault tolerance, distributed and other novel
architectures, communications, distributed databases, AI, expert
systems, and application case studies. Applications are found in
command and control systems, process control systems, automated
manufacturing, flight control, avionics, space avionics and defense
systems, shipborne systems, vision and robotics, and robot teams in
hazardous environments.

`Real-Time Systems does what its title suggests, which is
to provide a welcome service in drawing together material that
is otherwise not easy to find in one place. Real-Time Systems
has a good chance of being the main focus in print for the
future development of its subject; both developers and users
stand to benefit from reading it.'

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original works
which have not appeared, nor are under consideration, in other
journals.  Papers which have previously appeared in conference
proceedings will also be considered, and this should be so
indicated at the time of submission.

1.  Authors should submit five hard copies of their final
manuscript to the editor-in-chief for the author's region, at the
following addresses:

FAX: 81-44-63-3421
Network: CSNET IN%"mario%sulu.keio.junet%utokyo-
relay.csnet@relay.cs.net"


2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from five
to ten index terms (key phrases).

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below. Alternatively, good quality copies may be sent
initially, with the originals ready to be sent immediately upon
acceptance of paper.

4.  Upon acceptance of the paper, authors must supply a
photograph and brief biographical sketch.

5.  Enclose a separate page giving your complete preferred
mailing address (including street and bldg. nos.) for
correspondence and return of proofs.  Please be sure to include
your telephone number and e-mail address.

6.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

7.  Papers exceeding 40 pages in length (including figures) may
be returned to the author for shortening.

8.  All papers should be written in English.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Provide an informative 100 to 250 word abstract at the head
of the manuscript.  The abstracts are printed with the articles. 

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered references.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper in alphabetical order with items referred to in
the text by author and date of publication in parentheses, e.g.,
(Marr 1982). References should be complete, in the following
style:

Style for papers: Authors, last name followed by first initials,
year of publication, title, volume, inclusive page numbers.

Style for books: Authors, year of publication, title, publisher
and location, chapter and page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

(Book) Marr, D. 1982. Vision, a Computational Investigation into
the Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information, San
Francisco: Freeman.

(Journal Article) Rosenfeld, A., and Thurston, M. 1971. Edge and
curve detection for visual scene analysis. IEEE Trans. Comput. C-
20: 562-569.

(Conference Proceedings) Witkin, A. 1983. Scales space filtering.
Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell., Karlsruhe, West Germany,
pp. 1019-1021.

(Lab. memo.) Yuille, A.L. and Poggio, T. 1983. Scaling theorems
for zero crossings.  M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab., Massachusetts
Inst. Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo. 722.

5.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
zero crossings of the second derivative of the (a) Gaussian and
(b) sine filter for the same input function."

6.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as it should appear in
print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service. All original illustrations should be placed on
separate pages following the text, not within the manuscript
text.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back, or at the bottom of the
front.

8.  Include a separate page listing the captions for all figures.

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the first named author for proofing.  The proofread
copy should be received back by the Publisher within 72 hours.

COPYRIGHT

Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be required to sign a
copyright form  transferring the copyright from the authors or
their employers to the publisher.

REPRINTS

First-named authors will be entitled to 25 free reprints of their
paper.  Additional reprints may be ordered from the Publisher
prior to publication.  An order form will be sent to authors with
page proofs.
