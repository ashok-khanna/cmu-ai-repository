INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Artificial Intelligence and Law (AILJ) constitutes an international forum
for the dissemination of original interdisciplinary research in the
following areas:

A. Theoretical or empirical studies in artificial intelligence, cognitive
psychology, jurisprudence, linguistics, or philosophy which address the
development of formal or computational models of legal knowledge,
reasoning, and decision making.
B. In-depth studies of innovative artificial intelligence systems that are
being used in the legal domain.
C. Studies which address the ethical and social implications of the field
of Artificial Intelligence and Law.

In addition to original research contributions, the journal will include a
Book Review section, and a series of Technology Reports describing
existing and emerging products, applications, and technologies.

Five copies of the manuscript should be sent to either: Artificial
Intelligence and Law, P.O. Box 230, Accord, MA 02018-0230, U.S.A.; or
Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Editorial Office, Artificial Intelligence
and Law, P.O. Box 17, 3300 AA Dordrecht, The Netherlands.

Manuscripts should be typewritten on 8 1/2" x 11" bond paper, one side
only, leaving 1" margins on all sides. Please double-space all materials,
including footnotes, endnotes, and references. Number pages consecutively
with the first page containing the title, the authors, the affiliation,
and a short abstract of 100 to 250 words. Quoted passages of more than 40
words should be set off from the text by indenting the left-hand margin
five spaces.

Explanatory footnotes should be used sparingly and indicated by
consecutive superscript numbers in the text. Footnotes should appear at
the end of the document in the manuscript, and will appear at the foot of
the page in the printed version.

In tables, footnotes are preferable to long explanatory material in either
the heading or body of the table. Such explanatory footnotes identified in
superscript letters should be placed under the table.

References to books, journal papers, articles in collections and
proceedings, and technical reports should be collected in a list at the
end of the paper and listed in alphabetical order.

References to books should include the author's name; year of publication;
title in full, underline or in italics; page numbers; place of
publication; publisher.

50 Offprints of each article will be provided free of charge. Additional
offprints can be ordered when proofs are returned to the publisher. No
page charges are levied on authors or their institutions.
