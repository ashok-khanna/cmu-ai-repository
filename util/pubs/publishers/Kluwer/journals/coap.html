AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Optimization and Applications is a peer
reviewed journal that is commited to timely publication of research
and tutorial papers on the analysis and development of computational
algorithms for optimization. Algorithms either for general classes of
optimization problems or for more specific applied problems are of
interest. Papers that can provide both theoretical analysis, along
with carefully designed computational experiments, are particularly
welcome.

Topics of interest include the following:
- Large Scale Optimization
- Unconstrained Optimization
- Linear Programming
- Quadratic Programming Complementarity Problems, and Variational Inequalities
- Constrained Optimization
- Nondifferentiable Optimization
- Integer Programming
- Combinatorial Optimization
- Stochastic Optimization
- Multiobjective Optimization
- Complexity Theory
- Approximations and Error Analysis
- Automatic Differentiation
- Parametric Programming and Sensitivity Analysis
- Parallel Computing, Distributed Computing, and Vector Processing
- Software, Benchmarks, Numerical Experimentation and Comparisons
- Modelling Systems
- Network Optimization Problems
- Applications in Engineering, Finance, Optimal Control, Optimal
  Design, Operations Research, Transportation, Economics,
  Communications, Manufacturing, and Management Science.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that
has neither appeared in, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit five hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Judith A. Kemp
COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS
Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528
Norwell,  MA 02061           E-mail: jkkluwer@world.std.com

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
include a telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, if
available.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.


STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.  References in the text should be denoted
by numbers in square brackets, e.g. [12].

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper double spaced with items referred to by numerals
and put in alphabetical order.   References should be complete,
in the following style:

Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

(Book) D. Marr, Vision, A Computational Investigation into the
Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information, Freeman:
San Francisco, CA. 1982.

(Journal Article) A. Rosenfeld and M. Thurston, "Edge and curve
detection for visual scene analysis," IEEE Trans. Comput. vol. C-
20pp. 562-569, 1971.

(Conference Proceedings) A. Witkin, "Scales space filtering," in
Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell., Karlsruhe, West Germany,
1983, pp. 1019-1021.

(Lab. memo.) A.L. Yuille and T. Poggio, "Scaling theorems for
zero crossings."  M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab., Massachusetts Inst.
Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo. 722, 1983.

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the contact author for proofing, unless otherwise
informed.  The proofread copy should be received back by the
Publisher within 72 hours.
