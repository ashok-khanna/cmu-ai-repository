AIMS AND SCOPE

Advances in high performance materials for structural and
functional applications depend on the development of materials
processing which allows for the regulation of phenomena and structures
at atomic, molecular, nanoscale and micrometer scale levels. Sol-gel
processing provides such materials in an efficient manner, and
tremendous opportunities are now open for developing and producing
novel high technology materials.

The primary objective of the JOURNAL OF SOL-GEL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
is to provide an international forum for the dissemination of
scientific and technical information and knowledge about sol-gel
processed materials. The materials of interest include gels,
gel-derived glasses and ceramics in bulk, fiber, film or powder form.
Gel-processed composites of all types are also included. Optical,
electronic, magnetic, mechanical, chemical, environmental and
biomedical functions and applications of the resultant materials are
of interest.

The journal will publish original research papers and occasionally
invited overview papers on scientific and technical issues in the
emergent field of sol-gel materials.

The following are major topics of the Journal:
Chemistry, physics, materials science and technology of sol-gel
synthesis and processing; Characterization of sol-gel derived gels,
glasses, ceramics and composites; Properties, performance and
applications: optical, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, chemical,
environmental and biomedical.

Governed by an international advisory board, the Journal will serve as
an international forum for the field of sol-gel science and
technology.
