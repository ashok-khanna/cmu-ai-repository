Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory & Applications

Editor-in-Chief (+deputy)

AIMS AND SCOPE

The journal publishes high-quality, peer-reviewed papers on the
modeling and control of discrete event dynamical systems (DEDS). Such
systems are engineering and mathematical models of, for example,
manufacturing plants, communication and computer networks, management
information databases, command-control-communication systems, and
other man-made operational systems. The scope of the journal is
defined by its emphasis on the modeling of discrete events by dynamic
systems, and on problems of their control and optimization.
The development of the theory of DEDS must continuously be motivated
by concrete problems and so the journal welcomes papers describing
modeling and control problems with discrete events from all areas of
engineering and science. The term `problem' is interpreted here in a
broad sense to include not only problems from the real world but also
well-defined problems arising from a methodological context. As a
scientific and engineering discipline, DEDS must have both
experimental and theoretical components. Carefully designed
experiments accumulate evidence upon which a relevant theory can be
built. Conversely, analytical and mathematical reasoning pinpoint
further experiments to be conducted for theory validation and
extension.

The journal encourages papers which emphasize this interplay between
modeling, experimentation and mathematical theory. It is not devoted
exclusively to the mathematics of DEDS. The journal will provide a
science and engineering knowledge base for studies of DEDS.
The journal's content covers three broad areas: theory and formal
models, performance analysis and control, and applications. Within
those broad areas, papers are published specifically devoted to the
dynamics of discrete event systems, control and optimization, and the
interface with operations research and computer science.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that 
has neither appeared, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  Papers which have previously appeared in conference
proceedings will also be considered for publication, however,
this should be so indicated at the time of submission.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Karen S. Cullen
DEDS - Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528
Assinippi Park
Norwell,  MA 02061                    

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words. Some typical key word examples are: queuing
networks, perturbation analysis, min-max algebra, computer and
communication network.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper in alphabetical order with items referred to in
the text by author and date of publication in parentheses, e.g.,
(Marr 1982).  References should be complete, in the following
style:

Style for papers: Authors, last names followed by first initials,
year of publication, title, volume, inclusive page numbers.

Style for books: Authors, year of publication, title, publisher
and location, chapter and page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

(Book) Marr, D. 1982. Vision, a Computational Investigation into
the Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information, San
Francisco, Freeman.

(Journal Article) Rosenfeld, A., and Thurston, M. 1971. Edge and
curve detection for visual scene analysis. IEEE Trans. Comput. C-
20, pp. 562-569.

(Conference Proceedings) Witkin, A. 1983.  Scales space
filtering. Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell., Karlsruhe, West
Germany, pp. 1019-1021.

(Lab. memo.) Yuille, A.L. and Poggio, T.  1983.  Scaling theorems
for zero crossings,  M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab., Massachusetts
Inst. Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo. 722.

5.  Type or mark mathematical expressions exactly as they should
appear in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Original illustrations should be
submitted on separate sheets of paper following the text.  When
illustrations are shown within the text, original art must be
provided.  Illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and of good
contrast.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if possible, to
simplify handling of the manuscript. We regret that we cannot
provide drafting or art service.

2.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

3.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

4.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

5.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

6.  Number each original on the back.

7.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the contact author for proofing, unless otherwise
informed.  The proofread copy should be received at the Publisher
within 72 hours.
