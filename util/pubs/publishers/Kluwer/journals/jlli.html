Scope
The scope of the journal is the logical and computational foundations of
natural, formal and programming languages, as well as the different forms
of human and mechanized inference. It covers the logical, linguistic and
information-theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences.
Examples of main subareas are Intensional Logics including Dynamic Logic;
Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity
issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical problems of Logic Progrmaming
and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; Generalized
Quantification; Information-oriented theories of semantic structure like
Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic
Semantics; Connectionist models of Logical and linguistic structures. The
emphasis will be on the theoretical aspects of these areas.
The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers interested
in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and their
interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas
increasing coherence. It is hoped that the journal will meet a need of an
interdisciplinary community within the cognitive sciences whose most
important publications have been scattered across journals in different
areas so far.
