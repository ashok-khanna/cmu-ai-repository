AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of Supercomputing is an archival technical
journal publishing theoretical, practical, tutorial and survey papers
on all aspects of supercomputing. The papers published generally fall
into areas such as technology, architecture and systems, algorithms,
languages and programs, performance measures and methods, and
applications. The tutorial and survey papers are intended for workers
and students in the fields associated with and employing advanced
computer systems. Letters to the Editor are also published, especially
in areas relating to policy, succinct statements of paradoxes,
intuitively puzzling results, partial results and real needs.
The theoretical and practical papers in specific areas are advanced,
in-depth treatments describing new developments and new ideas. Each
such paper contains an introduction summarizing prior, directly
pertinent work that is useful for the reader to understand, in order
to appreciate the advances being described.

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

Three copies of the manuscript should be sent to Mary Ann
Grandjean, Managing Editor, The Journal of Supercomputing, 17100
Science Drive, Bowie, MD 20715-4300.  Papers are refereed before
they are accepted for publication, and it is assumed that all
submissions represent original work which has neither been
previously published nor is being considered elsewhere in the
same form.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Papers should be written in English* and include a concise,
informative abstract of 250 words or less and five to ten key
words.  The corresponding author's mailing address and all the
authors' affiliations should be indicated on the title page.  The
abstract, text, footnotes, references, tables, and figure
captions should be typed double-spaced, with one-inch margins, on
only one side of a page.
  Footnotes, which should be numbered consecutively and typed on
a separate sheet, should be used sparingly and be brief. 
Footnotes in tables are designated with lowercase superscript
letters.
  Each table and illustration should appear on a separate sheet
at the end of the manuscript; figure captions should be numbered
consecutively and typed on a separate sheet.  The first mention
of a figure or table in the text should be indicated in the left
margin.
  Each author should submit a black and white publicity or
passport photograph along with a brief biographical sketch not to
exceed 70 words in length.

ILLUSTRATIONS

Photocopies of figures and tables are acceptable for papers
submitted for review.  However, the final version of an accepted
paper must include camera-ready figures and diagrams which are
sufficiently high in quality to meet the requirements for direct
reproduction.
  The maximum submission size for figures is 8 1/2 inches by 11
inches.  Line drawings should be drawn large size in black ink on
white paper.  All lettering used in illustrations should be done
in ink, not typescript, and be sufficiently large to take
reduction.  Each figure must be clearly labeled on the back,
preferably with a soft pencil, with the author's name and the
figure number.  If necessary, the author should indicate which
side of the figure is the top.
  Vertical rules in tables should generally be avoided.
  If possible, computer-generated output reports should be
original copies that have been produced by non-dot matrix
printers.  Output must be printed on plain white paper.

MATHEMATICAL NOTATION

Mathematical symbols, subscripts, superscripts, Greek letters,
and unusual notations require special care.  Mathematical copy
should be typed or marked exactly as it should appear in print. 
Journal style for letter symbols is as follows: variables, italic
type (indicated by underline); constants, roman text type;
matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word processor manuscripts, appropriate typeface
should be used.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed
equations are to be set in italic type unless marked otherwise. 
All letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they are
to be italic or boldface.  Best breaks for equations must be
indicated in case they do not fit on one line.
  Authors should also clearly distinguish between elements that
can be easily confused: for example, the letters "o" and "O" and
zero; the letter "l", the number "1," and a prime sign; the
letter "u" and mu; and the letter "v" and nu.
  In the text all equations should be written clearly to avoid
the use of "built-up" fractions; for example, (n + 1)? is
preferable to ? .  This does not apply to displayed equations.

REFERENCES

The reference list should contain only those works which have
been mentioned in the text.  Entries should be listed
alphabetically by the author's last name followed by the year of
publication.  If an author has written several works, some as
sole author and others as senior author, the entries should be
ordered as follows:

      Smith, E.E. 1979
      Smith, W.E. 1982
      Smith, W.E., and Bacon, E.G. 1981
      Smith, W.E. and West, F. 1980
      Smith, W.E., West, F., and Bacon, E.G. 1974

Lowercase letters (a,b,c,etc.) after the publication date are
used to distinguish among several papers published by the same
author or group of authors in the same year.
  References should be complete (see samples below).  All entries
should include the names of all authors, the year of publication,
and the full title of the work.  For a book, the edition,
publisher, and place of publication must also be provided; for a
journal article, the name of the journal, the volume, and the
inclusive page numbers of the article.

Seminumerical Algorithms, 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass.

A citation in the text should give the last name of the author
and the publication date, enclosed in brackets, at the end of the
sentence in which the citation is first made, for example, [Smith
1979].  When a work by three or more authors is cited, only the
first author's name followed by "et al." need be given.  Multiple
citations within brackets are listed alphabetically and separated
by semicolons.

COPYRIGHT

Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be required to sign a
copyright form transferring the copyright from the authors or
their employers to the publisher.

PROOFS AND OFFPRINTS

Authors will receive galley proofs which must be checked and
returned to the publisher within 48 hours of receipt.  Only
typographical errors should be corrected in proofs; authors will
be billed for extra costs incurred by changes other than
typesetter's errors.
  Fifty free offprints will be sent to the corresponding author. 
Additional offprints may be purchased by completing the
appropriate form sent with the proofs.


* Manuscript submission in languages other than English may be
acceptable if a translator with technical expertise in the topic
of the papers is available.  Please contact the managing editor.
