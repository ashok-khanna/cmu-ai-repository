Artificial Intelligence Review offers state-of-the art survey and tutorial
papers and provides a forum for review and commentary on Artificial
Intelligence foundations, applications and current research.
Artificial Intelligence Review includes refereed commentary offering
multiple perspectives on significant developments in Artificial
Intelligence, Cognitive Science and related disciplines. It aims to
illustrate the variety of styles and points of view which characterises
research in this important field of scientific discovery.
Artificial Intelligence Review is intended to serve both the "newcomer"
and the "established" researcher alike. It sets out to explain AI to those
who may be researchers in other fields or simply interested in
incorporating AI ideas into their work. It serves the needs of established
AI research workers as a convenient route into an unfamiliar sub-field,
provides a general reference source for newcomers, and offers an informed
opinion on new methods, approaches and publications in the field.

Tutorial Papers should:
- not exceed 5000 words,
- assume an audience which is inexpert in the field,
- avoid the use of jargon wherever possible,
- begin with a brief overview of the content of the paper (maximum length
  150 words) which should not repeat the introduction or conclusions. This
  should be followed by keywords for the purposes of indexing,
- be written in a style which is disciplined and precise, and avoid the
  use of convoluted constructions,
- emphasize basic concepts,
- provide illustrative examples where possible,
- give full standard citations.

Survey Papers should:
- cover tools, techniques or products,
- not exceed 5000 words,
- assume an audience with a basic knowledge of the area,
- give full references for further reading or information.

Book Reviews should:
- cover books in any area related to AI,
- not exceed 1000 words per item (unless the book is clearly a landmark
  publication)
- given an overview of the subject of the book and describe the intended
  audience,
- avoid chapter by chapter accounts,
- evaluate the author's ability to express or explain a concept,
- describe the author's style,
- give the author's background if it has a bearing on the book,
- define the author's standpoint,
- evaluate specific, outstanding, sections, giving particular examples,
  but avoiding the use of long quotations from the book.

A feature of AI Review is `Response Time', a section devoted to replies
from publishers, authors and organizations whose publications and products
have been reviewed. Prospective reviewers are asked to note that the
Editor will send copies of any review received to the relevant bodies for
their comment, once the review has been accepted for publication.

Viewpoints:
- May express original views or be responses to material published in
  earlier issues,
- should not exceed 2000 words,
- should be written in a style which is succinct,
- should have an overall impact through the style of presentation as well
  as the view being expressed.

Five copies of the manuscript should be sent to: The Journals Editorial
Office, Artificial Intelligence Review, Kluwer Academic Publishers, P.O.
Box 17, 3300 AA Dordrecht, The Netherlands, or, Artificial Intelligence
Review, P.O. Box 230, Accord, MA 02018-0230, U.S.A. Manuscripts should be
typewritten on 8 1/2" x 11" bond paper, one side only, leaving 1" margins

five spaces.
