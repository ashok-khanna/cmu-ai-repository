AIMS AND SCOPE

Designs, Codes and Cryptography is a technical journal
publishing survey and original papers in the designated areas. There
is a great deal of activity in design theory, coding theory and
cryptography and recently there has been considerable research done
which brings together more than one of the subjects. Journals
currently exist for each of the individual areas but none encourage
the interaction of the disciplines.

The aim of this journal is to provide a forum for high quality papers
of both a theoretical and a practical nature which bridge more than
one of these areas. The scope of the new journal is wide. Papers
emphasizing the algebraic and geometric aspects of any of the areas
considered, with papers touching more than one of the areas being
especially welcome.

The journal is published four times per year with distribution to
engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and other in education,
industry and government.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original works
which has neither appeared, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit five hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Karen S. Cullen
DESIGNS, CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY - Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528
Norwell,  MA 02061                    

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred mailing address
(including street and bldg. nos) of the contact author for
correspondence and return of proofs.  Please be sure to include a
telephone number, fax number and e-mail address.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  All papers should be written in English.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper in alphabetical order and numbered consecutively
with items referred to in the text by arabic numerals in brackets
(e.g., [1]). References should be complete, in the following
style:

Style for papers: Author(s), title, volume, year of publication
and inclusive page numbers.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher and location,
volume, year of publication, chapter or page numbers (if
desired).

Examples as follows:

[1] K.T. Arasu and Alexander Pott, On quasiregular collineation
groups of projective planes, Designs, Codes and Cryptography,
Vol. 1, No. 1 (1991) pp. 83-92.

[2] P. Dembowski, Finite Geometries, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-
Heidelberg, New York (1968).

[3] K. Koyama and K. Ohta, Identity-based conference key
distribution systems, Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of
Crypto 87 (C. Pomerence, ed.) Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
Springer-Verlag, New York, 293 (1988) pp. 175-194.

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

6.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
zero crossing of the second derivative of the (a) Gaussian and
(b) sine filter for the same input function."

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Original for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Include a separate sheet listing the captions for all
figures.
