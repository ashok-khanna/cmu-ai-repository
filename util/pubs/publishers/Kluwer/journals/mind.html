AIMS AND SCOPE

Mind and Machines affords an international forum for discussion and debate
of important and controversial issues concerning significant developments
within its areas of editorial focus. Well-reasoned contributions from
diverse theoretical perspectives are welcome and every effort will be made
to ensure their prompt publication. Among the features that are intended
to make this journal distinctive within the field are these:
- Strong stands on controversial issues are especially encouraged;
- Important articles exceeding normal journal length may appear;
- Special issues devoted to specific topics will be a regular feature;
- Review essays discussing current problem situations will appear;
- Critical responses to previously published pieces are also invited.
This journal is intended to foster a tradition of criticism within the AI
and philosophical communities on problems and issues of common concern.
Its scope explicitly encompasses philosophical aspects of computer
sciences. All submissions will be subject to review.

symbols must be clearly identified. Underline only words or letters to
appear in italics.

Title, name, adress
