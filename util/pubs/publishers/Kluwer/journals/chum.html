SCOPE
Established in 1966, Computers and the Humanities (CHum) reports on
computer applications in the humanities, including:

- literature of all periods and genres
- languages and linguistics
- musicology
- history
- art history
- humanistically oriented social science

Articles include reports on the latest research in these areas, as well as
pedagogical applications. The occasional special issue covers particularly
vital topics such as: natural language processing, computer-assisted
instruction, artificial intelligence, and surveys of computing activities
in countries such as Canada, France and Italy.

Those who wish to advance beyond word processing to genuine computer-aided
research and instruction in the humanities will find Computers and the
Humanities an indispensable tool.
