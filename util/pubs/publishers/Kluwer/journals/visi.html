AIMS AND SCOPE

The International Journal of Computer Vision provides a
forum for the dissemination of new research results in the rapidly
growing field of computer vision, publishing high quality, original
papers on the computational aspects of vision, including vision
algorithms, systems, artificial intelligence approaches and computer
architectures for vision, as well as on the applications of computer
vision with special emphasis on robotics and photo interpretation.
Academic and industrial researchers in the areas of computer vision,
robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as psychologists
studying the psychology of vision, will find the International
Journal of Computer Vision to be the essential forum for the
presentation of important results in the field.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original works
which have not appeared, nor are under consideration, in other
journals.  Papers which have previously appeared in conference
proceedings will also be considered, and this should be so
indicated at the time of submission.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit five hard copies of their final
manuscript to either one of the editors at the following
addresses:

TAKEO KANADE
Computer Science Department
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh,   PA 15213
[ArpaNet address: Kanade@IUS3.CMU.EDU]

ROBERT BOLLES
SRI Artificial Intelligence Center
333 Ravenswood Avenue 
Menlo Park,   CA 94025
email: bolles@iu.ai.sri.com

OLIVIER FAUGERAS
INRIA
Unit de Recherche de Sophia-Antipolis
2004 Route des Lucioles
06565 Valbonne Cedex, FRANCE
email: faugeras@mirsa.inria.fr

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from five
to ten index terms (key phrases).

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations in the style
described below.  Alternatively, good quality copies may be sent
initially, with the originals ready to be sent immediately upon
acceptance of paper.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving your complete preferred
address (including street and/or building numbers) for
correspondence and return of proofs.  Please be sure to include
your ArpaNet address.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  Papers exceeding 50 pages in length (including figures) may
be returned to the author for shortening.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Provide an informative 100-to 250-word abstract at the head
of the manuscript.  The abstracts are printed with the articles.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered references.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper, with items referred to by author and date of
publication in parentheses, e.g., (Marr 1982).  References should
be complete, in the following style:

Style for papers: Author, last name followed by first initials,
year of publication, title, volume, inclusive page numbers.

Style for books: Author, year, title, publisher and location,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

(Book) Marr. D. 1982. Vision, a Computational Investigation into
the Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information. 
Freeman: San Francisco, CA.

(Journal Article) Huffman, D.A. 1976.  Curvature and creases: A
Primer on paper. IEEE Trans. Computers C-25(10): 1010-1019.

(Conference Proceedings) Witkin, A. 1983. Scales space filtering.
In Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell., Karlsruhe, West
Germany, pp. 1019-1021.

(Lab. memo.) Yuille, A.L. and Poggio, I. 1983. Scaling theorems
for zero crossings. M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab. Massachusetts
Inst. Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo. 722.

5.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
zero crossings of the second derivative of the (a) Gaussian and
(b) sine filter for the same input function."

6.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as it should appear in
print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.
