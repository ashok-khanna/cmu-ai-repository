Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)
An International Journal

Coordinating Editor

Kjeld Schmidt, Risoe National Laboratory

Scope
This new International Journal will be devoted to innovative research in
Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). It will provide an
interdisciplinary forum for the debate and exchange of ideas concerning
theoretical, practical, technical and social issues in CSCW. The journal
arises as a timely response to the growing interest in the design,
implementation and use of technical systems which support people working
cooperatively. Equally, the journal is concerned with studies of the
process of cooperative work itself - studies intended to motivate the
design of new technical systems. The journal will encourage contributions
from a wide range of disciplines and perspectives within the social,
computing and allied human and information sciences. In general, the
journal will facilitate the discussion of all issues which arise in
connection with the support requirements of cooperative work.
It is intended that the journal will be of interest to a wide readership
through its coverage of research related to - inter alia - groupware,
socio-technical system design, theoretical models of cooperative work,
computer mediated communication, human-computer interaction, group
decision support systems (GDSS), coordination systems, distributed
systems, studies of cooperative work and practical action, organisation
theory and design, the sociology of technology, explorations of innovative
design strategies, management and business science perspectives,
artificial intelligence and distributed AI approaches to cooperation, and
all manner of technical innovations devoted to the support of cooperative
work including electronic meeting rooms, teleconferencing facilities,
electronic mail enhancements, real-time and asynchronous technologies,
desk-top conferencing, shared editors, video and multi-media systems. In
addition, studies of the social, cultural, moral, legal and political
implications of CSCW systems are also welcomed.

Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): An International Journal is
edited by an international Editorial Collective of established researchers
in the field and also includes a multi-disciplinary Advisory Board who are
committed to the development of the journal and the enhancement of the
field of CSCW research itself.
