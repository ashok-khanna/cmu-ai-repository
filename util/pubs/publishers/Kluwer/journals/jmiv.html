AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision is a
technical journal publishing important new developments in
mathematical imaging. The journal publishes research articles, invited
papers, and expository articles.
Current developments in new image processing hardware, the advent of
multisensor data fusion, and rapid advances in vision research have
led to an explosive growth in the interdisciplinary field of imaging
science. This growth has resulted in the development of highly
sophisticated mathematical models and theories. The aim of the journal
is to emphasize the role of mathematics as a rigorous basis for
imaging science. This provides a sound alternative to present journals
in this area. Contributions are judged on the basis of mathematical
content. Articles may be physically speculative but need to be
mathematically sound. Emphasis is placed on innovative or established
mathematical techniques applied to vision and imaging problems in a
novel way, as well as new developments and problems in mathematics
arising from these applications.

The scope of the journal includes:
- computational models of vision; imaging algebra and mathematical
  morphology
- mathematical methods in reconstruction, compactification, and coding
- filter theory
- probabilistic, statistical, geometric, topological, and fractal
  techniques and models in imaging science
- inverse optics
- wave theory

Specific application areas of interest include, but are not
limited to:
- all aspects of image formation and representation
- medical, biological, industrial, geophysical, astronomical and
military imaging
- image analysis and image understanding
- parallel and distributed computing
- computer vision architecture design

The journal emphasizes its commitment to present coverage in these
areas which span the interest of a global audience. The Editorial
Board publishes manuscripts that are well-written and make a
significant technical contribution.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Papers should be well organized, clearly written, and meet the
aims and scope of the journal.  Correct English grammar and style
is a basic requirement for publication.  Poorly written papers
place an unnecessary burden on the referees and the editors
reserve the right to reject such papers without technical review.

Mathematical research results should be verified by providing
proofs or citation of appropriate references.  Conjectures and
claims based on empirical evidence should include discussions of
experimental results and methodology.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.  Some typical key word examples are: image
algebra, image formation and restoration, linear and nonlinear
image, and industrial imaging.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.  Upon acceptance of the paper, authors
must supply a brief biographical sketch.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  Authors should try to keep the length of the paper (including
figures) under 36 double spaced pages.

7.  All papers should be written in English.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplications are
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should be numbered and listed in the order of
citation in a separate section at the end of the paper, with
citations by numbers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2], etc.).

Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

zero crossings."  M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab., Massachusetts Inst.
Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo. 722, 1983.

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

ORGANIZATION OF PAPER

1.  TITLE.  Brief and to the point to inform the readers of the
subject.

2.  ABSTRACT.  A concise, informative, and lucid digest of the
paper, preferably 100-250 words.  This will eliminate the need
for a summary.

3.  INTRODUCTION.  The introduction should orient the reader to
the purpose and scope of the paper.  It should provide the
motivation for the paper and clearly indicate the relationship
between the research described and previous relative work.

4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.  This section should be a clear and
concise account of the research accomplishments.  The main
theorems and results should be contained in this section. 
However, in order to ease communication of research results and
make the paper readable to a wise audience, long intricate proofs
and proofs of minor lemmas and theorems needed to establish the
main results should be presented in an Appendix.

5.  APPENDICES.  This section should contain material that may
have prevented easy communication of research accomplishments. 
Examples of lengthy or intricate proofs of theorems, statements
of lemmas and minor theorems, complicated or lengthy algorithms,
and complex details of experiments.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

9.  Color illustrations will be accepted for publication. 
However, the cost of publishing color illustrations will be
charged to the author.  Authors should inquire about cost from
the publisher before submitting a color illustration.

PROOFING
