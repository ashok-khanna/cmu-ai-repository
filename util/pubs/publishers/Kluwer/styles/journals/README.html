The following is a list of Kluwer style files that can be used to
format a small (16 x 24 cm) or large (19.5  x 26 cm) journal article
("get" the files the same way you did README):

lgjrnl.sty	lgjrnl.doc	lgjsamp.tex	lgjtmpl.tex
smjrnl.sty	smjrnl.doc	smjsamp.tex	smjtmpl.tex	

******************************************************************************
                    IMPORTANT INFORMATION
        ***Please read this information before using files.****

**For a small format (16 x 24 cm), SINGLE COLUMN journal use the files
beginning with the prefix "smj".
**For a large format (19.5  x 26 cm), DOUBLE COLUMN journal use the files
beginning with the prefix "lgj".

The .sty files contain two reference styles, i.e., numbered and
alphabetical.  Please choose the correct reference style for your
journal.  All incorrect reference styles will be returned to the author to
fix.

If you are an author for MACHINE LEARNING or REAL TIME SYSTEMS you can 
submit your ACCEPTED article electronically to the e-mail address below. 
All other authors are welcome to use the style files and can submit their
article, along with a disk cotaining the LaTeX file, the traditional way.

For articles submitted electronically - make sure your article contains no
errors or problems such as text running into the margins or text running
together.

Any questions on which files to use please contact the e-mail address below.

Note, if you have a problem with the style file please 1) make sure you are
using the current version (August 10, 1993 or later) before inquiring about
a problem and 2) if you still have the problem send a short .tex file as
an example.
****************************************************************************
 
The files can be used as follows:

1. Main style file: 	smjrnl.sty. or lgjrnl.sty

2. Documentation:	smjrnl.doc. or lgjrnl.doc

3. The template file, smjtmpl.tex or lgjtmpl.tex, makes it easier to enter the
	correct commands in the correct order.

4. The sample file, smjsamp.tex or lgjsamp.tex, may help to see how to use the
	commands. (All parts of the sample file are shown in the documentation.)

5. smjstyles.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing all files needed
   to produce a small format journal article.

6. lgjstyles.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing all files needed
   to produce a large format journal article.
