\section{An Example of Some Programming Code}
When you want to demonstrate some programming code, these are
the commands to use. Lines will be preserved as you see them
on the screen, as will spaces at the beginning of the line.


% Notice that to produce printed `{' brackets, precede them with \string

% Notice that \begin{codebox}...\end{codebox} can be inserted within
%   codesamp, and will be positioned at the same distance from right
%   margin as text. codebox needs an argument for the width of the box,
%   as in  \begin{codebox}{2.5in} below.

\begin{codesamp}
sqrdc(a, n)(a, qraux)\string{
  \underline{DARRAY float[180] a[180];}
  float qraux[180], col[180], nrmxl,t;
  int n,i,j,k,l;
  DO(1=0, n)\string{
         \underline{ALIGN*(i=1, n) col[i]=a[l][i];}
         \begin{codebox}{2.5in}
         init*\string{ nrmxl=0.0;\string}
         DO*(i=l, n)\string{
           nrmxl += col[i]*col[i];\string}
         combine*\string{nrmxl;\string}
         \end{codebox}
         nmxl=sqrt(nrmxl);
         if (nrmxl != 0.00)\string{
            if (col[1]=1.0+col[1];
\newpage
%% You may need to insert a \newpage to start a new page to keep the
%% code and box on the same page.


            \begin{codebox}{1.5in}
            DO*(j=(l+1), p)\string{
              float t; int i;
              t=0.0
              DO(i=1, n)\string{
                  t=t+col[i]
            \string}
            \end{codebox}
            qraux[1]=col[1]
            col[1]= -nrmxl;
            \underline{ALIGN*(i=1, n)a[1][i]=col[i];}
        \string}
   \string}
\string}
\end{codesamp}

\subsubsection{To Illustrate an Algorithm}

This is the command to use when you want to illustrate an algorithm
with some pseudo code. A backslash followed with a space will
indent the line. Every line will be printed
as it is seen on the screen. Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

%% \bit will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
%% boldface in Computer Modern.

\begin{algorithm}
{\bit Evaluate-Single-FOE} ({\bf x$_f$, I$_0$, I$_1$}):
\ {\bf I}+ := {\bf I}$_1$;
\ ($\phi,\theta$) := (0,0);
\ {\it repeat}\note{/*usually only 1 interation required*/}
\ \ (s$_{opt}${\bf E}$_\eta$) := {\bit Optimal-Shift} ({\bf I$_0$,I$^+$,I$_0$,x$_f$});
\ \ ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$) := {\bit Equivalent-Rotation} ({\bf s}$_{opt}$);
\ \ ($\phi$, $\theta$) := ($\phi$, $\theta$) + ($\phi^+$, $\theta^+$);
\ \ {\bf I}$^+$:= {\bit Derotate-Image} ({\bf I}$_1$, $\phi$, $\theta$);
\ \ {\it until} ($\|\phi^+\|\leq\phi_{max}$ \& $\|\theta^+\|\leq\theta_{max}$);
\ {\it return} ({\bf I}$^+$, $\phi$, $\theta$, E$_\eta$).

End pseudo-code.
\end{algorithm}


\section{Indexing Samples}

%% \inx{(term)} will print the term in the text AND send it to the
%% .inx file. \inxx{(term)} will only send term to .inx file. In
%% either case the page number of the page where the term was found
%% will be sent as well.

This is \inx{normal} text. 
This is normal text. \inxx{normaltext}
This is normal text.
This is normal text.
For more samples, please see the section on indexing in the documentation.


%% After the \appendix command, \chapter, \section, equation numbering
%% and caption numbering will all be adjusted to work correctly as appendix.
