JOURNAL OF DESIGN SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY

Published by
Editions HERMES
14, rue Lantiez
75017 Paris - France

Aims and scope
----------------------
The design of new products drives to solve problems which solutions are still 
partial and which tools and methods of assistance are rudimentary. Design is 
applied in extremely various fields and implies numerous agents during all the 
process of elaboration and realisation. 
The International Journal of Design Sciences and Technology (DST) is a 
multidisciplinary forum dealing with all facets and fields of design. It 
endeavours to provide a framework with which to support debates on the 
different economical, historical, pedagogical, philosophical, scientific and 
technological issues surrounding design. Its focus is general as well as 
specific, at the level of both ideas and experiential savoir-faire. Besides 
examining the concepts and the questions raised by academic and theoretical 
communities in the hard and social sciences, DST also addresses the 
concerns and approaches of different industrial and professional design 
disciplines. DST seeks to follow the growth of the universe of design, to 
observe, to interpret and to contribute to design's dynamic, expanding 
sciences and technology.
 
Call for Papers
---------------------
The journal publishes articles in research (fundamental, finalised or applied), 
notes of reflection and synthesis stating on the design, case studies and 
reports of experimentation.
Papers must be related to one of the following three axes : 
know-how, sectorial approach, methodological researches.
Instructions to authors

words. The First page should contain the author's name and affiliation, the title 
of the article, an abstract (200 words) and 8 to 10 key words. Each page
