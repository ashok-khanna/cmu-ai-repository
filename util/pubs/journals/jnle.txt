                JOURNAL OF NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING


"Natural Language Engineering" is a new journal, to be  launched  by  CambridgeUniversity  Press  in 1995.  It is an international forum for the disseminationof results concerning the theory  and  practice  of  applied  natural  languageprocessing.   The  focus is on publications addressing research and developmentissues fundamental to engineering of natural language technologies. A principalconcern   will   be   systems   which  can  operate  in  realistic  applicationenvironments, in terms of their scale, robustness, feasibility, maintenability,usability and system integration.

The  editors  are  particularly  anxious  to respond to identified needs in theresearch  community.   The  field  currently  lacks  an  outlet  dedicated   tocommunicating  technology-oriented  work.   There  is  also  a  lack  of easilyaccessible  reference  materials  discussing  the   impact   of   research   incomputational  linguistics,  computer  science,  artificial  intelligence,  andcognitive psychology on the task of engineering for practical natural  languageprocessing applications.

Original  articles  are  sought,  addressing  issues in all areas of linguisticengineering; these include, but are not limited, to: adaptive  systems;  corpusprocessing;  delivery  of assistance (e.g. help systems, explanation); dialoguemanagement; front ends to  computational  systems,  both  single  modality  andmultimodal;  grammar  and  style  checking;  information management and access;language teaching aids;  lexicon  acquisition  and  implementation;  linguisticknowledge   bases   (e.g.    lexica,  grammars,  term  banks);  localising  formultilingual systems; machine translation; multimedia  authoring  and  deliveryenvironments;  performance evaluation; speech and natural language integration;text analysis and  content  extraction;  text  generation;  tools  for  naturallanguage  processing.   Articles  may  discuss  separate technologies, completeapplications, system evaluations, and limitations of particular designs.

The review process is specifically designed for speedy publication.
