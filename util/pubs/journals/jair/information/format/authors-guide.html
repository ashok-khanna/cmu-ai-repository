Once a paper has been accepted for publication in JAIR, you should follow
the procedure outlined below. The final version of your manuscript
is due to us *within three months* of the acceptance date. If you require
more than three months, please request an extension from the editor. 


1. Format your article according the JAIR style, which is described in
   instructions.ps and the other files in the directory information/format.
   There are subdirectories for LaTex, FrameMaker and Gnu's GROFF. 
   (We request that you use LaTex if possible.)  Authors are responsible 
   for correctly formatting their article. If you wish we can recommend 
   professionals who will do this for you for a fee.

2. Please print out, fill in, and sign the Postscript Transfer of Copyright
   form in this directory. (If you have trouble printing the PostScript,
   we can send you an ascii version.) Send the form to:
     Steven Minton
     NASA Ames Research Center, Mail stop 269-2
     Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000

   Once you transfer the copyright, AI Access Foundation grants the
   rights to publish the hardcopy version to Morgan Kaufmann. If you
   have any questions, we'd be glad to answer them.

3. Make any final changes and proofread your article. Unfortunately, we 
   do not have the staff to proofread it ourselves.

4. Send us the Postscript file. We will check it over quickly, and if
   it is acceptable, we will let you know the publication date and the
   page numbers for your article. 

5. Once you have the publication date and page numbers, email us the 
   "final PostScript File", the source file (if possible), an ascii
   abstract, and any online appendixes. If there are online appendices
   containing source code, we will ask you to sign a release form 
   so that AI Access Foundation and our distributors will not be liable.

6. After we receive the final version, we will post an announcement 
   on the JAIR newgroup comp.ai.jair.announcments. The paper and appendices
   will appear on comp.ai.jair.papers. The paper will also be stored at the
   JAIR distribution site. Periodically, we also send out announcements to
   our mailing list for people that don't read netnews.

7. If you know of any other mailing lists where it would be appropriate to 
   post an announcement for your paper (e.g. ML-LIST for machine learning 
   papers), please let the executive editor know so that we can do so.

Congratulations!
