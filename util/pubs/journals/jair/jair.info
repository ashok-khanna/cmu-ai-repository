                        CALL FOR PAPERS


JAIR is a refereed publication, covering all areas of AI, that will be
distributed over the internet.  In addition, each complete volume of
JAIR will be published by Morgan Kaufmann.  JAIR will offer AI
researchers several advantages over existing journals:

 --  To promote rapid publication of research results, articles sent to 
     JAIR will be reviewed and returned to the authors in approximately
     6 weeks. Electronic publication will occur immediately after the 
     editor receives the final version of an accepted article.

 --  Articles will be distributed free of charge over the internet via ftp, 
     automated email, and a newsgroup. Articles will be available 
     in postscript. (We are considering additional formats as well.)

 --  Subscribers will be able to take full advantage of the electronic medium.
     JAIR will support a variety of electronic services, such as
     online appendices containing data/code.

JAIR will only publish articles of the highest quality.  Submissions
will be evaluated on their originality and significance.  All claims
should be clearly articulated and justified either empirically or
theoretically.  Papers should describe work that has both practical
and theoretical significance.

We encourage authors to be concise. Short, high-quality articles will
be welcomed, in addition to the longer articles that traditionally
appear in AI journals. JAIR will also publish technical notes -- very
brief papers that extend or evaluate previous work.  We invite
submissions in all areas of AI, including automated reasoning,
cognitive modeling, knowledge representation, learning, natural
language, perception, and robotics.
