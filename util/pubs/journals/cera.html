Subject:  CONCURRENT  ENGINEERING: RESEARCH & APPLICATIONS  (CERA)  --
International Journal --  An Announcement


Dear Fellow Researcher:


We are pleased to inform you that Concurrent Engineering (CE)  Institute
of International Society of Productivity Enhancement (ISPE) in collab-
oration  with Academic Press, London has started a new  journal  enti-
tled:  Concurrent  Engineering: Research & Applications (CERA)  --  An
International  Journal." CERA is a refereed archival quality  publica-
tion.  This journal fills a void for a very important and timely  sub-
ject  matter.  "Concurrent Engineering" has been recognized  for  some
time  to be a major force behind achieving international  competitive-
ness,   responsiveness  and improving productivity. If you  have
worked  in  this area, we would like to seek your inputs  in  making
this endeavor a success.


We take this opportunity to invite you to submit your original  contri-
bution  to CERA for possible publication. Please inform  your  friends
and colleagues or write to me, who can contribute. A "Call for  Paper"
is enclosed.

If  you are interested in subscribing CERA Journal in 1993,  or  would
like  to  get a free sample copy for review please  write/call/fax
your request to Academic Press, London. They would send you  the
required  information.  If you have further question,  please  do  not
hesitate to write to us or EMAIL at CERA editorial office in USA.

Thanking you and looking forward to hearing from you soon,


Sincerely,


Biren Prasad, Ph.D.
Managing Editor
Chairman, CERA J. Task Force.

                    ANNOUNCEMENT & CALL FOR PAPERS


           CONCURRENT ENGINEERING: RESEARCH & APPLICATIONS

                  (CERA) - An International Journal


CERA  is a new international, multidisciplinary journal to  promote  a
better  understanding of Concurrency in enterprise modeling,  informa-
tion  processing  and  computing. The purpose of this  journal  is  to
provide  an  international forum for the dissemination  of  scientific
work on Concurrent Engineering based on computer technologies. Concur-
rent  Engineering (CE) is an official journal of the Concurrent  Engi-
neering  Institute of the International Society for  Productivity  En-
hancement (ISPE). CERA is the key publication for the newest and  most
exciting  research  arising from parallelism of product's  life  cycle
functions.  CERA deals with all basic tracks that enable CE  including
aspects  of  Information Modeling,  Teaming &  Sharing,  Networking  &
Distribution, Planning & Scheduling,  Reasoning & Negotiation, Collab-
orative  Decision Making, Organization and Management of CE.  Emphasis
is  placed on CE technologies that result in faster  product  develop-
ment,  higher quality, lower costs, improved productivity  and  better
customer value. The journal is an important source of information  for
design, engineering and manufacturing personnel and those with  inter-
est  in research, development and applications of productivity  tools,
methods and concepts.

The  distinguishing  nature of the journal will be to foster  the  ex-
change   and integration of concepts and theories from  these  diverse
areas,  and cross-fertilization of enabling CE technologies to  stimu-
late  thinking  that can generate new insights. A second  goal  is  to
publish  interdisciplinary research that advances  interactions  among
these  are well known researchers and practitioners in the field  from
industy,  university  and government laboratories.  The  distinguished
Editorial Board reflects the excellence of this important journal  and
the  commitment  to publish quality articles on the  most  timely  and
significant  trends, issues, problems and applications  of  Concurrent
Engineering in modern manufacturing.
