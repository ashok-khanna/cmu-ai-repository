We are soliciting contributed papers reporting research on the 
synthesis of biological phenomena in hardware, software, and wetware.  

Artificial Life, a new quarterly from The MIT Press, is the first 
unifying forum for the dissemination of scientific and engineering 
research in the field of Artificial Life. It reports on synthetic 
biological work being carried out in any media, from the familiar 
"wetware" of organic chemistry, through the inorganic "hardware" of 
mobile robots, all the way to the virtual "software" residing inside 
computers. Topics range from the origin of life, through self-
reproduction, evolution, growth and development, animal behavior....
and so forth, on to the dynamics of whole ecosystems. 


Artificial Life  will be an essential resource for scientists, academics, 
and students researching artificial life, biology, evolution, robotics, 
artificial intelligence, neural networks, genetic algorithms, ecosystems
and the origin of life.

The initial 3 issues of Volume 1 consist of a special set of overview
articles, written by members of the Editorial Board, giving detailed
reviews of distinct sub-disciplines within Artificial Life. Taken 
together, these articles constitute the most thorough and in-depth 
presentation of the theory and practice of Artificial Life provided to 
date; describing promising research directions, reviews of important 
open problems, and suggestions for new methodological approaches.
