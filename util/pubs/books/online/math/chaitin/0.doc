Summary:      The Limits of Mathematics

Version:      Draft of 7-JUL-94

Description: 

   This book features a definitive reformulation of algorithmic
   information theory with new more constructive definitions of
   program-size complexity. It is a revised version of the course notes
   given to the participant at the limits of mathematics short course,
   University of Maine, Orono, Maine, June 1994.

   The book discusses a new definition for a self-delimiting universal
   Turing machine (UTM) that is easy to program and runs very quickly. It
   then uses this to provide a new foundation for algorithmic information
   theory (AIT), which is the theory of the size in bits of programs for
   self-delimiting UTM's.  This new self-delimiting UTM is implemented
   via an extremely fast LISP interpreter written in C. Source code for
   the LISP interpreter is included in the book.

   This directory includes a copy of a 4 page summary of the book and the
   270-page book itself, in LaTeX, dvi, and PostScript formats.

   Three different versions of the book (and source) are included, in the 
   three directories lm_1, lm_2, and lm_3. The difference between the
   three is as follows:

      An N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to exhibit any
      specific object with program-size complexity greater than N+c.

      An N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to determine more
      than N+c' scattered bits of the halting probability Omega.

      LM I:
	    c = 2359 bits and c' = 7581 bits.
      LM II:
	    c = 1127 bits and c' = 3689 bits.
      LM III:
	    c =  994 bits and c' = 3192 bits.
      LM IV: 
            c =  735 bits and c' = 2933 bits.
