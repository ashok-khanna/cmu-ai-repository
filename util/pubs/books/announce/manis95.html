This text provides a rich, broad view of computer science, including not
just programming, but also a grand tour of many areas, including
programming languages and systems, databases, AI, logic programming, and
computer hardware. The book balances theory and practice, motivating
theoretical concepts by their practical applications. A number of
``working models'' of real systems are presented and studied, including
language evaluators, a relational database system, an inference engine,
and a graphics package. A major emphasis is the development of a unified
model of computation that explains how and why programs in Scheme (and
other languages) behave as they do.

The book has hundreds of exercises, all with answers, throughout the
text. At the end of each chapter, there are problem sets and a
self-assessment, with answers provided separately. 

A large number of sidebars present topics that are related to the main
text, including relevant applications, software tools, theoretical
topics, and social issues. 

`The Schematics of Computation' is based upon materials that have been
used at the University of British Columbia and several other places for
the past five years. It has been used for a two-semester introductory
sequence for students with no computing background, as well as a
one-semester course for students with prior programming experience.
