INTRODUCTION

The notion of an intelligent autonomous agent is one of the most  important
and  exciting  concepts  to  emerge in computer science in the 1990s. Agent
technology looks set to radically alter  not  only  the  way  in  which  we
interact  with  computers, but also the way we conceptualise and build com-
plex systems. This exciting and up-to-date volume is one of the first texts
to  deal  with a fundamental aspect of this emerging technology: the design
and construction of agents. The book is divided into four parts. The  first
contains  a  detailed introductory article, which presents the key research
issues in the theory and practice of intelligent agents; the  article  con-
tains  a  glossary of key terms to help the reader new to the field, a sum-
mary of implemented systems, and an extensive annotated  bibliography.  The
second  part  contains  a  number  of articles on the theory of intelligent
agents; the third part contains articles on agent  architectures  (software
engineering  models  of  agents),  and  the final part contains articles on
agent programming languages - the book is the first  to  deal  specifically
with this novel area.  An index is provided for easy reference.
 
The range of issues covered by the articles, together with  the  comprehen-
sive review, glossary, summary of key systems, bibliography, and index make
the book an essential source text for practitioners,  theorists,  and  stu-
dents that are either working or hoping to work in this exciting new field.
