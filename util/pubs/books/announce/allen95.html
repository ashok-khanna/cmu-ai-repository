           Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Announces:
       NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING, SECOND EDITION
                       James Allen 

This long-awaited revision offers a comprehensive introduction to natural
language understanding with coverage of the most current developments and
research in the field today.  Building on the effective framework of the
first edition, the new edition gives the same balanced coverage of syntax,
semantics, and discourse, and offers a uniform framework based on
feature-based context-free grammars and chart parsers used for syntactic
and semantic processing.  Thorough treatment of issues in discourse and
context-dependent interpretation is also provided.

In addition, this title offers coverage of two entirely new subject areas.
 First, the text features a new chapter on statistically-based methods
using large corpora.  Second, it includes an appendix on speech
recognition and spoken language understanding.  Also, the information on
semantics that was covered in the first edition has been largely expanded
in this edition to include an emphasis on compositional interpretation.
