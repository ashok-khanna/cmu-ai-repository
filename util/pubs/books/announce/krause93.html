REPRESENTING UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE

An Artificial Intelligence Approach

Paul Krause and Dominic Clark

A survey of current approaches to the representation 
of uncertain knowledge, covering:

o	Bayesian probability

o	Certainty factors

o	The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence

o	Possibility theory and fuzzy sets

o	Non-monotonic logics

o	Endorsement and argumentation approaches

Price: 14.95 Pounds in the UK, $22.50 in the USA.

The representation of uncertainty is a central issue in Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and is being addressed in many different ways. 
Each approach has its proponents, and each has had its detractors. 
However, there is now an increasing move towards the belief that an 
eclectic approach is required to represent and reason under the many 
facets of uncertainty. We believe that the time is ripe for a wide 
ranging, yet accessible, survey of the main formalisms.

In this book, we offer a broad perspective on uncertainty and 
approaches to managing uncertainty. Rather than provide a daunting 
mass of technical detail, we have focused on the foundations and 
intuitions behind the various schools. The aim has been to present in 
one volume an overview of the major issues and decisions to be 
made in representing uncertain knowledge. We identify the central 
role of managing uncertainty to AI and Expert Systems, and provide 
a comprehensive introduction to the different aspects of uncertainty. 
We then describe the rationales, advantages and limitations of the 
major approaches that have been taken, using illustrative examples. 
The book ends with a review of the lessons learned and current 
research directions in the field.

The intended readership will include researchers and 
practitioners involved in the design and implementation of Decision 
Support Systems, Expert Systems, other Knowledge-Based Systems 
and in Cognitive Science. This book will also be a valuable text for 
students of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Psychology and 
Engineering with an interest in AI or Decision Support Systems. 
They will find here:

o	A comprehensive review, with an extensive bibliography, of a 
field that is central to AI.

o	A survey of the major knowledge engineering and 
computational implications for the different techniques in 
terms of their respective requirements, merits and limitations.

o	Detailed worked examples and descriptions of applications.
