BLURB:

In many areas of computer science (software engineering, correctness
of large pieces of software, commonsense reasoning, robotics, ...)
and beyond (quantum mechanics, methodology of sciences, ...), one 
must reason with partial information. Classical mathematical logic 
and its variants (modal logic, Hoare logic, ...) all reason with total 
information.

A logic specifically designed for reasoning with partial information
is presented in the book, and its applications to commonsense reasoning, and
reasoning about actions are studied.

The book presents the foundations of reasoning with partial 
information and a theory of commonsense reasoning based on monotonic
reasoning and partial structures. The theory was designed 
specifically for the needs of practicing computer scientists and
provides easily implementable algorithms.

Starting from first principles, using the philosophical logic of scientific 
discovery of Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos, and the denotational semantics of 
Dana Scott, the book develops a system of reasoning with partial information 
and applies it to a comprehensive study of the problem examples found 
in the literature of commonsense reasoning. Proof-theoretic and 
model-theoretic views are both considered in the applications as well
as the logical problems of theoretical physics, such as the issues related
to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

The book points out that customary expositions of commonsense reasoning
(default logic, circumscription, AEL, etc.) are based on a flawed 
_non-monotonic reasoning paradigm_  and that the resulting _solutions_
for major problems such as the frame problem, are either ad-hoc 
or inadequate. One brings to light that _non-monotonicity_ is due 
to the hiding of some information that should not be hidden, 

The essential research in commonsense reasoning has been developed in
isolation from the disciplines of theoretical computer science and classical
logic. We break this isolation, and establish deep links.

The book will be of interest to computer scientists, mathematicians,
physicists, logicians, and philosophers interested in the
foundations and applications of reasoning with partial information.
