ANNOUNCING A NEW PUBLICATION FROM MORGAN KAUFMANN PUBLISHERS

ESSENTIALS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
BY MATT GINSBERG (University of Oregon)

ISBN 1-55860-221-6;   pages; cloth; $49.95 U.S / International
prices will vary.

Essentials of Artificial Intelligence is a significant new
introductory text for undergraduate and graduate course use. Based
on the author's course at Stanford University, the book is an
integrated, cohesive introduction to the discipline. The author has
a fresh, entertaining writing style that combines clear
presentations with humor and AI anecdotes. At the same time, as an
active AI researcher, he presents the material authoritatively and
with insight that reflects a contemporary, first hand understanding
of the field.
     The book has been extensively reviewed and class-tested in a
wide variety of courses and schools, and the material has been
repeatedly refined based on these experiences.

About the Author
     Matt Ginsberg received his doctorate in mathematics from
Oxford in 1980 at the age of 24. He remained on the faculty in
Oxford until 1983, doing research in mathematical physics and 
computer science; during this period, he wrote a program that was
used successfully to trade stock and stock options on Wall Street.
     Ginsberg's continuing interest in artificial intelligence
brought him to Stanford in late 1983, where he remained for nine
years, teaching introductory AI and related courses. Ginsberg
currently directs CIRL, the computational intelligence research
laboratory at the University of Oregon. His present interests
include real-time planning and problem solving, multivalued and
modal logic, and nonmontonic reasoning. He is the author of
numerous publications in these areas and the editor of 
Morgan Kaufmann's Readings in Nonmonotonic Reasoning.
