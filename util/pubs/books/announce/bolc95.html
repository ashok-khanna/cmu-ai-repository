TIME AND LOGIC
A computational approach
Edited by
Leonard Bolc (Polish Academy of Science, Warsaw)
Andrzej Szalas (Institute of Informatics, University of Warsaw)

In this book, some of the major current developments in our understanding and 
application of temporal logic are presented in computational terms. Time and 
logic: a computational approach will be an essential sourcebook for those 
within the specific field of temporal logic, as well as providing invaluable 
introductory material for those seeking an entry into this increasingly
important area of theoretical computing.
  The emphasis in the book is on presenting a broad range of approaches to
computational applications. The techniques used will also be applicable in 
many cases to formalisms beyond temporal logic alone, and it is hoped that 
adaptation to many different logics of programs will be facilitated. Throughout,
the authors have kept implementation-orientated solutions in mind.

The book begins with an introduction to the basic ideas of temporal logic. 
Successive chapters then examine particular aspects of the temporal theoretical
computing domain, relating their applications to familiar areas of research, 
such as stochastic process theory, automata theory, established proof systems, 
model checking, relational logic and classical predicate logic. This is an 
essential addition to the library of all theoretical computer scientists, 
providing a synthesis of well established results in temporal logic with the 
most up-to-date findings of some of the world's leading theoreticians. It is 
an authoritative work which will meet the needs both of those familiar with the field and those new to it.
