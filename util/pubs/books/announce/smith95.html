This message announces the publication of the book, SPOKEN NATURAL LANGUAGE 
DIALOG SYSTEMS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH by Ronnie W. Smith and D. Richard Hipp, 
that is available from Oxford University Press, ISBN # 0-19-509187-6.

This book addresses dialog issues that must be resolved in building effective
spoken natural language dialog systems.  It presents an architecture for
dialog processing for which an implementation has been constructed that
exhibits a number of behaviors required for efficient human-machine dialog
including:

* problem solving to help the user carry out a task
* coherent subdialog movement during the problem solving process
* user model usage to determine what is known by the user and what must be told
* expectation usage for contextual interpretation and error correction
* variable initiative behavior for interacting with users of differing 
  expertise

In the past, these problems have tended to be studied in isolation.  The
primary research contribution of this book is the presentation of a global
architecture for which solutions to these problems are integrated into a
single self-consistent mechanism.  There is a system implementation based on
this model that was experimentally evaluated using eight different users
engaged in a total of 141 problem-solving tasks.  Detailed results on the
system's performance in these dialogs are included.

BONUS FEATURE:  We have made the code for the system available by anonymous
FTP.  The dialog processing component consist of over 17000 lines of Prolog
and a view lines of C.  The parser consists of over 7600 lines of C.
Instructions on acquiring the code are given below.  To use the system
requires version 3.1.4 of Quintus Prolog and version 2.5.2 of the gcc compiler
for C (operating under UNIX operating system).  

There is indexing documentation within the code that relates the code to the 
model description in the book.  While you can look through the code without 
reference to the book, the system implementation will (hopefully), be 
more understandable when studied in conjunction with the book.  We hope it 
will be of interest to other researchers and to software and systems
developers interested in natural language dialog, spoken or typewritten.

*****************************************************************************
TO ACQUIRE AND USE SYSTEM CODE

1. Make your current directory on your machine the one which will be the root 
   directory of the system software 
 
2. ftp to the host machine duke.cs.duke.edu 
 
3. Use anonymous as your login name with your email address as password 
 
4. cd to pub/rws/system. 
 
5. set the transfer mode to binary 
 
6. get the file dlgsys.sh.Z 
 
7. Uncompress dlgsys.sh.Z with the UNIX uncompress program 
 
8. Extract the files from dlgsys.sh via the command /bin/sh dlgsys.sh, 
 
9. Setup the files into the correct directories via the command 
   /bin/sh setup.sh, 
 
The system is designed to help users repair errors in a circuit on a Radio
Shack 160 and one electronic project kit.

NOTE: there is an uncompressed version of the code available as well stored
      as dlgsys.sh.  Also, be sure to look at README file for further info.
      The code and documentation is likely to be updated periodically.

PLEASE email me with ANY comments/suggestions/questions you may have.
