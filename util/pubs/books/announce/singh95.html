			      MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
     A Theoretical Framework for Intentions, Know-How, and Communications

Multiagent systems are drawing much research attention these days.  This
monograph is about some of the key technical aspects of multiagent systems.
For a variety of reasons, anthropomorphic cognitive concepts can provide
useful high-level abstractions for dealing with complex systems.  Indeed,
reasoning about knowledge has found its way into mainstream distributed
computing.  However, to be fruitfully applied in computational settings,
anthropomorphic terms must be given rigorous technical definitions.

This monograph develops a semantics for two primitives -- intentions and
know-how -- in a general model of actions and time.  Key consequences of this
semantics include a characterization of the nontrivial conditions under which
an agent's intentions may succeed, and the observation that intentions and
know-how are essentially independent.  These definitions are used also to
provide a semantics for the different modes of communication, such as promises
and prohibitions.  The proposed framework involves actions, possible and
actual, abstract and concrete, that agents perform.  This enables one to use
intentions, know-how, and communications in stating constraints on system
behavior that more naturally capture users' requirements.  The proposed
framework can thus serve as a foundation on which to develop specific
approaches and methodologies for specifying, designing, and implementing
complex systems.

This monograph has been made accessible to a wide audience, including graduate
students and researchers in computer science (especially, artificial
intelligence and distributed computing) and cognitive science.  The focus of
the work is in computer science, however.  No special background is required
beyond a familiarity with logic and some mathematical maturity.  A knowledge
of temporal and modal logic would help, but is not essential.
