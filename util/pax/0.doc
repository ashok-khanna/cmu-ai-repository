Package:      util/pax/

Name:         PAX

Summary:      Portable Archive Interchange

Version:      2.0 (26-FEB-90)

Description: 

    Pax is an archiving utility that reads and writes tar and cpio formats, 
    both the traditional ones and the extended formats specified in IEEE 
    1003.1.  It handles multi-volume archives and automatically determines 
    the format of an archive while reading it.  Three user interfaces are 
    supported: tar, cpio, and pax.  The pax interface was designed by IEEE 
    1003.2 as a compromise in the chronic controversy over which of tar or 
    cpio is best.

Requires:     ANSI C and POSIX.

Ports:        Runs on IBM PC, Unix systems (e.g., HP 9000, Sun, Vax,
              SGI), Macintosh II (A/UX), and many more.
