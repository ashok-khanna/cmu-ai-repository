Name:           9660_u

Summary:        ISO-9660 CD-ROM Utilities

Version:        1.1

Description:

  Bill Siegmund dug into the ISO-9660 documentation and pulled out enough
  information to write some low-level user-mode code for reading ISO-9660
  discs.  Rich Morin tweaked the code a bit and added some shell scripts as
  frosting.  Neither Bill nor Rich is totally happy with the results, but
  they agree that it is far better than nothing, and give it to you as a
  starting point, tool, or what have you.

              Bill is willing to make up MS-DOS floppies of the code, for a 
              small fee.  Rich will email the code upon request.  The current
              version is available in directory /pub/ptf/ on ftp.cdrom.com.
