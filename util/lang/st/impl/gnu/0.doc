Package:      lang/st/impl/gnu/

Name:         GNU Smalltalk

Summary:      GNU's implementation of Smalltalk

Version:      Unix 1.1.1 (15-SEP-91); DOS 1.1.1 (12-SEP-93)

Description: 

   A free and portable C implementation of Smalltalk, from the folks at GNU.

   GNU Smalltalk attempts to be a reasonably faithful implementation of
   Smalltalk-80 as described in the "Blue Book", also know as
   "Smalltalk-80, the Language and its Implementation", by Adele Goldberg
   and David Robson.  The syntax that the language accepts and the byte
   codes that the virtual machine interprets are exactly as they appear
   in the Blue Book.  Most of the primitives are the same as well,
   although due to the differing nature of the implementation some of the
   primitives haven't been implemented, and other new ones have been.

   GNU Smalltalk includes an incremental garbage collector, binary image
   save capability, C-callout (allows Smalltalk to invoke user-written C
   code and pass parameters to it), GNU Emacs editing mode, optional byte
   code compilation tracing and byte code execution tracing,
   automatically loaded per-user initialization files, and STIX (the
   SmallTalk Interface to X).
