   The bibliography can be searched using either WAIS or GOPHER. 
      1. To search the lp-proceedings using WAIS, use the
            lp-proceedings.src 
         WAIS source, available from the directory of servers. 
      2. To search the lp-proceedings using GOPHER, point the client
         to
            gopher.fct.unl.pt, 
         and follow the directories 
            "Research/Bibliography/Logic Programming Proceedings".
   Searching should be easier than retrieving the entire package every
   time you want to locate a particular article.
