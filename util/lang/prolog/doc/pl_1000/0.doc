Summary:      The Prolog 1000 database of real Prolog applications

Version:      v1

Description: 

   The Prolog 1000 is a database of real Prolog applications being
   assembled in conjunction with the Association for Logic Programming
   (ALP) and Prolog Vendors Group (PVG). The aim is to demonstrate how
   Prolog is being used in the real world and it already contains over
   500 programs with well over 2 million lines of code. The database is
   in SGML format.

   If you have or know about a program that might qualify for inclusion,
   send an email message to any of the contacts listed below for an
   electronic entry form which only takes a few minutes to complete.
   (Floppy disks for PC or Mac in text form are also welcome, and paper
   entries may also be sent).

   They would like to know who is using the information and are cautious
   about supplying ready-made address lists, so full addresses for the
   authors are not included in the database. This information is
   available upon request from the contacts below.
