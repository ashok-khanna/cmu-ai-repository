Package:      lang/prolog/code/library/

Name:         Prolog Library

Summary:      A collection of Prolog programs from the defunct Prolog-Hackers
              mailing list.

Version:      21-AUG-90

Description: 

   This directory contains a collection of Prolog programs from the
   now-defunct Prolog Hackers mailing list. Fernando Pereira maintained
   the collection.  Many of the programs are over 10 years old. The
   programs were originally tested on DEC-10s and DEC-20s with the
   Edinburgh Prolog system. Compatibility with modern Prologs has not
   been tested, but most of the programs should run with only minor
   changes. Some of the files in this package have been duplicated
   elsewhere in the Prolog Repository, but we felt it was important to
   retain the package intact despite the duplication.

   The library includes implementations of trace, advice, macro
   expansion, gensym, heaps, sorting, queues, random number generators,
   set manipulation routines, splay trees, binary trees, and association
   lists. There's also an implementation of Mackworth's AC-3 algorithm,
   several debuggers, a Prolog parser, a top-level loop, graph processing
   utilities, a metacircular interpreter for Prolog, a program for
   converting formulae in FOPC to clausal form, a translator from
   Definite Clause Grammars to Prolog, a compiler for Flat Concurrent
   Prolog, routines for structure crunching, a rational arithmetic
   package, an algebraic expression simplifier, a pretty printer,
   tutorial programs, cross-referencing programs, a Prolog lint, and a
   Prolog type checker.  The library also includes the ECRC benchmarks,
   the WGSYM (Information Processing Society of Japan) Lisp/Prolog
   benchmarks, and the Tektronix/Portland State University benchmarks.
   Among the documents are the user's manual for Edinburgh Prolog on the
   DEC-10, the original Scribe draft manuscript for a Prolog standard
   by O'Keefe, and a few bibliographies.
