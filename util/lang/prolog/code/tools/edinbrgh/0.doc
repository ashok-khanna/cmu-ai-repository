Summary:      Edinburgh DEC-10 Prolog utility library.

Version:      6-JUL-88

Description: 

   The Edinburgh DEC-10 Prolog Library is a large collection of Prolog
   routines, written largely by researchers and students in Alan Bundy's
   Mathematical Reasoning Group at the Department of Artificial
   Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. 

   These programs are all examples of using Prolog programming to deal
   with objects and problems of many kinds. Some of them are very good
   examples, others are not so; some are well commented, some have
   separate documentation, some have none. You may be able to load the
   tools for low-level operations into your code ready-made, or you may
   not.  Browsing through the code will give you an insight into how to
   write good Prolog programs.

   The Edinburgh Library includes programs for data structure definition
   and manipulation, the input and output of structured and unstructured
   data, and extensions to Prolog and definitions of parts of the
   Prolog system in Prolog. It also includes files relating to the
   development of Prolog programs and demonstration and teaching materials.

   Programs include advice, a metacircular interpreter for maintaining
   extended and-or trees, an implementation of Mackworth's AC-3
   algorithm, Winston's arch, association lists, missionaries and
   cannibals, a program for bundling/unbundling files, a program for
   converting FOPC formulas to clausal form, a program for solving
   cryptarithms, implementation of Definite Clause Slash Grammar, the
   DEC-10 compatibility file for C-Prolog 1.4a, the 8-puzzle, Evans'
   geometric analogy program, simple macro expansion, random number
   generators, an implementation of gensym, graph processing utilities,
   an implementation of heaps, an implementation of intelligent
   backtracking, an interactive cross referencer, lazy lists, list
   handling utilities, a Logo-like inference package, rational
   arithmetic, an elementary module system, an implementation of Mycin,
   ordered set manipulation, an implementation of tic tac toe, a pretty
   printer, the N-Queens problem, queue operations, a tokenizer, a
   production system, sorting routines, an algebraic expression
   simplifier, a code profiler (timer), a toplevel loop, trace, binary
   trees, a Prolog type checker, an implementation of unit resolution, a
   conditional plan generator, and formatted output.
