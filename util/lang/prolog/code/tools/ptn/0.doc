Summary:      Parse Tree Notation

Version:      25-MAY-94

Description: 

   Parse Tree Notation (PTN) facilitates the encoding of language
   translators which transform programs written in high level languages
   with extensions (e.g. a logic language with functional programming
   features) into equivalent programs in the original unextended languages
   (e.g. Prolog). PTN does this by offering a small set of operations and
   built-in predicates for manipulating program parse trees. More
   complicated actions can be readily coded by combining PTN with Prolog
   predicates.

   The main PTN operation augments unification with pattern matching
   capabilities based on the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) for the
   language of the program being manipulated. This allows parse tree
   searches to be specified, based on the terminal and nonterminal types
   of the language, without the programmer having to augment the DCG or to
   write specialized tree manipulation predicates.

   There are numerous example translators in the distribution, including:
      -  a translator for a simple functional LP language
      -  a translator for a  LP language with modules
      -  a text analyzer for grades
      -  a translator for an if-then rule-based system
      -  a text analyzer for phone lists
      -  a translator for a LP language with attribute/name arguments
      -  a translator that adds proof tree arguments to programs

   PTN notation in a translator is itself translated into vanilla Prolog
   using a PTN translator.

Requires:     NU-Prolog

Ports:        Uses mostly ISO-standard Prolog built-ins, and so should
              be easy to port.
