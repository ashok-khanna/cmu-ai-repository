CASLOG (Complexity Analysis System for LOGic) is an experimental
semi-automatic complexity analysis system for logic programs. It can
perform the worst-case analysis for complexity measures: argument size
complexity, number of solutions complexity, and time complexity.

CASLOG extends the techniques developed for analyzing imperative and
functional languages to deal with nondeterminism and generation of
multiple solutions via backtracking in logic languages. The analyses
for different complexity measures are implemented in a unified
framework and share several common features. First, the predicates in
a program are processed in an order generated by a bottom-up
topological sorting over the call graph of the program. Second, the
complexity function for a predicate is derived from the complexity
function of its clauses by using the information about the mutual
exclusion relationships between its clauses. Third, the complexity
function for a clause is inferred based on the data dependency
relationships between its literals. Fourth, the complexity functions
for recursive clauses are in the form of difference equations and are
transformed into closed form functions using difference equation
solving techniques. This unified framework can simplify proofs of
correctness and the implementation of the algorithms.
