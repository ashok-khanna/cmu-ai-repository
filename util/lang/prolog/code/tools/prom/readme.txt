PROM is designed as a stand-alone tool with a command line interface.
PROM is based on SWI-Prolog, but might be ported to other Prolog systems,
too.

Version 1.1 of PROM is based on version 1.5.9 of SWI-Prolog resulting
in an easier installation.

PROM is available under terms similar to the ones of the GNU public license.

The distribution as of 13 Oct 93 has the documentation added in PostScript
