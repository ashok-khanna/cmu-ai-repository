Name:         FW_Rules

Summary:      Support for Forward Chaining Rules in Prolog

Version:      1.1 (5-DEC-94)

Description: 

   FW_RULES is a Sicstus Prolog library providing a compiler for forward
   chaining rules.  The implementation is based on a non-state saving
   technique coupled with an indexing mechanism on the working memory
   based on C bitwise operations to achieve efficiency. The library
   supports interoperability between the forward chaining language and
   the underlying Prolog engine.  Terms in the working memory are
   represented as Prolog facts and can be accessed from Prolog to perform
   deduction.

Requires:     Sicstus Prolog 2.1 #9
