Summary:      Prolog 2-3 Trees Package

Version:      21-AUG-91

Description: 

   This package contains a set of Prolog predicates for associating
   keys with values using 2-3 trees. Because 2-3 trees are used, they
   automatically rebalance after each insertion or deletion.

   For example,

       ?-
       list_to_23( [ cat-dog,
                     hare-rabbit,
                     "hair"-"fur",
                     king-queen,
                     exp(1)-2.71828,
                     3.141593-pi
                   ],
                   Tree
                 ),
       portray_23( Tree ),
       put_23( 39, Tree, steps, Tree1 ),
       portray_23( Tree1 ).

   gives

       23 Tree{
         3.141593 - pi
         cat - dog
         hare - rabbit
         king - queen
         exp(1) - 2.71828
         [104, 97, 105, 114] - [102, 117, 114]
       }

       23 Tree{
         3.141593 - pi
         39 - steps
         cat - dog
         hare - rabbit
         king - queen
         exp(1) - 2.71828
         [104, 97, 105, 114] - [102, 117, 114]
       }

   There is no routine for deleting items from a tree (you can replace
   them), but it would not be hard to write one.
