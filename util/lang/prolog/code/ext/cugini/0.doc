Summary:      NBS/ICST Prolog Utility Library

Version:      30-JUL-88

Description: 

   This package contains various utility predicates, some commonly used,
   some not. They deal with lists, structures, I/O, sets, numeric
   facilities, and some extensions of logic and control. 

   Predicates include member; append; maplist; other list-handling
   predicates; predicates for handling sets represented as lists;
   type-testing predicates; sorting and merging; readline; a predicate
   for getting the printable representation of a term; rational number
   predicates; and meta-logical predicates for dealing with true
   disjunction and negation.

Requires:     

Ports:        Originally for C-Prolog. Should run in
              Edinburgh-compatible Prologs.
