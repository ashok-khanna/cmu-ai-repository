Summary:      Prolog sets-as-interval predicates

Version:      21-DEC-87

Description: 

   This package defines predicates for manipulating sets of integers,
   represented as lists of disjoint intervals. This is a compact way of
   representing large sets, provided that they contain few gaps between
   intervals.

   Here are two examples of the representation:

      Set                                         Representation

      { -32768 .. 32767 }                         [ -32768--32767 ]

      { 1,3,4,5,9,10,11,12,15,16,100,101,102}     [ 1--1, 3--5, 9--12, 
                                                    15--16, 100--102 ]


   The predicates in this package include ones for forming the union,
   intersection, and difference of such sets, and for various operations
   on single intervals.

   For efficiency, the sets are kept in a canonical form. The intervals
   are disjoint, and are in ascending order, and form a minimal covering
   (i.e., there is no other representation of a set, using fewer
   intervals). There is a predicate for converting a list of arbitrary
   unordered intervals into a canonical form.

   The predicates are useful when writing programs for syntax-directed
   translation of character data. For example, some tag field on a line
   may specify that the line is a record of type R1 if the field lies in
   the set C1 of characters, or a record of type R2 if the field lies in
   the set C2 of characters, and so on. Using these predicates, one can
   check for ambiguous specifications by testing whether C1 and C2
   overlap; and one can generate quick tests for whether some character
   is in C1 or C2 by knowing that the set are represented by as few
   intervals as possible.
