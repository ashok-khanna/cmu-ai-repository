Summary:      Collection of Prolog code for parsing.

Description:

   This directory contains parsing-related code for Prolog. The
   emphasis is more on code-related parsing than on natural language
   parsing. (Although some of the parsers can serve dual purposes.)
   But some systems, like ALE, serve dual purposes, so we decided
   (arbitrarily) to keep them here.
