Summary:      Partial evaluator for flowchart language

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains Prolog code for the partial evaluator for
   the flowchart language described in Chapter 4 of

      N.D. Jones, C.K. Gomard, and P. Sestoft, "Partial Evaluation and
      Automatic Program Generation" Prentice Hall International 1993. 415
      pages, ISBN 0-13-020249-5 ($44.95).

   All three Futamura projections are implemented. 

   See ACM Computing Reviews July 1994, item 9407-0420.

Requires:     

Ports:        The code has been tested under SWI Prolog 1.5 and 1.7
              and should hopefully port to other Prologs without too
              many problems.
