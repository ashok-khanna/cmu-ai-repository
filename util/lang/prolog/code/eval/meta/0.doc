Summary:      Meta-circular interpreter for Prolog

Version:      2-MAR-84

Description: 

   This directory contains a genuinely meta-circular interpreter for a
   subset of Prolog containing cuts.  It relies on the fact that
   disjunction is transparent to cut just like conjunction.  

   If it doesn't work in your Prolog, and if you paid more than $100 for
   it, take your Prolog back to the shop and insist that they fix it,
   there are at least four different ways of implementing disjunction so
   that it works.
