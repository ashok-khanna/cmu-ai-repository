Package:      lang/prolog/code/math/graph/

Name:         

Summary:      Prolog graph-handling routines

Version:      12-JAN-91

Description: 

   This package contains two programs: one for decomposing a non-weighted
   directed graph into strongly connected components; and the other for
   finding simple and elementary cycles in a strongly connected component.

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs in SICStus Prolog, which is Quintus compatible and
              hence uses the `standard' Edinburgh syntax. Some of the
              I/O is non-portable.

   The programs are commented, but a basic knowledge of graph theory
   would be useful. The following are the most important references for
   the algorithms behind the programs.
