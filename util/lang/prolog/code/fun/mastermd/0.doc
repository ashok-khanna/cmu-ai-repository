Summary:      Prolog program that plays the Mastermind code-breaking game.

Version:      21-AUG-83

Description: 

   This program implements the game of Mastermind. Either the user or the
   program tries to break a hidden color code, consisting of the colors
   black, blue, red, green, yellow, white. The results of a guess (black:
   a color is at the right position; or white: a color occurs in the
   code) are internally represented as successors of 0. This could be
   extended to handle integers. When the program is making guesses, it
   uses a simple but powerful generate-and-test procedure, where the
   scores for previous attempts are used as the test criterion.
