Name:         RUBIK

Summary:      Prolog solution to Rubik's Cube by AMZI!

Version:      

Description: 

   Cube Solver II is a Prolog program that solves Rubik's Cube.
   It includes ready-to-run executables for 386 and 486 PCs, as well
   as full Prolog source code. If you want to use the sources on Unix,
   you'll need to unpc them (remove the extra carriage returns).  

Requires:     

Ports:        The source includes a simple scrolling interface that
              should work in any Edinburgh standard Prolog. The
              ready-made executables were implemented using Cogent Prolog.
