Name:         AUTOTEST

Summary:      Prolog predicate auto-tester

Version:      20-FEB-88

Description: 
    
   This program reads a file or files of Prolog goals, where each goal is
   accompanied by a specification saying whether it should succeed, fail,
   cause an error, or pass some tests on its bound variables.

   For each goal/specification pair, the program calls the goal, and
   compares its effect against the specification. If they differ, then a
   warning message is displayed. This is useful for automatically testing
   predicates against their expected outputs - the test files can be
   kept, and re-run every time a predicate is changed.

   As an example, a test file for 'functor', and good old 'append' and
   'member' might contain these lines:

       append( [], [1,2,3], [1,2,3] ) :: succeeds.
       append( [1,2,3], [], [1,2,3] ) :: succeeds.
       append( [1,2], [3,4,5], [1,2,3,4,5] ) :: succeeds.

       member( any, [] ) :: fails.
       member( any, [a,b,c,d,e,any] ) :: succeeds.
       member( any, [a,b,c,d,e] ) :: fails.

       functor( f(1,2), F, A ) :: F = f, A = 2.
