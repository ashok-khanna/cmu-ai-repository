Summary:      GRIPS -- A functional language in Prolog

Version:      11-JAN-91

Description: 

   GRIPS is a pre-processor for translating a functional version of
   Prolog into Prolog.  By using it, you can eliminate the tedium of
   having to think up variables to pass output from one predicate to the
   input of the next, and of having to flatten nested arithmetic 
   expressions into a sequence of machine-code-like assignments.

   Here are two example definitions.

           factorial(N) <- 1 if N =< 0.
           factorial(N) <- N * factorial(N-1) if N > 0.

           count( [] ) <- 0.
           count( [_|T] ) <- 1 + count(T).

   You can load these by doing 'grips_consult' or 'grips_reconsult' on the
   file they're in. You could then run the interpreter:

           ?- grips.
           |: do grips_reconsult('test.pl').
           Done
           |: factorial(3).
           Result = 6.
           |: factorial(factorial(3)).
           Result = 720.
           |: count( [a,b,c,d] ).
           Result = 4.
           |: 1 + count([a,b,c,d])/factorial(3).
           Result = 1.66667.
           |: pr( factorial(3,F) ).

           F = 6
           More (y/n)? |: y
           no
           |:

   A simple compiler written in GRIPS is available separately.
