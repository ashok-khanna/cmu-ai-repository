Package:      lang/prolog/code/syntax/compiler/

Name:         GRIPS Compiler

Summary:      Grips/Prolog demonstration mini-compiler.

Version:      11-JAN-91

Description: 

   This is a demonstration compiler, written in a functional language
   (GRIPS) that can be translated into Prolog.  The GRIPS translator is
   available separately.

   The compiler takes programs in a (very small) subset of Pascal.  It
   lexically analyzes them into tokens, parses the token list into a
   tree, generates code from the tree, fixes up references in the code,
   and then interprets the code on a stack virtual machine. It displays
   the output of each stage, and the interpreter displays the machine
   state as each instruction is obeyed.

   The compiler is written in a functional style, using functions
   (sometimes represented as sets of domain->codomain pairs) to represent
   well-known concepts in programming language semantics, such as the
   store and the environment.  

   Here is an example program that it can compile and run.

       program p;

       label
           99, 100;

       const
           five = 5;

       var
           v : integer;
           w : integer;

       begin
           write('Hello.');
           v := 1;
           w := 1;
       99:
               if v=five then goto 100;
               v := v + 1;
               w := w * v;
               goto 99;
       100:
           write('v = ');
           write(v);
           write('v! = ');
           write(w)
       end.
