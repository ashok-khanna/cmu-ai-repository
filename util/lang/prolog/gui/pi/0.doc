Summary:      Prolog interfaces to X-Windows

Version:      PI -- 1.2 (16-SEP-93); YToolkit (25-May-93)

Description: 

   PI (Portable Interfaces for Prolog applications) is an interface
   between Prolog applications and the X Window System that aims to be
   independent from the Prolog engine, provided that it has a
   Quintus-style foreign function interface (such as SICStus, YAP).  It
   is mostly written in Prolog and is divided into two libraries:

      1. Edipo, a low-level interface to the Xlib functions that allows
         you to create and manage windows, use graphical primitives, and 
         receive events, and 

      2. Ytoolkit, a high-level user interface toolkit that allows you to
         create and manage graphical objects, define new classes of objects,
         and handle user interaction. 

Requires:     Quintus-style foreign function interface.

Ports:        PI has been tested in Quintus Prolog 3.1.1 and SICStus 2.1 #8.
