Package:      lang/prolog/gui/xwip/

Name:         XWIP

Summary:      X-Windows Interface for PROLOG.

Version:      0.6.2 (6-APR-93)

Description: 

   XWIP (X Window Interface for Prolog) allows Prolog to be used as a
   client program for the X Windows System. The additional functions it
   provides are similar in form to the Xlib C language library.

   XWIP is written in Prolog and partly in the C language. XWIP uses a
   foreign function interface to allow the Prolog code to call the C
   code. The C code in turn calls the Xlib C language library. 

   [In the old/ subdirectory are versions 0.6 (X11 R5), patch1 for 0.6, 
   0.5 (X11 R4), and 0.4 (X11 R3).]

Requires:     X Windows, Xlib library, C compiler

Ports:        Tested on Sparc (SunOS 4.1.1) with X11 R5 and Quintus
              3.0 or SICStus 0.7. It also runs under ECliPSe.
              There are a number of Quintus dependencies, especially
              in the foreign function interface and save program features.
