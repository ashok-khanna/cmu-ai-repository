A new version 1.3 of ProTcl is now available. ProTcl is an interface between
Prolog and Tcl/Tk, which loads the X11 Tcl/Tk toolkit dynamically into a Prolog
session. It is written mainly for Eclipse, but it also works with SICStus
and Quintus foreign interface.

Changes in 1.3:
- most of the configuration is now automated
- it is possible to start the toolkit without a display, and it is then
  equivalent to pure Tcl
- ProTcl supports also statical linking with Prolog, for machines that have
  troubles loading it dynamically (HP).
