Description: 

   POEM (Prolog Object-Oriented Embedded Manager) is a simple
   object-oriented programming package for Prolog. It includes notions of
   classes, objects, and subclasses, similar to Simula-67.  There is no
   error detection mechanism.

   POEM comes from a Poplog Users' Group tape in early 1987. (The
   original code is from 1985.) This version includes some small changes
   to improve portability suggested by Nick Youd of Cambridge
   University's Engineering Department.

Requires:     

Ports:        Edinburgh-compatible Prologs.
