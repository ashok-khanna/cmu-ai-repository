Summary:      Object Layer for Prolog

Version:      1.1 (23-JUN-93)

Description: 

   OL(P), Object Layer for Prolog, is an object-oriented extension to
   Prolog.  It provides an object-oriented structuring and reuse
   mechanism for Prolog in a manner that preserves performance and
   semantics. The object-oriented layer is compiled into Prolog without
   introducing any side-effects.  OL(P) takes the view of objects as
   collections of predicates (called methods).  To Prolog, OL(P) adds
   objects with methods, data encapsulation, instances, and multiple
   inheritance. Object methods can access Prolog predicates and vice
   versa. The OL(P) incremental compiler translates OL(P) programs to
   Prolog programs that don't need runtime interpretation (e.g., no
   search is needed for inheritance).  OL(P) comes with source code,
   documentation, simple built-in project management, some libraries,
   and example programs.
