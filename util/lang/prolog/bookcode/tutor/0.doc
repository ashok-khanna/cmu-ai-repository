Name:         TUTOR

Summary:      Jocelyn Paine's Logic Programming Tutor

Version:      

Description: 

   This is the program described in Jocelyn Paine's book
      Jocelyn Paine, "The Logic Programming Tutor", Intellect, 1992
   published by Intellect in the UK and Kluwer elsewhere. It is a
   front-end designed to introduce novices to Prolog, and can accept
   facts and questions in either Prolog or infix "Logic", translating
   between the two. It has a simple number-editor (Basic-like), and a
   portable screen-editor. It also comes with a set of eight "scripts".
   These are lessons which it displays one section at a time, inviting
   the student to try doing simple exercises, or to try experiments with
   Prolog.

   The distribution also includes some auxiliary software, including a
   trading game, several example knowledge bases, a copy of Dave Bowen
   and Chris Mellish's cross-referencing program, a Prolog 'lint', an
   autotester, a profiler for timing goals (based on chapter 3 of "The
   Craft of Prolog"), and a random number generator.

   Also included is LaTeX source for the supplementary exercises and
   notes from Paine's book.

Requires:     

Ports:        Any Edinburgh-compatible Prolog.
