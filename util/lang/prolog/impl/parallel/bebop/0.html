The BeBOP language combines the features of sequential and parallel
Logic Programming (LP), object oriented programming and meta-level
programming. The goal of the system is to support the construction of
multi-agent systems. 

The LP component offers both don't know non-determinism and stream
AND-parallelism, a combination not possible with concurrent LP
languages. BeBOP's object oriented features include object IDs,
encapsulation, message passing, state updating, and object behavior
modification. The meta-level capabilities are based on the treatment
of Prolog theories as first order entities, which enables them to be
updated easily, and for fragments to be passed between objects in
messages.

An interactive interpreter named BP is included in the distribution.
It supports incremental compilation and execution, and allows the
communication links within an object network to be specified
dynamically. BP also includes a history mechanism, allowing
syntactically correct goals to be repeated, listed, and modified.
Variables from previous queries can also be reused in later queries.
BP is a superset of NU-Prolog's interpreter NP and so can seamlessly
combine objects and prolog goals.

BeBOP programs are compiled into NU-Prolog, and its parallel
extension, PNU-Prolog (PNP). An unusual aspect of this is the way in
which object IDs are utilized as a communication mechanism between
objects. Code for the PNP preprocessor is included in the distribution. 

NU-Prolog (AKA MU-Prolog) is a prolog interpreter implemented in C for
BSD Unix available from the University of Melbourne.  Source licenses
are available for educational institutions.  For more information,
