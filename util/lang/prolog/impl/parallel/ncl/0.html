<H2>NCL: Net-Clause Language</H2>

NCL (Net-Clause Language) is aimed at describing distributed
computation models using term unification as a basic processing and
control mechanism. It is embedded in standard Prolog and comprises two
parts -- net-clauses and data-driven rules, which can communicate each
to other and to standard Prolog programs through the unified
representation of terms, the unification procedure and the database
mechanism provided by Prolog.

A net-clause is a special domain in the database defining a network of
nodes and links. The nodes are represented by Prolog compound terms.
The variables occurring within the nodes are global logical variables,
which can be shared within the scope of the net-clause thus playing
the role of network links. The net-clause nodes define local
conditions for unification of terms or execution of Prolog goals.

Thus two basic control mechanisms are implemented: 

   - A spreading activation scheme similar to the connectionist
     spreading activation and to the marker passing mechanism in
     semantic nets. In the framework of logic programming it is
     seen as a restricted (no recursion) forward chaining
     computation.

   - A default mechanism based on using variables to propagate
     terms without being bound to them, thus implementing the
     non-monotonicity of default reasoning. This is similar to
     Reiter's default assignment to variables.

The Data-driven Rules implement a full scale forward chaining for Horn
clauses.  They simulate a data-driven parallel computation, where each
rule is a process (in contrast to the traditional parallel logic
programming, like PARLOG, where each goal is a process).

It is worth noting that NCL/Prolog is implemented in C as an augmented
Prolog interpreter together with some Prolog routines, so it can also
be used as a Prolog interpreter.

NCL includes several annotated example programs: natural language
parsing and semantic analysis, model-based diagnosis of a binary
adder, 4-queens problem, recognition of geometric figures, and
data-driven inductive learning.
