<H2>BAP: Parallel Prolog for Transputer Networks</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/prolog/impl/parallel/bap/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
Brain Aid Prolog (BAP) is a Concurrent Sequential Processes (CSP)
based standard Prolog for Transputer networks. BAP uses its own MS
Windows or X Windows server for I/O. Special features include
automatic topology adapation and concurrent source level debugging
(see several processes exchange messages). Performance is pretty high,
comparable to that of other Prolog compilers. BAP has achieved good
results (>80% efficiency) when executing applications like N-queens or
checkers in parallel on an 8 processor network.

This directory contains a demo version with host server running under
MS-Windows that supports Transputer systems with a maximum of 2
processors.  A B004 compatible interface is required to connect to a
PC. Both Parsytec and INMOS reset schemes are supported.  The host
server provides multi-process I/O and interactive source level
debugging of several processes.  A Windows help file is included that
treats installation, quickstart and parallel programming paradigms.

A full version for up to 128 nodes is available now for both UNIX
(e.g., Sun, Linux, ...) and PC.  Write to the contact for more information.

Version:      1.2d (14-AUG-94)

Requires:     The BAP system runs on networks of 32bit Tranputers (T4
              or T8) with 2MB of RAM per node, although 4MB is recommended.
              
              The Demonstration Version includes Host Server for
              MS-Windows PC's connected to the network via a INMOS
              B004 or compatible board. This Host PC should have at
              least 4MB Memory and 10MB free disk space.

Copying:      The demo version is for evaluation purposes and private
              use only at at your own risk. It may be freely copied
              and distributed. (See the file read.me for details.)
              
              The Programmer's File Editor PFE by Alan Phillips is
              distributed with BAP, but is not part of the BAP system
              and has a separate license. See the pfe subdirectory in
              the distribution for more information.
