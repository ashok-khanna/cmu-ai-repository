The ftp distribution of BRAIN AID PROLOG consists of two zip files
containing images of the installation disks for MSWindows:
BAP12D1.ZIP
BAP12D2.ZIP
Get both files from your ftp server and expand them either to two floppy
disks (1.2MB od 1.44MB) using pkunzip or expand to directories ./disk1 and
./disk2 on your hard disk. 
The first disk contains a file SETUP.EXE which will start up windows 
(if not allready running) and begin installation.
Further information can be found in the files READ.ME and RELEASE.TXT
included in the distribution.
 
We will be glad to provide further information.
