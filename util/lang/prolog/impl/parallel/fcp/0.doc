Name:         FCP

Summary:      Flat Concurrent Prolog

Version:      16-MAY-84

Description: 

   This directory contains a compiler for Flat Concurrent Prolog.  It
   compiles FCP clauses into PROLOG clauses and executes these according
   to the definition of FCP. The FCP to PROLOG compiler is a modification
   of the Concurrent Prolog to PROLOG compiler of Chikayama implemented
   by Udi Shapiro & Colin Mierowsky.

   Flat Concurrent Prolog corresponds to the AND parallel subset of
   Concurrent Prolog. It was introduced in order to gain experience with
   a number of implementation issues relating to Concurrent Prolog and to
   provide a basis for experimentation with various distributed and
   parallel algorithms.

   An FCP program differs from a CP program in that guard systems contain
   only boolean combinations (conjunctions and negations) of simple test
   predicates (guard_kernel predicates). Declaratively, FCP programs are
   the same as CP programs, but differ procedurally.
