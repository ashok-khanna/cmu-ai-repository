<H2>Wild_LIFE: Implementation of LIFE, a programming language 
              that integrates functional programming, logic 
              programming, and object-oriented programming.</H2>

LIFE (Logic, Inheritance, Functions, and Equations) is an experimental
programming language with a powerful facility for structured type
inheritance. It reconciles styles from functional programming, logic
programming, and object-oriented programming. It subsumes, and fully
contains the functionality of, the precursor languages LOGIN and Le_Fun.
The syntax of Wild_LIFE has been kept as close as possible to that of the
Edinburgh family of Prolog so that Prolog compatibility is easy to
achieve.

From a theoretical point of view, LIFE implements a constraint logic
programming language with equality (unification) and entailment (matching)
constraints over order-sorted feature terms. The interplay of unification
and matching provides an implicit coroutining facility thanks to an
automatic suspension mechanism.  This allows interleaving interpretation
of relational and functional expressions which specify structural
dependencies on objects.

Wild_LIFE includes a set of non-trivial example programs including an
incremental Gaussian equation solver, a PERT scheduler, a full LIFE
parser, a flower-drawing program that handles X events, uses an X
toolkit and a 3D turtle graphics package written in LIFE and compiles
rewrite rules into LIFE. It also includes an extensive test suite to
verify the correct operation of the interpreter.
