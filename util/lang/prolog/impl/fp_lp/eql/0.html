<H2>EqL: General purpose language combining functional and

EqL is a general-purpose language that combines the capabilities of
functional and logic programming languages.  A program in EqL consists
of a collection of conditional, pattern-directed rules, where the
conditions are expressed as a conjunction of equations, and the
patterns are terms built up of data-constructors and basic values.

Due to its expressional syntax, EqL directly supports functional
programming.  EqL also supports logic programming, as all its
variables are 'logical variables' and Prolog-style nondeterminism is
allowed.  A limited form of constraint reasoning, going beyond
traditional functional and logic programming, is also supported.
Further details of the language are described in UNC TR 87-010.

The declarative semantics of a set of equations is expressed in terms
of its complete set of solutions. The computational paradigm in EqL is
equation solving, which may also be viewed as a form of 'innermost
narrowing', a restriction on narrowing that enables more efficient
computation of solutions (see the 1988 IEEE-SE paper for details).

The EqL interpreter runs about half as fast as the C-Prolog
interpreter on Vaxes and Suns, and has a modest number of features
to aid debugging and program testing.
