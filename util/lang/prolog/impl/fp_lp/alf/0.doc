Description: 

   ALF (Algebraic Logic/Functional programming language) is a programming
   language that combines functional and logic programming techniques.
   ALF is based on Horn clause logic with equality. Predicates and Horn
   clauses are used for logic programming, and functions and equations
   for functional programming. Any functional expression can be used in a
   goal literal, and any predicate can occur in the conditions of an
   equation. 

   The ALF system is implemented using a combination of resolution,
   narrowing, rewriting and rejection. The resolution rule is used to
   solve literals and narrowing to evaluate functional expressions.  The
   number of possible narrowing steps is reduced by a leftmost-innermost
   basic narrowing strategy, and terms are simplified by rewriting before
   narrowing is applied.  Equations are also rejected if the two sides
   have different constructors at the top.  Rewriting and rejection can
   result in a large reduction of the search tree.  Thus the operational
   semantics of ALF is more efficient than Prolog's resolution strategy.

   Like Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking strategy corresponding to a
   depth-first search in the derivation tree.  ALF programs are compiled
   into instructions of an abstract machine based on the Warren Abstract
   Machine (WAM) with several extensions to implement narrowing and
   rewriting. The emulator for A-WAM programs is written in C.
