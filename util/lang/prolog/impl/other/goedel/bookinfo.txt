THE GODEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Patricia Hill and John Lloyd


Godel is a new, general-purpose, declarative programming 
language that is based on the paradigm of logic programming 
and can be regarded as a successor to Prolog. This book gives 
a tutorial overview of Godel, presents example programs, 
provides a formal definition of the syntax and semantics of 
the language, and covers background material on logic.
  
The Godel language supports types and modules. It has a 
rich collection of system modules and provides constraint 
solving in several domains. It also offers metalogical 
facilities that provide significant support for metaprograms 
that do analysis, transformation, compilation, verification, 
debugging, and the like. The declarative nature of Godel 
makes it well suited for use as a teaching language, narrows 
the gap that currently exists between theory and practice in 
logic programming, makes possible advanced software 
engineering tools such as declarative debuggers and compiler 
generators, reduces the effort involved in providing a 
parallel implementation of the language, and offers 
substantial scope for parallelization in such 
implementations.
  
Patricia Hill is Senior Research Fellow in the School of 
Computer Studies at the University of Leeds. John Lloyd is 
Professor of Computer Science at the University of Bristol, 
and the author of Foundations of Logic Programming.
