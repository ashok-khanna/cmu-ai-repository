Name:         cu-Prolog III 

Summary:      Original ICOT version

Version:      CUP 3.1 (22-SEP-93); JPSG 1.3 (6-JUN-92)

Description: 

   cu-Prolog (Constraint Unification Prolog) is an experimental
   constraint logic programming language available free from Japan's
   Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT). Unlike most
   conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog allows user-defined predicates as
   constraints. cu-Prolog is a complete implementation of Constraint
   Unification (cu), hence the name.

   cu-Prolog is suitable for implementing a natural language processing
   system for unification-based grammars. For example, the cu-Prolog
   developers implemented a JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar)
   parser in cu-Prolog with the JPSG Working Group (headed by Prof.
   Takao Gunji of Osaka University) at ICOT.

   [Note: Japanese names have been rewritten in the order <first> <last>.]

   This directory contains the original version from ICOT for UNIX
   workstations. 

Requires:     

Ports:        cu-Prolog is implemented in C for BSD UNIX 4.2/3.
