Name:         cu-Prolog III

Summary:      Constraint Logic Programming Language cu-Prolog

Version:      

Description: 

   cu-Prolog (Constraint Unification Prolog) is an experimental
   constraint logic programming language available free from Japan's
   Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT). Unlike most
   conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog allows user-defined predicates as
   constraints. cu-Prolog is a complete implementation of Constraint
   Unification (cu), hence the name.

   cu-Prolog is suitable for implementing a natural language processing
   system for unification-based grammars. For example, the cu-Prolog
   developers implemented a JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar)
   parser in cu-Prolog with the JPSG Working Group (headed by Prof.
   Takao Gunji of Osaka University) at ICOT.

   [Note: Japanese names have been rewritten in the order <first> <last>.]

Requires:     

Ports:        cu-Prolog is implemented in C for BSD UNIX 4.2/3.
              Professor Sirai of Chukyo-University has ported
              cu-Prolog to the Apple Macintosh and DJ's GPP 
              (80386/486 MS-DOS machine with the DOS extender).
