Name:         LM-Prolog

Summary:      Prolog implemented in ZetaLisp for Lisp Machines.

Version:      4-JAN-90

Description: 

   LM-Prolog is an implementation of Prolog for the MIT family of Lisp
   Machines.  The Prolog dialect differs quite a bit from the Edinburgh
   Prolog family of dialects both in terms of syntax and built-in
   predicates.  The bulk of the code was written in 1983, when the
   authors were at Uppsala University.

   The implementation compiles Prolog predicates to Lisp functions, using
   success continuations to emulate the Prolog control structure.

   It is implemented in ZetaLisp and depends on features of ZetaLisp that
   will make it hard to port to Common Lisp, such as locatives, invisible
   pointers, and flavors.

   Examples include a Concurrent Prolog interpreter, Warren's
   benchmarks, Turtle graphics demos, and the Grammar Kit.

Requires:     

Ports:        LM-PROLOG is written in ZetaLisp and is not easily
              portable to Common Lisp.
