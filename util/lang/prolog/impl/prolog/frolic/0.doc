Name:         FROLIC

Summary:      Prolog implemented in Common Lisp and integrated with
              the FROBS knowledge representation system

Version:      19-AUG-93

Description: 

   FROLIC (Frobs + Logic) is an implementation of Prolog in Common Lisp
   that allows access to external knowledge bases. It was designed to
   provide a prolog-based interface to Frobs data structures. It uses
   a Lisp-like syntax instead of Prolog's syntax.

   Examples include a simple Eliza-like program.
