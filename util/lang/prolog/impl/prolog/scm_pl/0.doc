Name:         

Summary:      Prolog implemented in Scheme, with interval arithmetic.

Version:      1.2 (12-JUN-92)

Description: 

   Prolog in Scheme is a collection of macros that expand syntax for
   clauses, elations, and so on. It is written in Scheme and has support
   for delayed goals and interval arithmetic. It is known to run in Chez
   Scheme and in Elk, and is intended to be portable to other Scheme
   implementations. It relies on continuations, and so is not easily
   ported to Common Lisp. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Chez Scheme and Elk.
              Should be easily ported to other Scheme implementations.
