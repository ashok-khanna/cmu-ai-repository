The programming environment has benefited from public domain code
by R.A. O'Keefe. Ulrich Neumerkel wrote the iterative copy_term
algorithm used in BinProlog 3.00. Research results made public by
by D.H.D. Warren, Bart Demoen, Andre Marien, Mats Carlsson among others,
and theoretical work by researchers in the field of logic programming,
semantics of the programming languages and partial evaluation have
contributed to the design of the BinProlog engine. The 386-486 version
is created with the GNU gcc compiler and contains the go32 DOS-extender,
by D.J. Delorie. The Sparc and sun3 and Next versions are created
with the bundled C compilers. The Solaris version is created by the
gcc compiler.

Grants from the Canadian NSERC and the FESR of the Universite de Moncton
have supported in part the basic research that made this implementation
possible.
