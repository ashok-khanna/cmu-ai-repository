* For MS-Windows, take the file win-pl.zip.  This is a binary
  distribution.  There is no need to get the sources if you don't
  have the 32-bit WATCOM compiler or intend to do a lot of work
  porting the thing.

* Versions 1.8.9 and later are written in pure ANSI-C.  For old
  K&R C-compilers, stick with 1.8.8.

  There are no diffs between 1.8.8 and 1.8.9 as these would be
  enormous.
