Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/swi_pl/

Name:         SWI Prolog

Summary:      Fairly complete Edinburgh-style Prolog.

Version:      1.9 (5-JUN-94); 1.8.7 (31-JAN-93)

Description: 

   SWI-Prolog is a fairly complete Edinburgh-style Prolog. It includes a
   fast compiler, a profiler, a transparent and fast C interface (both
   Prolog calling C and C calling Prolog), a Quintus-like module system,
   garbage collector, stack expander, and dynamic autoloading of
   libraries.  It also includes a GNU-readline and GNU-Emacs interface.
   SWI-Prolog has a large set of built-in predicates in common with
   C-Prolog, Quintus and SICStus Prolog, so programs written for
   SWI-Prolog should be fairly portable to other prolog implementations.

   SWI-Prolog has no built-in facilities for graphics, but XPCE works
   with SWI-Prolog. (XPCE is a language-independent interface to X11 that
   provides a high level of abstraction.)

   The system has been very stable since version 1.5.  Most of the
   changes since then are new features and minor bug fixes.

Requires:     The MS-DOS port must be run in true 386-mode (it can't
              be run under MS Windows) and lacks some of the
              functionality of the Unix versions.  It is recommended
              that you run Linux instead.

              GNU-readline (kernel later than 99pl6) must be installed.
              It fails on gcc-2.5.[0123], but others are ok.

Ports:        Runs on Atari ST, Gould PN, NeXT, HP, IBM Linux, DEC MIPS, 
              IBM PS/2 AIX, OS/2, IBM RS/6000, Sun3, Sun4, Sparc, and Vax.
