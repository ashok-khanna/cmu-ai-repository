Summary:      Embedding of Prolog in Scheme

Version:      2 (18-FEB-93)

Description: 

   ScheLog is an implementation of Prolog in Scheme. It is a
   collection of macros that expand syntax for clauses, elations, and
   so on into pure Scheme. It should run in any R4RS Scheme, has been
   tested in SCM, and will run any Scheme implementation that supports
   SLIB (the Standard Scheme Library).

   This implementation uses Scheme's first-class full continuations to
   implement Prolog's backtracking mechanism. (See the papers in
   references below for information on this type of embedding.) Its use
   of higher-order continuations is probably a major obstacle to porting
   it to Common Lisp.   

   The file portable.tar contains sample initialization files that
   must be customized for your dialect of Scheme and loaded before
   runing Schelog. 

Requires:     

Ports:      Chez Scheme, SCM, and other R4RS Scheme implementations.
