This zoo contains a TEST distribution of version 2.5 of SB Prolog for the
Amiga.  This port was done by Nick Kline (kline@cs.arizona.edu) using
Aztec C 3.6a.  Again; this is a TEST distribution!  We did not have access
to an Amiga with sufficient RAM to fully validate the port, and would
appreciate your reports, positive and negative.  The following is the text
of the original UNIX SBProlog README file (obviously much of it does not
apply to Amiga SBProlog).  See the file notes_on_amiga_port for more
Amiga-specific info.

The code is in the file sbp2_5.zoo.  The binaries for the zoo archiver
are in the file amigazoo.
