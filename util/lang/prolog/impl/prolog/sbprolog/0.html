<H2>SB-Prolog: Stony Brook Prolog</H2>

SB-Prolog (Stony Brook Prolog) is a Prolog system for Unix and 386
MS-DOS systems. It is based on an extension of the Warren Abstract
Machine, which is written in C for enhanced portability.  The
remainder of the system, including the translator from Prolog to the
virtual machine instructions, is written in Prolog.  Prolog source
programs can be compiled into machine-independent byte code files,
which contain encodings of WAM instructions and are interpreted by
the simulator. Among SB-Prolog's features are dynamic
loading of predicates, an extension table facility that permits
memoization of relations, macro definition/expansion, and tail
recursion optimizations.

********************************************************************
*** NOTE: SB-Prolog is superseded by XSB and hence is no longer  ***
*** supported by Stony Brook or the University of Arizona. The   ***
*** only reason to continue using SB-Prolog is for DOS, since    ***
*** XSB does not run under DOS and there are currently no plans  ***
*** to port it to DOS. XSB is more robust than SB-Prolog and     ***
*** XSB's compiler is quite a bit faster. XSB also supports      ***
*** tabling (OLDT evaluation) at the engine level, which lets    ***
*** you write programs that are much cleaner, shorter, & faster. ***
********************************************************************

There are three main versions: 2.5, 3.0, and 3.1. Version 2.5 runs
on machines like Vax, Sun3, HP-9000, and Amiga, but not on alignment
restricted processors like Sun4, Pyramid-98x, DEC3100 and SGI Iris.
Versions 3.0 and 3.1 do run on alignment-restricted systems, but lack
some builtin predicates. There were many different copies of the
different versions floating about; we've tried to resolve the
differences as best as possible. (Some of the differences had to do
with garbage collection, which was apparently buggy.) 

All the versions contain a couple of benchmarks, such as naive
reverse and Pereira's benchmark suite, and some documentation.
Other documentation is also available in the doc.tar file.

The msdos subdirectory contains the 386 MS-DOS port of SB-Prolog
version 3.1.01 (31-OCT-91).  It was compiled using version 1.05 of the
386 MS-DOS GNU C compiler port by D. J. Delorie.  It supports up to
128M of extended memory and 128M of disk space for swapping.  It is
compatible with XMS and VCPI programs (such as QEMM and 386MAX), but
not DPMI (such as Windows 3.0).

The Amiga port is in the amiga directory and includes a hypertext
version of the SB-Prolog manual for version 2.5 of the language.

The hilog directory contains a prototype of SB-HiLog that runs
under Quintus Prolog and SB-Prolog. SB-HiLog is an extension of
Prolog that possesses a higher-order syntax, so that arbitrary
terms may occupy the function position of terms. (XSB also includes
a version of HiLog.)
