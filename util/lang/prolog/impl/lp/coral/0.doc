Name:         CORAL

Summary:      Deductive database/logic programming language.

Version:      1.1 (2-FEB-94)

Description: 

   CORAL is a deductive database/logic programming system developed at
   the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is a declarative language
   based on Horn-clause rules with extensions like SQL's group-by and
   aggregation operators, and uses a Prolog-like syntax.

   CORAL supports many evaluation techniques, including bottom-up
   fixpoint evaluation and top-down backtracking, a module mechanism,
   support for disk-resident data, a C++ interface, and an on-line help
   facility.

Requires:     AT&T c++ or GNU g++
