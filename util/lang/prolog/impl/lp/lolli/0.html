<H2>Lolli: An interpreter for linear logic programming.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/prolog/impl/lp/lolli/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
Lolli is an interpreter for logic programming based on intuitionist
linear logic principles. Lolli, named for the linear logic implication
operator "-o" called lollipop, is a full implementation of the
language described in the Hodas & Miller paper "Logic Programming in a
Fragment of Intuitionistic Linear Logic", though it differs a bit in
syntax, and has several built-in extra-logical predicates and
operators.

The logic underlying Lolli can be viewed as a refinement of the the
Hereditary Harrop formulas of Lambda-Prolog.  All the operators
(though not the higher order unification) of Lambda-Prolog are
supported, but with the addition of linear variations.  Thus a Lolli
program distinguishes between clauses that can be used as many, or as
few, times as desired, and those that must be used exactly once.

These features have been used to provide a perspicuous, logical
implementation of a number of example problems, including
object-oriented programming with mutable state and information hiding,
database update, and term rewriting.  Lolli has also been used as the
setting for the development of a filler-gap dependency parser for
natural language processing (see Hodas's JICSLP-92 paper).

The preliminary implementation of Lolli is based on code written by
Pfenning and Elliot for their paper "A Semi-Functional Implementation
of a Higher-Order Logic Programming Language".

The system is written in Standard ML of New Jersey, and the parser and
lexer were built using the parser-generator (MLYACC) and
lexical-analyzer-generator (MLLEX) distributed with that system.
Though source files for the parser and lexer have been included, the
parser and lexer have already been built, so you do not need access to
the MLYACC or MLLEX.
