Description: 

   Johan Bevemyr's Luther-based WAM-tracer is available by anonymous ftp
   from Uppsala University in Sweden. It includes a simple compiler from
   Prolog to WAM code and a low-level WAM code tracer written in
   emacs-lisp.  The tracer splits the screen into regions to show
   data-areas, registers, and so on. You can then step through running
   the code.
