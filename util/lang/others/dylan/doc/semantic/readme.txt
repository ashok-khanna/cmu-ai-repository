Subject: Denotational Semantics of Dylan?
Newsgroup: comp.lang.dylan

Hello,

My partner and I finished our paper on Dylan.  Based on the responses I
received and our limited time, we backed off from doing a complete
denotational semantics and instead tried to describe how Dylan works on top
of Scheme.

Thanks to all of you who responded via email and in the group.  Your input
was very useful to us.

The final paper is available for anonymous FTP on ted.cs.uidaho.edu in
pub/sml.  There is a compressed postscript file as well as a compressed
DVI.

Thanks again for all of your help.
Kelly
