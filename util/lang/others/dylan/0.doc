Name:         Dylan

Summary:      Apple's new Object-Oriented Dynamic Language.

Description:

   Dylan is a new Object-Oriented Dynamic Language (OODL), based on
   Scheme, CLOS, and Smalltalk. The purpose of the language is to retain
   the benefits of OODLs and also allow efficient application delivery.
   The design stressed keeping Dylan small and consistent, while
   allowing a high degree of expressiveness. Dylan is consistently
   object-oriented; it is not a procedural language with an
   object-oriented extension.
   
   A manual/specification for the language is available from Apple
   Computer.  Send email to dylan-manual-request@cambridge.apple.com or
   write to Apple Computer, 1 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142.  Include
   your complete address and also a phone number (the phone number is
   especially important for anyone outside the US).
   
   Apple hasn't announced plans to release Dylan as a product.
