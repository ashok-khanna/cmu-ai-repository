README
======
Marlais is a simple-minded interpreter for a program language strongly
resembling Dylan [1].  It is not intended as a final release, but
rather to fill a perceived void where Dylan implementations are
concerned.  This is a "hackers release" and is intended as a vehicle
for education, experimentation and also to encourage people to port it
to different architectures, add features, and fix bugs.  Marlais is
alpha software and should not be used by people desiring
reliability!!!

See INSTALL for information on installing Marlais.

See MACHINES for a list of supported machines.

See PORTING for information on porting Marlais to another
architecture. 

See BUGS for information on how to report bugs.

See DIFFERENCES for information on some of the differences between
Marlais and Dylan.

See HACKING for information on adding to and fixing Marlais.

See ADDED for information on new features in this release.
