Package:      lang/others/dylan/impl/marlais/

Name:         Marlais

Summary:      Interpreter for a Dylan-like language.

Version:      0.4 (13-JUL-94)

Description: 

   Marlais is a simple interpreter for a language strongly resembling
   Dylan. It is not intended as a final release, but rather
   to fill a perceived void where Dylan implementations are concerned.
   This is a "hackers release" and is intended as a vehicle for
   education, experimentation and also to encourage people to port it to
   different architectures, add features, and fix bugs.  Marlais is alpha
   software and should not be used by people desiring reliability!!!
