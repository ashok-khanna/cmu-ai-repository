Subject: Patches for Thomas to run under SunOS 4.1

Here follows the patches I've used to compile Thomas-1.1 under SunOS
4.1.2. It's basically the MCC02 patches from gatekeeper.dec.com
applied to the scc-files that thomas uses plus some small manual
changes.

They are also ftp-able from ftp.stacken.kth.se:pub/thomas.
