Name:         Mindy

Summary:      Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet 

Version:      1.0 (30-JUN-94)

Description: 

   Mindy (Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet) is a Dylan-like language. Mindy is
   incomplete, in that it does not implement everything in the Dylan
   Interim Reference Manual (DIRM) and the DIRM itself is yet
   incomplete. But Mindy does implement most of what the authors feel
   Dylan will be.

   Mindy was developed by the Gwydion Project at Carnegie Mellon
   University for internal use as a development tool while work on the
   "real" high-performance Dylan implementation progresses. Mindy has
   been made available as a courtesy to people who want to learn about Dylan.
   However, the amount of effort that will be put into maintaining Mindy
   is strictly limited, since Mindy isn't intended to be an industrial
   strength implementation.

Requires:     Gcc, Gmake, Flex, Bison

Ports:        Tested on DECstation (MACH), HP 700 (HP-UX). Also has
              been built on DEC Alpha (OSF1) and SGI (Irix) but not
              tested extensively.
