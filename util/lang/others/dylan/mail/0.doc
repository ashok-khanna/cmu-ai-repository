              The INFO-DYLAN mailing list is for any and all discussions
              of Dylan, including language design issues, implementation
              issues, marketing issues, syntax issues, etc.

              The ANNOUNCE-DYLAN mailing list is for major announcements
              about Dylan, such as the availability of new
              implementations, new versions of the manual, etc.  This
              mailing list should be *MUCH* lower volume than INFO-DYLAN.
              Everything sent to this list is also sent to INFO-DYLAN.

              TO SUBSCRIBE: Send mail to the -request version of the list
              to be added to it.  You can also send an email message to
              majordomo@cambridge.apple.com with "subscribe info-dylan" or
              "unsubscribe info-dylan" in the body, and likewise for the
              other lists, mutatis mutandis.
