Name:         FEEL

Summary:      Initial implementation of the EuLisp language.

Version:      Feel 0.90 (23-NOV-93); Defn 0.99 (31-JUL-93);
              Comp 0.89 (31-JUL-93)

Description: 
   
   Feel (Free and Eventually Eulisp) is an initial implementation of the
   EuLisp language from the University of Bath, UK.  EuLisp is sort of
   like an extended Scheme. It includes an integrated object system, a
   module system, and support for parallelism. Feel is partly a C-based
   interpreter and partly a bytecode interpreter/compiler.  An
   out-of-core compiler system is also available.  The distribution
   includes an interface to the PVM library, support for TCP/IP sockets,
   and libraries for futures, Linda, and CSP.

   This directory contains the EuLisp language definition, the Feel
   implementation, and implementations of the EuLisp object system
   in Common Lisp (Telos) and Scheme (Telosis).

Requires:     

Ports:        Feel is known to run on Sun3, Sun4, Stardent Titan, KSR-1,
              Alliant Concentrix 2800, Orion clippers, DEC VAX, HP 730,
              DECstation 3000, Gould UTX/32, and Inmos T800 transputer
              (using CS-Tools). (All bar the last four have a threads
              mechanism.) It can run in multi-process mode on the
              first three machines, and hopefully any other SysV-like
              machine with shared memory primitives. Porting Feel to
              new machines is reasonably straightforward. It now also
              runs on MS-DOS machines.
