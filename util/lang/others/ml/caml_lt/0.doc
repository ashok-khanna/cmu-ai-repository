Summary:      Small, portable implementation of the ML language

Version:      0.6 (1-SEP-93)

Description: 

  Caml Light is a small, portable implementation of the ML language.

  Caml Light implements the Caml language, a functional language from
  the ML family. Caml is quite close to Standard ML, though not strictly
  conformant. There are some slight differences in syntax and semantics,
  and major differences in the module system (these changes were
  required to support separate compilation).

  Caml Light is implemented as a bytecode compiler, and fully
  bootstraped.  The runtime system and bytecode interpreter is written
  in standard C, hence Caml Light is easy to port to almost any 32-bit
  platform. The whole system is quite small: about 100K for the runtime
  system, and another 100K of bytecode for the compiler. 1.2 megabyte of
  memory is enough to recompile the whole system. This stands in sharp
  contrast with other implementations of ML, such as SML-NJ, that
  requires about ten times more memory. Performance is quite good for a
  bytecoded implementation: five to ten times slower than SML-NJ.

  Caml Light comes in two flavors: a classical, interactive, toplevel-based
  system; and a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone
  programs, in the spirit of the Unix cc compiler. The former is good for
  learning the language and testing programs. The latter integrates more
  smoothly within programming environments. The generated programs are quite
  small, and can be used like any other command.
