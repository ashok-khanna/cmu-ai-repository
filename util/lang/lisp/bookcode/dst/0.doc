Summary:      Code from David S. Touretzky's book

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains source code from 
      David S. Touretzky
      "Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation"
      Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Redwood City, CA, 1990. 592 pages.
      ISBN 0-8053-0492-4. 

   Touretzky's book is perhaps the best tutorial introduction to the
   language. It has clear and correct explanations, and covers some
   fairly advanced topics. The book is an updated Common Lisp version of
   the 1984 edition published by Harper and Row Publishers.

   Three free Lisp educational tools which were used in the book --
   Evaltrace, DTRACE and SDRAW -- are available in the lisp/ and
   evaltrace/ subdirectories.  Evaltrace is agraphical notation for
   explaining how evaluation works and is described in "Visualizing
   Evaluation in Applicative Languages" by David S. Touretzky and Peter
   Lee, CACM 45-59, October 1992.  DTRACE is a "detailed trace" which
   provides more information than the tracing tools provided with most
   Common Lisp implementations. SDRAW is a read-eval-draw loop that
   evaluates Lisp expressions and draws the result as a cons cell diagram
   (for both X11 and ascii terminals). Also available is PPMX, a tool for
   pretty printing macro expansions.
