Summary:      Common Lisp regression tester

Version:      19-DEC-90

Description: 

   Everyone knows that it is important to test a system thoroughly
   whenever it is changed.  However, it is far from easy to come up with
   good tests and irritatingly laborious to keep track of a lot of tests
   and run them time and again.  The RT Common Lisp regression tester
   automates part of this task.

   Using RT, the programmer still has to come up with tests.  However, RT
   maintains a database of these tests and automatically runs them when
   requested.  This can take a lot of computer time, but does not take
   any of the programmer's time.  As a result, any bugs found by running
   the tests---and this is a lot more bugs than you might think---are
   essentially found for free.
