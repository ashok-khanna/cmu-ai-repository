Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/plisp/

Name:         PLISP

Summary:      Lisp-to-PostScript compiler.

Version:      1987

Description: 

   PostScript is a programming language for the description of images on
   a printed page.  Many laser printers now use PostScript.  A very rich
   set of graphic operations which allow complex images to be described
   in a simple and concise manner are provided by the PostScript
   language.

   While many systems, such as Tex, pic, or MacDraw, generate PostScript
   code, none of these allow the user access to the full power of the
   PostScript language.  However, programming directly in PostScript can
   be difficult.  Both the syntax and semantics of the language are
   oriented more toward simplicity of execution rather than ease of
   programming.  The purpose of this compiler is to take the basic
   structure of Common Lisp and use it as an alternative representation
   of a PostScript program.  While the basic graphic operators of
   PostScript are retained, Lisp-like function definition, control flow,
   and variable binding become available.  Macros, defined constants, and
   function libraries have also been provided.  The PLisp compiler
   generates PostScript code which is guaranteed not to contain errors in
   stack usage.

Requires:     

Ports:        Lucid CL. Should work fine in any valid Common Lisp.
