Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/tl/

Name:         TL

Summary:      Support for Top-Level interaction loops in Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   This package implements a few general purpose support routines for "top
   level" interaction in Lisp. The function Top-Level implements a lisp
   listener and command interpreter similar in behavior to the alias
   command feature in Franz or the command prompt in Symbolics'
   Genera. Top-level is completely generic. You create your own
   interpreters or applications by defining new command tables. A sample
   application called TL is provided that implements an interpreter that
   supports a few commands for general lisp interaction, such as Package,
   Cload, Macroexpand etc. The function Ask-User is a general purpose
   user-query facility.  The function Edit-Object supports interactive
   clos object editing by dynamically defining a command table appropriate
   to the object and invoking a Top-Level loop to implement editing
   commands.  

   TL is part of the Common Music (CM) music composition language, but is
   generic enough and portable enough to be of use in other applications.
   CM itself is available by anonymous ftp from ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu
   [36.49.0.93] and ftp.zkm.de [192.101.28.17] in the files pub/cm.tar.Z.
