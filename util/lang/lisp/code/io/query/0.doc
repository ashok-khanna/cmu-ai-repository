Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/query/

Name:         QUERY

Summary:      Lisp code for querying the user.

Version:      

Description: 

   The QUERY package generalizes the capabilities of the Lisp
   functions Y-OR-N-P and YES-OR-NO-P, and is similar in many ways to
   the Symbolics FQUERY function. There are several major differences,
   one of which is QUERY's ability to timeout with a default value. In
   addition to redefining Y-OR-N-P and YES-OR-NO-P in terms of QUERY,
   this package defines Y-OR-N-P-WAIT and YES-OR-NO-P-WAIT to illustrate
   the timeout capability. More complicated queries are possible using
   the QUERY function.
