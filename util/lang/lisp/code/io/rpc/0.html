<H2>RPC: Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/code/io/rpc/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC that currently runs only in
Xerox Common Lisp, but was written with portability in mind. It has
been the basis of many robust clients (including NFS) but includes
little support for the implementation of network services.  The code
was originally written by Jeff Finger while at Stanford, and has been
subsequently revised at Xerox by Bill van Melle.

The authors hope that someone will be enticed to: 
   (1) port the code other Common Lisp implementations; and further
   (2) extend the system to support implementation of servers
Both of these are significant programming efforts, requiring
familiarity with both SUN RPC and the foreign function interface of
the target Lisp.  The first task also requires some familiarity with
Interlisp-D.
