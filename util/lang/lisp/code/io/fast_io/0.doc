Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/fast_io/

Name:         Fast_IO

Summary:      Code and discussion of fast file IO in Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   A common complaint about Lisp implementations is that the file I/O
   is slow. Although the Lisp standard does not provide primitives for
   reading and writing blocks of data, it is possible to do this in most
   Lisp implementations. This package gives an example of how to do this.
   When data is read and written in this manner, the speed of file i/o
   approaches that of C programs.
