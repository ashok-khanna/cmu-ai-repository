Summary:      Lisp code for benchmarking, research, education, and fun

Description:

   This directory contains a variety of Lisp code and algorithm
   implementations. This collection is intended to facilitate
   code reuse. The code included here is of a type more basic to
   programming in Lisp. AI software systems that happen to be
   implemented in Lisp will appear in the areas/ directory tree.
