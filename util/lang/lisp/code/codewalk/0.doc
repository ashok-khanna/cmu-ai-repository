Name:         Codewalking

Summary:      Lisp code that grovels over arbitrary Lisp code

Description:

   Since the underlying syntax of Lisp programs and data is the same,
   it is possible to write Lisp programs that walk down the structure
   of a program. These programs provide just such a facility.
