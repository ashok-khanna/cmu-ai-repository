Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/clasp/

Name:         CLASP and CLIP

Summary:      Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package

Version:      CLASP 1.3.2 (4-FEB-94); CLIP 1.4 (4-FEB-94)
              
Description: 

   CLASP (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package) provides the basic
   functionality of a statistics package. The CLIM interface includes a
   "notebook" that is both a "desktop" for icons and a Lisp interactor
   pane, and uses BBN's SciGraph package for plotting.  The Common Lisp
   Instrumentation Package (CLIP) is available along with CLASP.  CLIP is
   designed to allow AI system developers and evaluators a portable way to
   define and manage "alligator clips" for instrumenting their programs.
   CLIP produces data about program behavior in CLASP format, as well as
   other commonly used data formats.  It currently has facilities to
   support experiment design, such as scenario scripting and factorial
   combination of independent variables, and can collect data in
   summary form (at the end of each trial) or based upon the occurrence of
   specific events (both periodic and non-periodic).

   Using CLIP/CLASP the experimenter can:

      - collect and filter data while a program runs 

      - define and automatically run experiments to evaluate a program's
        behavior in different conditions

      - transform, filter and partition data in powerful ways

      - examine data graphically and statistically 

      - run parametric and computer-intensive tests
