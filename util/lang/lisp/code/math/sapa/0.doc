Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/sapa/

Name:         SAPA

Summary:      Library of Lisp functions for spectral analysis and statistics

Version:      1.0 (21-JUL-93)

Description: 

   Sapaclisp is a collection of Common Lisp functions that can be used to
   carry out many of the computations described in the SAPA book

      Donald B. Percival and Andrew T. Walden, "Spectral Analysis for
      Physical Applications: Multitaper and Conventional Univariate
      Techniques", Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 1993.

   The SAPA book uses a number of time series as examples
   of various spectral analysis techniques.  The most important of
   these series are also available from StatLib by sending the command
      send sapa from datasets
   to the Internet address
      statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu

   Sapaclisp features functions for converting to/from decibels, the
   Fortran sign function, log of the gamma function, manipulating
   polynomials, root finding, simple numerical integration, matrix
   functions, Cholesky and modified Gram-Schmidt (i.e., Q-R) matrix
   decompositions, sample means and variances, sample medians,
   computation of quantiles from various distributions, linear least
   squares, discrete Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform, chirp
   transform, low-pass filters, high-pass filters, band-pass filters,
   sample autocovariance sequence, autoregressive spectral estimates,
   least squares, forward/backward least squares, Burg's algorithm, the
   Yule-Walker method, periodogram, direct spectral estimates, lag window
   spectral estimates, WOSA spectral estimates, sample cepstrum, time
   series bandwidth, cumulative periodogram test statistic for white
   noise, and Fisher's g statistic.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Tested in MCL, Symbolics Genera 8.1.1, and Allegro CL.
