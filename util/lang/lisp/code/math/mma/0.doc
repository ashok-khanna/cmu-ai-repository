Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/mma/

Name:         MockMma

Summary:      Mathematica-style parser written in Common Lisp. 

Version:      1.5, 19 Nov 1992

Description: 

   This program is a rough shell that has only rudimentary (but fast)
   parsing, display, numeric evaluation, polynomial/rational
   simplification, integration, and some pattern matching.  It is not a
   substitute for Mathematica (r), Maple (r), etc., and is not intended
   to compete with such commercial systems.  This system can be used for
   experimentation, such as inserting an entirely different evaluation
   strategy or an entirely different numeric system, and re-run your
   "Mathematica(r) source code" through it.  Or hook it up to your
   favorite other semantics for solve, integrate, and so on (e.g. JACAL,
   Reduce, Macsyma, Maple, ...).

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs in any valid Common Lisp. Tested in Allegro, KCL and Lucid.
