Name:         QUINE

Summary:      Quine Tree algorithm for satisfiability

Version:      1-DEC-92

Description: 

   A satisfiability program implemented in Common Lisp. It is supposed
   to work on any boolean expression, but was mainly designed for 3sat.
   If you use a propositional inference engine in your work, this
   program is probably faster in a majority of cases.

   On Mitchell, Selman, Levesque hard spot problems, the program takes
   from 1 minute to 15 minutes on 150 variable instances, including
   unsatisfiable instances, averaging under 10 minutes.  The program
   appears to run in time N*2^(N/22) on MSL hard spot instances.

              If you do anything with the program, Dan would be
              interested in receiving a quick summary.  Also, if you 
              let him know that you are using it, he may be able to
              send you patches, upgrades, etc.
