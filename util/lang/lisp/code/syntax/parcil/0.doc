Name:         PARCIL

Summary:      A Parser for C syntax In Lisp

Version:      0.1a

Description: 

   PARCIL is a parser for a subset of the syntax for the C programming
   language.  PARCIL is written in Common Lisp, making it potentially
   a useful building block for user interfaces for people who do not
   like prefix syntax.

   PARCIL is a recursive descent parser optimized to parse C.  This makes it
   fairly brittle and difficult to modify.  However, it does make it fairly
   fast, and it also allows the parser to deal with lots of C idiosyncrasies
   which are difficult to implement in general-purpose parsers, such as
   operator precedence and prefix and postfix operators. It can also
   parse floating point numbers.

   NOTE: PARCIL is incomplete, providing no support for high-level C
   constructs, and does very little error checking.
