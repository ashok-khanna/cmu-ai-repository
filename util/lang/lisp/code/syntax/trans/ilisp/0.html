<H2>LTRAN: Code for translating Interlisp to Common Lisp.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/code/syntax/trans/ilisp/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
This package translates Lisp programs written in Interlisp to several
other dialects of Lisp.  This package was originally written in
Interlisp by Gordon Novak, and was ported to Common Lisp by
itself with some help from Peter Karp.  This package should only be
considered an AID to the process of porting a program from Interlisp
to another dialect.  The package will perform approximately 95% of the
translation process, but it is very likely to miss certain constructs
in the translation process, which must be translated by hand.  Use
this package at your own risk; its performance is not warrantied in
any way.  

Note that there are two versions of this translator: an Interlisp
version and a Common Lisp version.  The Interlisp version is a single
standalone file; the Common Lisp version includes a shell script that
uses several Unix utilities to preprocess the Interlisp source file,
plus a Common Lisp program that does the higher-level translation.
