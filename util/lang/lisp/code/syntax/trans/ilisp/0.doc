Name:         LTRAN

Summary:      Code for translating Interlisp to Common Lisp.

Version:      9-JAN-92

Description: 

   This package translates Lisp programs written in Interlisp to several
   other dialects of Lisp.  This package was originally written in
   Interlisp by Gordon Novak, and was ported to Common Lisp by
   itself with some help from Peter Karp.  This package should only be
   considered an AID to the process of porting a program from Interlisp
   to another dialect.  The package will perform approximately 95% of the
   translation process, but it is very likely to miss certain constructs
   in the translation process, which must be translated by hand.  Use
   this package at your own risk; its performance is not warrantied in
   any way.  

   Note that there are two versions of this translator: an Interlisp
   version and a Common Lisp version.  The Interlisp version is a single
   standalone file; the Common Lisp version includes a shell script that
   uses several Unix utilities to preprocess the Interlisp source file,
   plus a Common Lisp program that does the higher-level translation.
