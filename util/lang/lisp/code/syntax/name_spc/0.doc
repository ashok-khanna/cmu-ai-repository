Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/name_spc/

Name:         One Name Space (ONS)

Summary:      Provides for a single Lisp name space for functions and variables

Version:      

Description: 

   ONS (One Name Space) provides a buggy reader macro for providing a
   single Lisp syntax for functions and variables. It bypasses the
   function-bindings of symbols and uses the value-bindings for everything.
   ONS also provides for currying function-calls automatically.

   The user of this module writes code that looks like this:

      [if [> x y]
        [print x]
        [print y]]

   and the bracket readmacro converts it into this:

      (if (funcall > x y)
        (funcall print x)
        (funcall print y))
