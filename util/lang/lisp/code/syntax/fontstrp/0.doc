Name:         Font Stripper

Summary:      Strips Symbolics font information from a text file.

Version:      7/24/87

Description: 

   This program will strip Symbolics font information from a text file.
   The syntax is "font-stripper filename" or "font-stripper in-filename
   out-filename".  If only a single filename is given, then the
   font-stripper replaces the source file with the font stripped output.
   With two filenames, the output file gets the font-stripped output.

   Warning: The program doesn't correctly deal with the case where
   in-filename is the same as out-filename.
