<H2>INFIX: Infix reader macro for Common Lisp.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
This is an implementation of an infix reader macro.  It allows the
user to type arithmetic expressions in the traditional way (e.g., 1+2)
when writing Lisp programs instead of using the normal Lisp syntax
(e.g., (+ 1 2)).  It is not intended to be a full replacement for the
normal Lisp syntax. If you want a more complete alternate syntax for
Lisp, get a copy Apple's MLisp or Pratt's CGOL.

Although similar in concept to the Symbolics infix reader (#<DIAMOND>),
no real effort has been made to ensure compatibility beyond coverage
of at least the same set of basic arithmetic operators. There are several
differences in the syntax beyond just the choice of #I as the macro
character. (Our syntax is a little bit more C-like than the Symbolics
macro in addition to some more subtle differences.)

We initially chose $ as a macro character because of its association
with mathematics in LaTeX, but unfortunately that character is already
used in MCL. We switched to #I() because it was one of the few options
remaining.

Documentation included at the top of the source file. Examples and
testing routines at the end.
