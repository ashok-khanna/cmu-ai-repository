Summary:      Acuff's Lisp Benchmarking Suite

Version:      

Description: 

   Source code for the benchmark programs used to gather data for 
      Richard Acuff, "Performance of Two Common Lisp Programs on
      Several Systems", Stanford University Knowledge Systems Lab
      (KSL) Report 89-02, 1989.
   Includes copies of the tech report in LaTeX and Microsoft Word
   formats. The TR contains information about running the tests. 

   Acuff benchmarks 10 Common Lisp implementations on a variety of
   hardware platforms using two moderate-sized application programs,
   BB1 1.2 and SOAR 4.4.4. Neither of these programs makes intensive
   use of numeric computation. He also considers the effects of
   compiler optimization levels and the impact of display I/O on run time.

   The lisp implementations tested include Lucid, Franz Allegro CL,
   MACL, AKCL, KCL, VaxLisp, TI Explorers, Symbolics MacIvory, 
   Symbolics 3650, and Xerox 1186.

   The results suggest that the performance of Lisp systems is very
   mcuh application dependent.
