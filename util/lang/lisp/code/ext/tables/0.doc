Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/tables/

Name:         DEFTABLE

Summary:      Unifies interface to Common Lisp's table-like data structures.

Version:      1992

Description: 

   The DEFTABLE macro unifies the interface to Common Lisp's table-like
   data structures (e.g., association lists, property lists, and hash
   tables, vectors), providing a concise, lightweight syntax. Later, when
   it's time to tune the performance of your program, you can specify how
   each table type will be implemented. For the purpose of this program,
   a table is anything you can put key/value pairs into and subsequently
   retrieve the value using the key.
