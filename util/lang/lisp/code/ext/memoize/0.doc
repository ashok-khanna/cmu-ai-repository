Summary:      The Automatic Memoization Facility

Version:      1.0

Description: 

   The Automatic Memoization Facility adds a practical memoization
   facility to Common Lisp. Automatic memoization is a technique by which
   an existing function can be transformed into one that "remembers"
   previous arguments and their associated results, yielding large
   performance gains for certain types of applications.  This facility
   extends the ideas from Norvig's book into what is needed for a
   practical tool for us in large programs. It adds facilities for
   bookkeeping and timing, and lets you evaluate of the timing advantages
   of memoization, and save hash tables to disk for automatic reuse in
   later sessions. 

   The code includes an overview of memoization and its applications,
   and a PostScript version of a paper on the subject that appeared in
   the Sixth International Symposium on AI, Monterrey Mexico,
   September 1993.
