<H2>SCREAMER: Adds backtracking and constraint satisfaction to 
              Common Lisp.</H2>

Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the
Screamer-to-Common-Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise,
only small portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking
primitives, Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers
for languages in which backtracking is more pervasive.

The Screamer user-contributed code includes a pedagogical
implementation of the SNLP planning algorithm in Screamer and code to
add a layer on top of Screamer to permit the retraction of assertions.
