Summary:      Adds backtracking and constraint satisfaction to Common Lisp.

Version:      3.12

Description: 

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the
   Screamer-to-Common-Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise,
   only small portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking
   primitives, Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers
   for languages in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   The Screamer user-contributed code includes a pedagogical
   implementation of the SNLP planning algorithm in Screamer and code to
   add a layer on top of Screamer to permit the retraction of assertions.

Requires:     

Ports:        Symbolics (Genera 8.1.1, 8.3)
              Lucid CL 4.0.2, 4.1 (Sun SPARC), 4.1 (SGI MIPS), 4.0.1
                 (IBM RS/6000)
              MCL 2.0, 2.0p2
              Harlequin 3.0.3+ (Sun SPARC)

              It should run under any implementation of Common Lisp which is
              compliant with CLtL2 and with minor revision could be made to 
              run under implementations compliant with CLtL1 or dpANS.
