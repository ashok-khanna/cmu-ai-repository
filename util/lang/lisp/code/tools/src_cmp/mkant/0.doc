Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/src_cmp/mkant/

Name:         Source Compare (SC)

Summary:      A 'diff' program for Common Lisp

Version:      24-JAN-91

Description: 

   Source Compare is a portable tool for comparing Common Lisp source
   files, similar to the UNIX program 'diff'. Like diff it can ignore
   case, whitespace, and blank lines. In addition, it can also ignore
   certain classes of Lisp comments. It uses a greedy algorithm that runs
   in average-case O(m+n) time.

Requires:     Common Lisp

Ports:        Fully portable. Tested in CMU CL, Allegro CL, MCL, Lucid CL.
