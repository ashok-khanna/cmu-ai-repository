Summary:      InterLisp Source Comparison Tool

Version:      15-APR-88

Description: 

   COMPARESOURCES is an Interlisp program for comparing two versions of a Lisp
   source file for differences.  The comparison is completely
   brute-force: COMPARESOURCES reads the complete contents of both files,
   and compares all the expressions for differences.  

   Note that this code is very much dependent on Interlisp, since it uses
   the DWIMIFY function for cleaning up the functions before comparison.
   On the other hand, it does provide a Lispish form-by-form comparison
   that avoids differences in indentation. So it might be useful to
   port this code to Common Lisp someday. In its current form, it really
   isn't usable.
