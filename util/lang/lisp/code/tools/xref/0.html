XREF is a portable static analysis cross referencing tool for Common
Lisp. It determines the callers of functions and variables and is
useful for mapping out the structure of a program. XREF is similar to
the Symbolics Who-Calls and Xerox Masterscope programs. It includes an
interface to Joe Bates' PostScript graphing tool (psgraph.lisp).

When you change a function or variable definition, it can be useful to
know its callers, in order to update each of them to the new
definition. Similarly, having a graphic display of the structure
(e.g., call graph) of a program can help make undocumented code more
understandable. This static code analyzer facilitates both
capabilities.  The database compiled by xref is suitable for viewing
by a graphical browser. (Note: the reference graph is not necessarily
a DAG. Since many graphical browsers assume a DAG, this will lead to
infinite loops.  Some code which is useful in working around this
problem is included, as well as a sample text-indenting outliner and
an interface to Bates' PSGraph PostScript Graphing facility.)
