Name:         CMU LOOP 

Summary:      CMU Implementation of ANSI Loop Macro

Version:      1.8 5/24/91 19:37:33 wlott, with bug fixes by mkant

Description: 

   CMU CLtL2-compatible Loop Macro. Please note that it uses the
   WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR feature added by X3J13, which may not be
   available in all "CLtL2-compatible" lisps.  Also, since the macro was
   implemented from scratch, it adheres to the (rather vague) word of the
   specification, but not necessarily to historical precedent (e.g., loop
   variables are not bound in FINALLY clauses, etc.).

   Some bug fixes and portability enhancements by mkant, but still
   slightly buggy. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Easily ported to any valid Common Lisp. Runs in Lucid,
              Allegro, AKCL, and CMU Common Lisp, of course.

Origin:       Part of CMU Common Lisp.

Copying:      Public domain.

Updated:      

CD-ROM:       Prime Time Freeware for AI, Issue 1-1
