Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/sloop/

Name:         SLOOP

Summary:      William Schelter's SLOOP iteration facility.

Version:      

Description: 

   SLOOP is a Common Lisp portable iteration facility written by William
   Schelter.  SLOOP is extremely user extensible, allowing one to easily
   redefine the behavior and add additional collections and iteration
   paths. There is a significant amount of backwards compatibility with
   the original MIT loop macro.

   The file includes several examples of extensions, such as
      .. FOR v IN-FRINGE x ..         (iterate through the fringe of a tree x)
      .. SUM v ..                     (add the v)
      .. AVERAGING v ..      
      .. FOR sym IN-PACKAGE y         (iterate through symbols in a package y)
      .. COLLATE v ..                 (for collecting X into an ordered list),
      .. FOR (elt i) IN-ARRAY ar      (iterate through array ar, with index i)
      .. FOR (key elt) IN-TABLE foo.. (if foo is a hash table)

              The behavior of the SLOOP macro may be changed after
              loading by resetting some of the global variables near
              the beginning of the file. But changes to the file
              itself are prohibited.
