<H2>MIT LOOP: The original MIT Loop macro implementation.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/mit/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
This is a copy of the "officially sanctioned" MIT LOOP macro for
running in Common Lisp. There are several differences between this
LOOP macro and the macro incorporated into the ANSI Common Lisp
specification. Some small changes have been made to the file to bring
it closer to the specification, but for better conformance, see the
Symbolics 1991 update. The original unaltered file is in the original/
directory.

The LOOP Iteration Macro is a conversion of LOOP 829, which is fairly
close to that released with Symbolics Release 6.1 (803).  This
conversion was made by Glenn Burke (one of the original author/maintainers);
the work was performed at Palladian Software, in Cambridge MA, April 1986.

              Fixes and changes should be limited, as this version is
              supposed to be compatible with the Maclisp/Zetalisp/NIL
              LOOP. It is NOT intended to be "different" or "better"
              or "redesigned".

   It is Technical Memo 169, "LOOP Iteration Macro", and is very old.  The
   most up-to-date documentation on this version of LOOP is that in the NIL
   Reference Manual (TR-311 from LCS Publications);  while you wouldn't
   want to get that (it costs nearly $15) just for LOOP documentation,
   those with access to a NIL manual might photocopy the chapter on LOOP.
