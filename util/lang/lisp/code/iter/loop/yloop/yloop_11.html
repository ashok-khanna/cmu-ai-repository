;;; CHANGES
;;; Version 1.1 released.
;;; Tidied up test code, comments cleaned up a bit, provide yloop as feature
;;;   and package, added version number, fixed ldo to be safer, included
;;;   hints from Jeni Tennison.  5-16-94 -FER
;;; fixed restrictive for i from x to y where x and y were required to be
;;;   numebrs at load time -fr 2/5/88
;;; made all clause keywords local to yloop package, and updated documentation
;;;    to reflect this fact.  -fr 10/27/86
;;; end tests also checked in the beginning to catch the case of no iteration
;;;     needed -fr 10/08/86
;;; note that I optimized the code in lfor so that it didn't eval its arg's 
;;;    twice -fr 7/19/86
;;; multiple end tests accomidated by use of or on end-tests
;;;   -fr 9/10/86
;;; Code originially in  conger:>jim>yale-loop>yale-loop.lisp.

;;;
;;; Yale loop macro written in Common Lisp based on the loop construct in 
;;; McDermont, Charniak and Riesbeck's AI programming book.
;;;
;;; DESIGN APPROACH
;;; Each loop statement such as before or while are macros themselves. Given
;;; their arguments they fill out a template of what should be stored in
;;; appropriate positions in the loop. The loop macro then fetches the
;;; collection of all templates and pieces them together the loop code (all 
;;; templates stored in the global *loop-alist*). The advantage of this 
;;; approach is that the syntax of the loop is order independent.
;;
;;; LOCAL LOOP VARIABLES
;;;
;;; Use INITIAL to define variables within the scope of the loop.
;;; E.g. (initial (foo 5) (bar 'baz)). This will be translated in 
;;; (let* ( (foo 5) (bar 'baz) ..) ..). Notice that 
;;; bindings are done sequentially via let*
;;;
;;; ITERATION DRIVING CLAUSES
;;;
;;; The iteration driving clauses are those discussed the sections of
;;; numeric iteration
;;; mapping of lists and the macros WHILE and UNTIL.  (WHILE x) and (UNTIL y)
;;; are translated to expand into (if (not x) nil (go loop)) and (if y nil 
;;; (go loop))
;;; 
;;; NUMERIC ITERATION
;;; There are 2 ways to perform numeric iteration. The first is via the FOR 
;;; statement:
;;; e.g. (FOR iteration-variable FROM begin-iteration TO  end-iteration STEP
;;;  inc-or-dec) [downward stepping can be implemented using negative steps]
;;; The second is via the (incr ..) and (decr ..) constructs. FROM and IN are 
;;; synonyms in this construct. If the .IN. type construct is desired 
;;; (see documentation), use IN not FROM. A step value is optional in both
;;; cases and defaults to 1.
;;;
;;; MAPPING OF LISTS
;;; Two constructs are provided for list mapping both accessible via the FOR
;;; statement. The IN construct permits mapping over successive elements of 
;;; the list. Eg. (for a in '(1 2 3 4))
;;; The ON constuct is similar to in except that it maps over successive cdrs.
;;;
;;; Examples 
;;;
;;; (yloop (incr a .in. 0 to 10) (ldo (print a))) ;print 0..10
;;; (yloop (ldo (print 'a)))
;;; 
;;; (yloop(initially a 0 b 5)(for x from 0 to 10)(ldo(print x))(result b))
;;;    will print 0..10 and return 5.
;;;
;;; 
;;;
;;; ADDING NEW LOOP MACROS
;;;
;;; Code has been provided to add the user define his/her own loop macros. 
;;; See explanation and code in the file.
;;;
;;; HINTS
;;;
;;; On Translation time syntax checking: as clauses are independent macros, 
;;; translation time syntax checking will be clumbersome. The  values in 
;;; *loop-alist* will have to be used after that list is fully constituted.
;;;
;;; EXPORT CONTROL
;;;
;;; Note that all symbols that will be used in trio, or some other package, 
;;; have to be exported.

;;;     Examples of "programmer" defined loop macro functions. They are to
;;; function as their zetalisp loop counterparts. To define a yloop macro
;;; you must invoke the macro ADD-TO-LOOP-MACRO. This macro: 1)substitutes
;;; symbols (via gensym) so as to avoid symbol conflicts within the loop
;;; in the future; 2) provides requested local loop variables that will be
;;; within the lexical scope of the repeating statements (i.e. the loop),
;;; and ; 3)places the new code in the requested part of the
;;; loop. (Specifically the yloop macro is conceptually separated into 3
;;; parts: the FRONT, the MIDDLE and the end. Code that is in the FRONT of
;;; the yloop macro is executed after local bindings are made but before
;;; the executions of the statements to be repeated. Code that is in the
;;; MIDDLE of the yloop macro is executed after the FRONT code has been
;;; executed and is executed repeatedly until some termination condition
;;; is met. Code in the END of the yloop macro is executed after the loop
;;; terminates normally.)  The first argument to ADD-TO-LOOP-MACRO is to
;;; indicate where to place the new code.  It is to be one of FRONT MIDDLE
;;; END. The second argument is a list of desired local yloop
;;; variables. The syntax is to be the same as the car of let statements
;;; as that list will actually be placed at the position of the first
;;; argument in the let statement. The third argument is the variable
;;; which will given to the (return ) statement of the loop so that its
;;; value will be returned on normal termination of the loop. And the
;;; final arguments are to be the body of new macro to be inserted in the
;;; loop .
;;; 
;;; Hint When you want something returned, declare a new local loop
;;; variable, declare it as that which will be returned and set your
;;; answer to it.

 Examples of how to use these new yloop macros
 (Include yloop in your package if you don't want to type yloop:yloop.)

(yloop:yloop 
       (lfor x in '(a b cc))
       (initial (results nil))
       (result results)
       (ldo (format t "~% ~a" x)))

(yloop:YLOOP (INITIAL (RESULTS NIL))
       (LFOR DR IN '(5 10 20 50 100))
       (LDO (Push (Cons DR (/ 300 DR)) RESULTS))
       (RESULT (SETQ *DDD.RANGE.SCALES* (reverse RESULTS))))

(yloop:yloop
   (lfor a from 0 to 10)
   (sum a))                will return 55

(yloop:yloop
  (lfor a from 0 to 10)
  (lwhen (= a 5) 
         (format t "~% a = ~a" a)))
