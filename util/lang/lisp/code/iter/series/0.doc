Summary:      Common Lisp looping macro package 

Version:      November 26, 1991

Description: 

   The benefits of programming in a functional style are well known.  In
   particular, algorithms that are expressed as compositions of functions
   operating on series/vectors/streams of data elements are much easier
   to understand and modify than equivalent algorithms expressed as
   loops.  Unfortunately, many programmers hesitate to use series
   expressions.  In part, this is due to the fact that series expressions
   are typically implemented very inefficiently.

   The Common Lisp Series macro package evaluates a wide class of series
   expressions very efficiently by transforming them into iterative
   loops.  When using this class of series expressions, programmers can
   obtain the advantages of expressing computations as series expressions
   without incurring any run-time overhead.

Requires:
