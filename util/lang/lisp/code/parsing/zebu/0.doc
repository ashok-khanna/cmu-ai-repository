Package:      lang/lisp/code/parsing/zebu/

Name:         ZEBU

Summary:      Zebu parser/unparser generator for Common Lisp

Version:      3.4.8 (8-MAR-96); 3.3.6 (30-AUG-94); 3.3.2 (28-JUL-94)

Description: 

   Zebu is part of a set of tools for the translation of formal
   languages.  Zebu contains a LALR(1) parser generator like Yacc does.
   Aside from generating a parser, Zebu will also generate the inverse of
   a parser (unparser).  In contrast to Yacc, the semantics is not given
   in terms of ``routines'' but declaratively in terms of typed feature
   structures.  Syntax is specified using BNF-like productions and
   lexical categories are specified using regular expressions.

   Zebu generates a LALR(1) parsing table.  To parse a string with a
   grammar, only this table and a driver need to be loaded. The present
   version of Zebu contains the ability to define several grammars and
   parsers simultaneously, a declarative framework for specifying the
   semantics, capabilities to define and use meta-grammars (grammars to
   express a grammar in), as well as efficiency related improvements.
   The current version compiles a grammar with 300 productions (including
   dumping of the tables to disk) in approx 2 minutes and 30 seconds on a
   HP 9000/370.

   The current version can also produce a generator using a 'reversible
   grammar' notation, in addition to a parser.

   Documentation is included with the distribution.

   This implementation is an extension written in Common Lisp of the
   Scheme version. (The Scheme version was originally implemented by
   William M. Wells III.)   

   The 3.4.8 version contains changes that make it work with Allegro
   CL in Windows.

Requires:     

Ports:        Tested in Lucid CL and Allegro CL under HP-UX, and MCL
              2.0b on the Macintosh
