Summary:      Formatting of Parse Trees for Display

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains two programs for formatting parse trees for
   display.  

   The first is a simple portable tree indenter designed for natural
   language parse trees. It includes primitive facilities for printing
   subscripts, and is smart about breaking up long lines, such as
   formatting
      (s (np (det The) (noun cat)) (vp (verb chased) (np (det the) (noun mouse))))
   as
      (s (np (det The) (noun cat))
         (vp (verb chased)
             (np (det the) (noun mouse))))


   The second is a Macintosh Common Lisp program that draws parse trees
   in two dimensions, each tree in its own window.  The code uses MCL
   extensions to Common Lisp to create windows and draw graphics in them.
   (The result looks something like the example below, but with real
   graphics and in a real window, of course, not as ASCII art). The code
   supports all sorts of nifty features like sub- and superscripts at
   left and right, boldface and italics, different line shapes, weights,
   and fills, arbitrary connections between nodes, and more.
