Package:      lang/lisp/gui/winterp/

Name:         WINTERP

Summary:      Widget INTERPreter

Version:      2.03 (24-JUL-94)

Description: 

   WINTERP (Widget INTERPreter) is an application development environment
   developed at HP. It enables the rapid prototyping of graphical
   user-interfaces through direct manipulation of user interface objects
   and their attached actions.  WINTERP provides an interface to the X11
   toolkit (Xt) and the OSF/Motif widget set and a built-in RPC mechanism
   for inter-application communication.  It includes an object-oriented
   2.5D graphics and animation widget based on the Xtango path transition
   animation system, the XmGraph graph browser (with graph nodes as
   arbitrary WINTERP widgets), and GIF image support.  The interpreter is
   based on David Betz's XLISP interpreter, which implements a small
   subset of Common Lisp and runs on PCs, Decstation 3100s, HP9000s,
   Sun3, Sparcs, SGI, and NeXT.  XLISP provides a simple Smalltalk-like
   object system, with OSF/Motif widgets as real XLISP objects -- they
   can be specialized via subclassing, methods added or altered, etc.
   WINTERP includes an interface to GNU-Emacs which allows code to be
   developed and tested without leaving the editor.  WINTERP is a
   free-standing Lisp-based tool for setting up window applications.
