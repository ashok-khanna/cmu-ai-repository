I just released WINTERP 2.0 for the X Consortium X11r6 "contrib"
distribution.  Previous releases of WINTERP were distributed on the X11r4
and X11r5 distributions -- 2.0 is a significant update over previously
released versions (1.0-1.13). This software is now available for free via
anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org:/contrib/devel_tools/winterp-2.01.tar.gz

			--------------------

WINTERP: An object-oriented rapid prototyping, development and delivery
environment for building extensible applications with the OSF/Motif UI
Toolkit and Xtango-based graphics/animation.

			by Niels Mayer
			WINTERP Version 2.01
			June 6, 1994
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINTERP is a Widget INTERPreter, an application development environment
enabling rapid prototyping of graphical user-interfaces (GUI) through the
interactive programmatic manipulation of user interface objects and their
attached actions. The interpreter, based on David Betz, Tom Almy, et al's
XLISP-PLUS, provides an interface to the X11 toolkit Intrinsics, the
OSF/Motif widget set, primitives for collecting data from UN*X processes,
and facilities for interacting with other UN*X processes. WINTERP thus
supports rapid prototyping of GUI-based applications by allowing the user
to interactively change both the UI appearance and application
functionality. These features make WINTERP a good tool for learning and
experimenting with the capabilities of the OSF/Motif UI toolkit, allowing
UI designers to more easily play "what if" games with different interface
styles.

WINTERP is also an excellent platform for delivering extensible or
customizable applications. By embedding a small, efficient language
interpreter with UI primitives within the delivered application, users and
system integrators can tailor the static and dynamic layout of the UI,
UI-to-application dialogue, and application functionality. WINTERP's use of
a real programming language for customization allows WINTERP-based
applications to be much more flexible than applications using customization
schemes provided by the X resource database, OSF/Motif's UIL (user
interface language), and resource-based languages such as WCL.

An environment similar to WINTERP's already exists in the Gnu-Emacs text
editor -- WINTERP was strongly influenced by Gnu-Emacs' successful design.
In Gnu-Emacs, a mini-Lisp interpreter is used to extend the editor to
provide text-browser style interfaces to a number of UN*X applications
(e.g. e-mail user agents, directory browsers, debuggers, etc). Whereas
Emacs-Lisp enables the creation of new applications by tying together
C-implemented primitives operating on text-buffer UI objects, WINTERP-Lisp
ties together operations on graphical UI objects implemented by the Motif
widgets. Both achieve a high degree of customizability that is common for
systems implemented in Lisp, while still attaining the speed of execution
and (relatively) small size associated with C-implemented applications.

Other features:
	* WINTERP is free software -- available via anonymous ftp from
	  ftp.x.org.
	* Portable -- runs without porting on many Unix systems.	
	* Interface to GNU Emacs' lisp-mode allows code to be developed
	  and tested without leaving the editor.
	* Interactive programing also available in the "WINTERP Control Panel",
	  with editing taking place in a Motif text widget controlled by
	  WINTERP.
	* Built-in RPC mechanism for inter-application communications.
	* XLISP provides a simple Smalltalk-like object system.
	* OSF/Motif widgets are real XLISP objects -- widgets can be
	  specialized via subclassing, methods added or altered, etc.
	* Automatic storage management of all Motif/Xt/X data.
	* Contains facilities for "direct manipulation" of UI components.

The WINTERP 2.0 release includes the following new features:
	* High-level, object-oriented 2.5D graphics/animation package featuring
          pixel-independent/resizeable/scalable rendering, path-transition
	  animation, and high-level animation operators. This is based on
	  Stasko&Hayes' Xtango system.
	* Using Xtango, the ability to easily create new widget classes
	  employing arbitary graphical behavior without the tedium of
	  programming in the Xt instrinsics and Xlib.
	* Asynchronous subprocess facility enables non-blocking GUI interfaces
	  to existing interactive unix commands and interactive network
	  services. Enables use of multiple asynchronous subprocesses.
	* XmGraph widget for creating directed acyclic graphs, trees, and
          direct-manipulation displays.
	* Table widget allows constraint-based GUI static layout
          using tbl(1)-style specifications.
	* Uses XLISP-PLUS version 2.1c -- more functionality, better subset of
	  Common Lisp, e.g. good support for sequence operators.
	* Support for OSF/Motif 1.2.*
	* GIF Image Support.
	* Many new examples, improved example WINTERP applications.
	* Major code cleanups, bugfixes, etc.

WINTERP (for Widget INTERPreter) is a object-oriented tool kit developed
by Niels Mayer.  Developed in XLISP, WINTERP provides a number of advanced
features coupled with the flexibility and power of a small efficient LISP
language and object system.  2.0 was just released but I've used earlier
versions for projects as well as prototyping.

For those of you with World Wide Web browsers (e.g. Mosaic), I've just
created a home page for WINTERP 2.0 (OSF/Motif Widget INTERPreter). WINTERP
is a rapid prototyping, development and delivery environment for GUI-based
applications on Unix platforms. WINTERP fills the same needs as TCL/TK or
Python (or the windowing korn shell) but:
(0) Provides a complete, object-oriented user-interface toolkit based on
    the standard OSF/Motif widget set and the X toolkit.
(1) Uses a small, portable object-oriented Lisp interpreter
    (an event-driven version of Betz/Almy/Tierney-et-al's XLISP-PLUS).
(2) Other applications may send programmatic commands to WINTERP's
    interpreter via unix domain or internet domain sockets.
(3) High-level object-oriented 2.5D graphics and animation based on
    Stasko and Hayes' Xtango path transition animation paradigm.
(4) nonblocking GUI interfaces to multiple asynchronous interactive Unix
    subprocess (based on Don Libes' expect library with WINTERP extensions).

Best of all, WINTERP 2.0 is a "one stop shopping" free application
environment -- the full system (C-source, documentation, example programs)
is available in one tar file -- you don't have to run around the net
integrating interpreter, interface and "accessory" packages. Just add Motif
1.2, Unix, a C compiler, berkeley networking facilities (unix domain
sockets), and X11r5 or X11r6...  compile, and you're good to go. The system
is quite portable -- so far, I know that WINTERP 2.0 works on Irix, Ultrix,
OSF1, SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, Linux, NeXT-Step (w/ Co-Xist Motif/X), etc.

Anyways... the home page is accessible via the following URL:
	http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html
a copy of the page is also available from the X Consortium Ftp site:
	file://ftp.x.org/contrib/devel_tools/winterp.html

Expect this page to change/improve sometime after I return from vacation on
July 15. In particular, I plan to provide a HTML version of the WINTERP
documentation. And a page describing each of the WINTERP example
applications, with hypertext pointers to a screendump (GIF) of each
application and the code that created the screen. (Over 200 example
applications/UIs and test scripts are included with the WINTERP
distribution).
