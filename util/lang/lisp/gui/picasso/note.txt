Informational posting for those interested in the status of the Picasso
Graphical User Interface Development System - March 12, 1993.

This note is the ramblings of John Boreczky, "The last Picasso developer",
and anything that upsets you shouldn't be taken too seriously, and anything
you like, well, enjoy it.

Picasso version 2 release 0 does not work as released with Allegro CL
version 4.1.  It works fine with Lucid CL 4.0.X and Allegro CL 4.0.X.
It is unlikely that we will make a version 2 release 1 available since
there are no local Picasso users (see below), and any remaining work would
need to be done in the free time of a single grad student.

THE FUTURE OF PICASSO

Picasso has been declared a success and we are moving on.  One of our main
interests in Picasso has been for internal development of GUI applications.
Unfortunately, our best efforts at optimization were insufficient.  Using
the delivery toolkits provided by Lucid and Allegro and using a lot of
other optimizations resulted in cutting startup time by 50%, execution time
by 25%, and memory usage by 20%.  These improvements are impressive but not
enough to make using Common Lisp competitive with other options.  An
upcoming technical report (which we will make available for ftp) details
our efforts and results.  We are now using Tcl/Tk (C based) for our
distributed multimedia, video conferencing, and video-on-demand
applications.  No new Picasso development is taking place and we are
building replacements for the few Picasso applications that are used
internally.
