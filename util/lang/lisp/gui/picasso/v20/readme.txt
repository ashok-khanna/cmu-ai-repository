This is the Picasso Graphical User Interface Development System,
version 2 release 0.

To run Picasso, you must be using a Sun 4/Sparcstation running Allegro
Common LISP or Lucid Common LISP 4.0.X.  Picasso does not work with
Allegro CL 4.1 without modification. (see the picasso2.1-README file).

The file picasso-installation-notes will explain how to install
picasso.  You should have a lot (40-60 Megs) of available disk space to
install Picasso, and plenty of swap space too.

The pub/Picasso-papers ftp directory contains Picasso documentation
and other related papers.  Only minor changes were made to the Picasso
Reference Manual and Widget Writers Guide since Picasso 1.0.

If you choose to install this system, please send mail to: 

	picasso-list@postgres.berkeley.edu

with your name, address, and e-mail address.  Also please indicate
whether you wish to join the picasso-users mailing list.  Mail can be
sent to this list at

	picasso-users@postgres.berkeley.edu

Any bugs should be reported to 

	picasso-bugs@postgres.berkeley.edu

Enjoy!
