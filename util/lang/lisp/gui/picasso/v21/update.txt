Picasso version 2 release 1 - sort of.      June 8, 1993

The long-awaited (by at least person in the world) Picasso 2.1 update is
here.  What I have done is take all the files that have changed in our
source tree since the Picasso 2.0 release and tar'd them together.
The changes include a few minor bug fixes, a few spots where I added
some type declarations to see if it had an effect on performance, and
the addition of the attach and detach methods that are needed to really
make attach/detach work.  If you have made your own bugs fixes or changes,
you'll have to sort out what we changed and add what you like.  Just
remember that you will need to a copy of Picasso-2.0.tar.Z as well as
Picasso-2.1.tar.Z.

Keep in mind that this code is even less supported than the 2.0 release
(is it possible to have negative support?).  This code does run for us
and I have been able to do a bunch of attaching/detaching and other
performance tuning, so hopefully it will work for those brave enough
to try.

Once again, good luck and have fun.
