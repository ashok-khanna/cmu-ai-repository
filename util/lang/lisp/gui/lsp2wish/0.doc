Summary:      Simple demo of synchronous communication between Lisp
              and Tcl/Tk

Version:      6 (22-JUL-94)

Description: 

   LISP2WISH is a very simple demonstration of how to connect and
   communicate SYNCHRONOUSLY between a lisp process and a C process
   running a Tcl/Tk executable.  The demo uses the vanilla 'wish'
   executable that is included with the Tcl/Tk distribution.  

   Tcl/Tk is a very flexible system for building Graphical User
   Interfaces (GUIs), with the look-and-feel of Motif.  One writes
   scripts in a high-level, C-like language, and an interpreter evaluates
   the commands and passes execution either to a built-in function (and
   there are many), or to your own C routines.  Tcl/Tk is becoming
   increasingly popular because of its ease of use, and because it is
   freely distributable (even commercially, I believe).  For more
   information on Tcl/Tk, look on the USENET newsgroup comp.lang.tcl, or
   get the distribution from the archive (listed below) or
   ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.  The Tcl/Tk archive also has many
   user-contributed extensions which make Tcl/Tk even more desirable.
   Tcl/Tk was originally written by Dr. John Ousterhout, at Berkeley.

   LISP2WISH lets you make a window/menu/drawing interface for your lisp
   routines, where you can take advantage of all the stuff written for
   Tcl/Tk (and build your own!).

Requires:     Common Lisp, Tcl/Tk, X-Windows, awk

Ports:        LISP2WISH has only been tested under X-Windows and Lucid
              Common Lisp 4.0 and 4.1, but but should work on other
              platforms that support Lucid (or Allegro) and Tcl/Tk.
