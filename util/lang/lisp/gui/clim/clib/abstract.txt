                               Abstract

The Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) is used to develop graphical
user interfaces for Lisp-based applications. With the prototype of the
CLIM Interface Builder (CLIB) the programmer can generate code for CLIM
interactively. The developing process will be fast and less prone to errors.
With this new tool, the interactive rapid prototyping reduces costs of a
specification phase. Here we present the concept and first results of the
prototype of CLIB.

Keywords:

CLIM, Graphical User Interface, Interface Builder, Lisp, Rapid Prototyping


A prototype of a CLIM-Interface-Builder is being developed within a joint
effort of Forschungszentrum Informatik (FZI) and Symbolics Systemhaus GmbH.
