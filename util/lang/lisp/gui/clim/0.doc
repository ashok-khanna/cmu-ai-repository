Name:         CLIM Library

Summary:      Common Lisp Interface Manager code and documentation library

Description:

   CLIM is *not* free, so we are unable to provide a copy of the code.
   However, we have provided a (reorganized) version of the library of
   user contributed CLIM code maintained by Vincent Keunen, with some
   additions. The library includes CLIM utilities (browsers, ...),
   example code, and patches.
   
   The structure of the library is as follows:
       clib/            CLIM Interface Builder
       clim_1/          Contributed code that runs under CLIM 1.0
       clim_2/          Contributed code that runs under CLIM 2.0
       general/         Contributed code that runs under CLIM 1.0 and 2.0
       impl_dep/        Platform-specific CLIM code and patches
       mail/            Copy of archives of the CLIM mailing list
       papers/          Papers about CLIM and its add-ons
   
   CLIM (Common Lisp Interface Manager) is a portable, graphical user
   interface toolkit originally developed by International Lisp
   Associates, Symbolics, and Xerox PARC, and now under joint development
   by several Lisp vendors, including Symbolics, Franz, Lucid, Illudium,
   and Harlequin.  It is intended to be a portable successor of Symbolics
   UIMS (Dynamic Windows, Presentations Types).  CLIM 2.0 also supports
   more traditional toolkit-style programming. CLIM includes a general
   purpose grapher.  It runs on Symbolics Lisp Machines; Allegro, Lucid,
   and Harlequin on several Unix platforms; Symbolics CLOE on 386/486 IBM
   PCs running Windows; and MCL on Apple Macintoshes.  With the exception
   of Macintoshes, if it is available it can be purchased from the vendor
   of the Lisp system you are using.  For the Macintosh version write to
   Illudium: Dennis Doughty <Doughty@ileaf.com> or Bill York <york@lucid.com>.
   Illidium has signed a distribution agreement for MCL CLIM with
   Lucid, so you can also get it from Lucid at sales@lucid.com,
   415-329-8400. (Lucid also has a license to distribute MCL itself.)
