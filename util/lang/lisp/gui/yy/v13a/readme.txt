	README for YYonX version 1.3 alpha
							1991/03/19

The files placed here are the alpha versions.
This version is not executable yet for Symbolics machines.
Japanese front-end facility is under refinement.

Since we have X3J13 this week and ICERL'91 next week,
I decided to place a newer version here (rather than the old buggy 1.21).

Thank you.
