Package:      lang/lisp/gui/garnet/

Name:         GARNET

Summary:      One of the biggest and best GUIs for Lisp.

Version:      2.2 (15-OCT-93)

Description: 

   Garnet is a large and flexible GUI that includes lots of high-level
   features.  It does *not* depend on CLOS, but uses its own custom
   object system (called KR) instead. Garnet (version 2.0 and after)
   is now in the public domain, and has no licensing restrictions, so
   it is available to all foreign sites and for commercial uses.

   Garnet includes the Lapidiary interactive design tool, C32 constraint
   editor, spreadsheet object, Gilt Interface Builder, automatic display
   management, two widget sets (Motif look-and-feel and Garnet
   look-and-feel), support for gesture recognition, and automatic
   constraint maintenance, application data layout and PostScript
   generation.

   Garnet helps implement highly-interactive, graphical, direct
   manipulation programs for X11 in Common Lisp.  Typical applications
   include: drawing programs similar to Macintosh MacDraw, user interfaces
   for expert systems and other AI applications, box and arrow diagram
   editors, graphical programming languages, game user interfaces,
   simulation and process monitoring programs, user interface construction
   tools, CAD/CAM programs, etc.

Requires:     CLX

Ports:        Allegro CL, Lucid CL, CMU CL, Harlequin Lispworks, AKCL,
              CLISP and TI Explorer Lisps. The AKCL version is quite
              slow and hence not recommended.

   A number of old articles about Garnet were collected into a CMU
   Technical Report: "The Garnet Compendium: Collected Papers,
   1989-1990" CMU-CS-90-154, August 1990. A new compendium has
   recently been printed including 9 recent papers: "The Second Garnet
