Name:         CLUE and CLIO

Summary:      Common Lisp User-Interface Environment and
              Common Lisp Interactive Objects

Version:      7-1 (24-JAN-90), 7-20 (31-JUL-90)

Description: 

   CLUE (Common Lisp User-Interface Environment) is from TI, and extends CLX
   to provide a simple, object-oriented toolkit (like Xt) library that uses
   CLOS. Provides basic window classes, some stream I/O facilities, and a few
   other utilities. Still pretty low level (it's a toolkit, not widget
   library). Examples include a simple pop-up menu.

   CLIO (Common Lisp Interactive Objects) is a GUI from the people who created
   CLUE. It provides a set of CLOS classes that represent the standard
   components of an object-oriented user interface -- such as text, menus,
   buttons, scroller, and dialogs.  It is included as part of the CLUE
   distribution, along with some packages that use it, both sample and real.

   PICTURES is an object-oriented graphics package built on CLX, CLUE,
   and CLOS. It provides a set of classes for creating, transforming, and
   interacting with hierarchical structures of 2D graphical primitives.
