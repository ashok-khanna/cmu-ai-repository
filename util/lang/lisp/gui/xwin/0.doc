Summary:      Simple X windows for text output from LISP

Version:      30-DEC-91

Description: 

   XWIN is a simple hack for getting X-window text output from a LISP
   program. Rather than be tied into a LISP graphics package, it uses a
   shellscript to do the windows stuff, and drives the shell script from
   Lisp. This makes refresh run quite quickly.

   The code is short -- a page or two of Lisp code including comments --
   but lets you manage several X windows by name.

   On the LISP end the program refers to the X windows by name (a symbol
   or other EQ-able object).  It would have been even easier to just pass
   back the streams and let the program output to them directly, but that
   would require that the program pass them around or store them globally
   somewhere.  It also puts the need to do FORCE-OUTPUTs in the hands of
   the main program.  So XWIN lets the interface to maintain the list of
   streams.
