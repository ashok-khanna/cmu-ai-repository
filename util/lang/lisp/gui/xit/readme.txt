ABSTRACT:

XIT (X User Interface Toolkit) is an object-oriented user interface
development environment for the X Window System based on Common Lisp,
CLOS, CLX, and CLUE.  It has been developed by the Research Group
DRUID at the Department of Computer Science of the University of
Stuttgart as a framework for Common Lisp/CLOS applications with
graphical user interfaces for the X Window System.  XIT contains user
interface toolkits, including general building blocks and mechanisms
for building arbitrary user interface elements and a set of predefined
common elements (widgets), as well as high-level interactive tools for
constructing, inspecting, and modifying user interfaces by means of
direct manipulation.
