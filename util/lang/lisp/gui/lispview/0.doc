Package:      lang/lisp/gui/lispview/

Name:         LispView

Summary:      A GUI that doesn't use CLX.

Version:      1.1 (8-NOV-91); Fixes 13-JAN-92

Description: 

   LispView is a GUI written at Sun that does not use CLX.  Instead it
   converts Xlib.h directly into Lucid foreign function calls. It is
   intended to be fast and tight. LispView includes a general-purpose 2D
   grapher library, an interface to Sun's XGL 2.0 3D graphics library,
   and a generic scrollable list package.

   In addition to the usual X-Windows output functions for windows,
   LispView supports a sophisticated input model for handling events.

   LispView can also translate an interface developed with the OpenWindows(TM)
   Developers' Guide (Devguide) Interface Builder.

   The manual is in the doc/ subdirectory in PostScript (ps.tar.gz)
   or FrameMaker (frame.tar.gz) formats.

   The source code is in source.tar.gz and includes the generic source
   interface to the XView(TM) 2.0 libraries. The XView 2.0 libraries
   (with a patched libolgx) are in xview-libs.tar.gz. A LispView module
   built from the sources can be found in lispview-user.tar.gz. Demos,
   translators to/from Devguide, and some test files can be found in
   guide-etc.tar.gz. Utilities are in util.tar.gz.
