The source release of LispView(TM) Version 1.1 is now available for ftp from
export.lcs.mit.edu and xview.ucdavis.edu.

What Is LispView:
-----------------
LispView is a generic Application Programmer's Interface (API) that provides
Lisp programmers with a powerful set of tools to build sophisticated
Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; these tools include both GUI
components and basic window system services.  In addition to the available
GUI components, LispView supports output functions for windows (familiar to X
Window System programmers) as well as a sophisticated input model for
handling events.  LispView provides sets of generic functions for reading
and writing the state of an object. These include: label, choices, value,
mapped, state, layout, parent, and bounding-region. For example, to create a
window, you make an instance of the class window. Similarly, to create a
text field, you make an instance of text-field. To find the dimensions of
the window, apply the generic function bounding-region to it.  Use the same
function if you want the bounding region of the text field.

LispView can also translate an interface developed with the OpenWindows(TM)
Developers' Guide (Devguide) Interface Builder.

----------------
	src - LispView source code implemented in the Common Lisp Object System

	lispview.sbin - A LispView module built with the files in this
			source release
	demos - A few demo examples

	3D-graphics - an interface to Sun's XGL(TM) 2.0 graphics library
	list-viewer - a generic scrollable list package
	presentations - a mini-presentation type 
	with-fast-output - support for fast output
	textedit - a simple interface to the XView text editor
	contrib - a repository for user donated code
...and more

Getting and Unpacking the Release:
----------------------------------
LispView 1.1 source release:

	LispView-announce	This message
	Checksums		BSD style checksums of the tar.Z files
    And compressed tar files:
	doc-frame.tar.Z		Manual in Frame Maker format
	doc-ps.tar.Z		Manual (PostScript) and other doc
	guide-etc.tar.Z		guide, demos, test
	lispview-user.tar.Z	lispview.sbin, README files
	source.tar.Z		src and xview subdirs (except for libraries)
	util.tar.Z		Utilities
	xview-libs.tar.Z	XView 2.0 libraries (with a patched libolgx)

FTP sites for the LispView source:

Location        Machine Name            ftp login       ftp directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------
west coast      xview.ucdavis.edu       ftp             pub/XView/LispView1.1
east coast      export.lcs.mit.edu      ftp             contrib/lispview1.1

You will need about 5.3 Mb of disk space to hold the the compressed tar
files, which when unpacked, will require 13.3 Mb of additional disk space.

When transferring the compressed tar files via ftp, be sure to set binary
mode first.  Use the ftp "binary" and "mget" commands.  If you are doing an
"mget" and you want the entire release, you may want to use ftp with the
"-i" option to prevent it from asking you about every file.

To unpack a file <foo>.tar.Z in this release:

zcat <foo>.tar.Z  | (cd <sourcedir>; tar xvfp -)

The release will be unpacked into <sourcedir>/lispview1.1 and will look
something like this:

% ls lispview1.1
LEGAL_NOTICE   build.lisp     guide/         src/           xview/
README         demos/         lispview@      test/
README.build   doc/           lispview.sbin  util/
