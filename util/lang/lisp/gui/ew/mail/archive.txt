Welcome to the Express Windows mailing list.

This is an informal, unmoderated mailing list dedicated to the
discussion of topics and issues arising out of the use of Express
Windows.  

Express Windows is a package developed by Liszt Programming that runs on
top of either Lucid 3.0 or Allegro Common Lisp and CLX.  PCL is
optional.  Express Windows allows programs using a large subset of
Symbolics' Dynamic windows(TM) to run on general purpose hardware.

Express Windows can be found in the lisp directory on uunet.uu.net and
in the pub directory of trix.ai.mit.edu.  The title of the compressed
tar file is express-windows.tar.Z.  A copy of the copyright restrictions
can be found in the file COPYING included in the distribution.

Administrative requests (e.g., adding/deleting/changing addresses,
forwarding/resending of bounced mail, or anything else having to do with
mailing list administration) should be sent to:

    express-windows-request@atc.boeing.com

Submissions should be sent to:

    express-windows@atc.boeing.com

Is Express Window going to be to CLIM what PCL was to CLOS?

I must confess I have not installed and used EW yet, but I recall it implement
Dynamic Window stuff, which itself is the base for the Lisp Machine CLIM
implementation.

So it looks like EW and CLIM has some common points.

To: express-windows@atc

Well, to get the ball rolling, I suppose I'll list out some of the
changes we made to EW to get it to run in Lucid 3.0.2 on a Sun 3 (OS
4.0.X).  There's a long list of stuff we did.  I'll submit them as
groups in separate messages.  The first one will be in this message.

First of all we had to deal with a font name error when doing the
(clear-all).  tk@research.att.com gave us the solution which is appended
here.  Basically, the solution is correct the misspelling of the
'dec-adobe-...' fonts to '-adobe-...'.

the name-error is because a font EW is asking for doesn't exist.

That's my view.  Originally, EW was written to be a commercial product
that brought DW type functionality to other platforms.  At about the time they
were releasing EW for sale, it became apparent the CLIM was for the same
purpose, but had better industry backing.  So, my guess is that is why they made
EW public domain (i.e. free).  We are interested in using EW only because it's
free, and my guess is that when and if we get the funding to buy CLIM, we'd be
much better off using CLIM, because of all the obvious reasons like support, and
later generation software.

right, and the other advantage is that we now have codes which run on
the symbolics which use dynamic windows, and we'd like to be able to
just rcp those to the sun and compile and run them there...I don't

Subject: EW with May Day PCL
To: express-windows@atc

The version of PCL provided with EW is the AAAI Day version (August
1988).  Since we have been using Victoria Day, Rainy Day, and now, May
Day PCL, we knew we were gonna have to convert EW for those versions.

Here's a (hopefully somewhat complete and accurate) list of changes we
made that make EW compatible with May Day PCL (should be fine with Rainy
Day, too; don't know about Victoria Day, though).

1. Gave ":initarg"s to all slots in all the defclass forms.  The
:initarg should be a symbol in the keyword package with the same as the
name of the slot.

2. Removed use of :accessor-prefix in defclass forms, installing
":accessor" for every slot in every class.  The :accessor should be a
symbol with the name of the class prepended to the name of the slot
(with an intervening hyphen).

3. In frames.lisp, define-program-framework should use :initarg and
:accessor now.  So, replace

	  #+EW-CLOS
	  (defclass
	    ,name
	    (,inherit-from)
	    ,(mapcar #'(lambda (variable)
			 (if (consp variable)
			     `(,(first variable) :INITFORM ,(second variable))
			     variable))
		     state-variables)
	    (:accessor-prefix ,(intern (lisp-format NIL "~A-" name))))

with

	  #+EW-CLOS
	  (defclass
	    ,name
	    (,inherit-from)
	    ,(mapcar #'(lambda (variable)
			 (if (consp variable)
			     `(,(first variable)
			       :accessor ,(intern (lisp:format NIL "~A-~A" name (first variable))
						  (symbol-package name))
			       :initarg ,(intern (string (first variable)) :keyword)
			       :INITFORM ,(second variable))
			     variable))
		     state-variables))


4. Removed the &rest arguments in print-object methods in frames.lisp
and macros.lisp (and removed their corresponding (declare (ignore
ignore)) statements).

5. Added this form at the end of system.lisp in order for macros.lisp to
compile properly.

	(when (boundp 'pcl::*defclass-times*)
	  (pushnew 'compile pcl::*defclass-times*)
	  (pushnew 'compile pcl::*defmethod-times*))

6. In type.lisp, lisp-window.lisp, presentation-types.lisp,
flavors-to-pcl.lisp: change PCL::IWMC-CLASS-P to PCL::STANDARD-CLASS-P.

7. In lisp-window.lisp, calls to define-lisp-command with keyword args
broke lucid3.0 (">>Trap:  Bus error").  This is a PCL problem, I think.
What I did was to add an "&rest ignore" to the arglist if it has &key in
it.  Basically, it just looks for &key and splices in "&rest ignore" if
it finds it there.  While it seems to be only a PCL problem, it
shouldn't hurt any other CLOS's to do this (I hope).

So, in frames.lisp replace:

(defun get-argument-list (args)
  (let ((args (mapcar #'(lambda (arg)
			  (if (symbolp arg) arg
			      (list (first arg) (getf (cddr arg) :DEFAULT))))
		      args)))
    (when args
      (cons '&OPTIONAL args))))

with:

(defun get-argument-list (args)
  (let ((args (mapcar #'(lambda (arg)
			  (if (symbolp arg) arg
			      (list (first arg) (getf (cddr arg) :DEFAULT))))
		      args)))
    (let ((key-position (position '&key args)))
      (when key-position
	(cond ((zerop key-position) (setq args (append '(&rest ignore) args)))
	      (t (let* ((list (append '(&rest ignore) (nthcdr key-position args))))
		   (setq args (rplacd (nthcdr (%1- key-position) args) list))))))
      (when args
	(cons '&OPTIONAL args)))))

Subject: EW & CLX R4.x
To: express-windows@atc

EW comes with CLX R3.  Since we have been using the latest and greatest
versions of CLX (R4, then R4.1, and now R4.2), we had to make at least
one modification.

CLX R3 defined a macro called DECLARE-VALUES.  You either have to grab
the definition from R3 in file depdefs.lisp

	#+lispm
	(defmacro declare-values (&rest vals)
	  `(declare (sys:values ,@vals)))

	#-lispm
	(defmacro declare-values (&rest vals)
	  `(declare (values ,@vals)))

or just go through the EW code changing "(declare-values ...)" to
"(declare (values ...))".  

For no particular reason, we chose the latter approach.

From: Stephen L. Nicoud <snicoud@atc>
Subject: Miscellaneous mods to EW
To: express-windows@atc

Here are some miscellaneous changes we made to EW.

1. Since only Lispms seem to treat a variable called IGNORE as a special
case (i.e., ignorable, we added the form at the bottom of system.lisp to
suppress the numberous and annoying warnings about "Variable: IGNORE
bound but not referenced.":

	#-lispm
	(proclaim '(special ew::ignore))

The proper way to handle this is probably to go through and put (declare
(ignore ignore)) all over the place.  We decided to take the short cut.

2. We sprinkled (declare (ignore ...)) throughout the code for those
other "bound but not referenced" warnings and commented out unused
bindings.

3. symbols.lisp was shadowing CLEAR-INPUT, but it didn't seem to be
defined anywhere, so we commented it out of the list
EW::*Common-Lisp-Symbols-To-Shadow*.

4. x-interface.lisp changed "#+symbolics cl:pi #-symbolics user::pi" to
just lisp:pi.

5. We got tired of looking at all those undefined function warnings, so,
in system.lisp we changed:

(defun compile-ew ()
  (unless (fboundp 'compile-file-maybe)
    (load (make-pathname :NAME "defsystem" :TYPE "lisp"
			 :DEFAULTS *Default-EW-Code-Pathname*)))
  (dolist (file *Ew-Files*)
    (compile-file-maybe file)
    (load-file-maybe file))
  (dolist (file *Optional-Ew-Files*)
    (compile-file-maybe file)
    (load-file-maybe file)))

To:

(defun compile-ew ()
  (unless (fboundp 'compile-file-maybe)
    (load (make-pathname :NAME "defsystem" :TYPE "lisp"
			 :DEFAULTS *Default-EW-Code-Pathname*)))
  (#+lucid lucid::with-deferred-warnings
    #+symbolics compiler:compiler-warnings-context-bind
    #-(or lucid symbolics) progn
    (dolist (file *Ew-Files*)
      (compile-file-maybe file)
      (load-file-maybe file))
    (dolist (file *Optional-Ew-Files*)
      (compile-file-maybe file)
      (load-file-maybe file))))

6. We also cleaned up the load-ew.lisp and system.lisp pathname stuff.
Nothing important, just local customizations to the pathname
constructions that enhance portability between lispms and non lispms
without all the #+symbolics crap.  If you really, really want to see
this, let me know.

I guess I've viewed EW as strictly an implementation of DW for other
Common Lisps.  We are looking into using EW for a couple of reasons (1)
you can't beat the price (2) it offers way to get our DW-based
applications running on other customer's hardware quickly.  Personally,
I see it as only a temporary solution until we get, then convert to
CLIM.  

The rub is, though, I need portability for some of my work not today,
but yesterday, so I can't wait until CLIM gets released for all the
vendors.  Besides, (and you can debate the logic of having done this in
the first place) we've invested a great deal of time into developing our
current DW applications.  It's tough to go ask for money to RE-do old
work.  Management is always so interested in seeing new and more
functionality.

Subject: Express Windows on Symbolics
To: express-windows@atc
cc: Andrew L. Ressler <aressler@oiscola.columbia.ncr>

It just doesn't seem to me that EW is set up to be run on the Symbolics
very well.

For one thing :UNIX and :X are pushed onto the *FEATURES* list in
system.lisp.  Removing the :UNIX push is fine, but if you remove the :X
push, you're in trouble.  The XFONTS stuff (fonts.lisp) won't get
compiled.

The code is sprinkled with #+(and symbolics (not x)) and a form,
typically followed by a #+X and a form.  This suggests to me that the
Symbolics can be both a client and a server with and without X.

Now, I was successful in compiling EW on Symbolics (7.2) with CLX R4 and
May Day PCL.  I set the EW::*DEFAULT-HOST* to my Sun's name (thus the
Symbolics is merely the client), and did a (clear-all) [which after
prompting me to redefine all sorts of fonts to which I replied
(P)roceed].  The EW window came up just fine on my Sun.  I placed it
where I wanted it, and (clear-all) returned.  Next, I did (run-program
'lisp-window).  Sure enough the Lisp Window came up.  It even took a
command 'Show Environment'.  Only as soon as I touched the mouse, BANG,
ZOWIE, the windows disappeared and the (run-program 'lisp-window) form
ends up in the debugger complaining about timing out on mouse stuff.
I'm hosed from then on.  I can't run any more lisp-windows or
(clear-all) or anything, unless I reboot.

My (totally naive) guess is that there's some difference between CLX R3
and R4 which might explain this.   Can anyone verify this?  Any ideas?

So, all of this begs the question, "In what manner is EW to run on the
Symbolics?"  As client or server, with or without X?  The code seems to
indicate that EW can perform all, only I can barely get to fulfill an X
client role and not at all in any other capacity.  Right now, I need
code to run standalone on Symbolics (client and server, with no X) and
standalone in Lucid and Allegro (client and server, with X).

Of course, since EW::define-program-framework creates classes, I have to
rid myself once and for all of the message sending our applications do
to the program frameworks.  Ughh!

This looks like some PCL problem, possibly version diffs between that and the

Wait--
 I just got a bunch of EW mail, and it looks like this is explained; at least
somewhat.  However, if there's anyone who's got this running on ACL3.1
already, I'd be glad to hear about any special tweaks.

       The version of PCL provided with EW is the AAAI Day version (August
       1988).  Since we have been using Victoria Day, Rainy Day, and now, May
       Day PCL, we knew we were gonna have to convert EW for those versions.

       Here's a (hopefully somewhat complete and accurate) list of changes we
       made that make EW compatible with May Day PCL (should be fine with Rainy
       Day, too; don't know about Victoria Day, though).

    What do these PCL version designations correspond to? 

AAAI Day PCL is the August 1988 version
Victoria Day PCL is the May 1989 version
Rainy Day PCL is the February 1990 version
May Day PCL is the May 1990 version

May Day PCL is the final release of PCL. 

    How do I know which one I have?  

You can look at the variable PCL::*PCL-SYSTEM-DATE*, which is defined at
the top of the defsys.lisp file of the pcl directory.

    When I got EW I couldn't get it to run under lcl 3.0, so I ftped
    myself the latest pcl from arisia.xerox.com...

You will need to modify EW to run with Victoria, Rainy, or May Day PCL.
(see the previous message for a list of those modifications). Also note
that you should be able to compile EW without PCL at all, though I
haven't tried that myself.

    Okay, so I just got the big tar file and tried loading it.

    It just about all loaded, until the last file:

    This looks like some PCL problem, possibly version diffs between that and the
    in-core version on "Allegro CL 3.1.beta.22 [Sun4] (6/8/89)".

It's not a PCL problem per se, just that Allegro CL comes with Victoria
Day PCL which requires you to specify the :initarg for each slot in a
class.  The EW code is set up to use AAAI PCL (an earlier version) which
didn't have that requirement.  

We went through and added that option (:initarg) to every slot of every
defclass in EW (probably overkill, but we didn't want to take the time
to investigate which ones were initialized and which ones weren't).

	    Is Express Window going to be to CLIM what PCL was to CLOS?

	    I must confess I have not installed and used EW yet, but I recall it implement
	    Dynamic Window stuff, which itself is the base for the Lisp Machine CLIM
	    implementation.

	    So it looks like EW and CLIM has some common points.

	    Felix 

	That's my view.  Originally, EW was written to be a commercial product
	that brought DW type functionality to other platforms.  At about the time they
	were releasing EW for sale, it became apparent the CLIM was for the same
	purpose, but had better industry backing.  So, my guess is that is why they made
	EW public domain (i.e. free).  We are interested in using EW only because it's
	free, and my guess is that when and if we get the funding to buy CLIM, we'd be
	much better off using CLIM, because of all the obvious reasons like support, and
	later generation software.

	eric

    I guess I've viewed EW as strictly an implementation of DW for other
    Common Lisps.  We are looking into using EW for a couple of reasons (1)
    you can't beat the price (2) it offers way to get our DW-based
    applications running on other customer's hardware quickly.  Personally,
    I see it as only a temporary solution until we get, then convert to
    CLIM.  

    The rub is, though, I need portability for some of my work not today,
    but yesterday, so I can't wait until CLIM gets released for all the
    vendors.  Besides, (and you can debate the logic of having done this in
    the first place) we've invested a great deal of time into developing our
    current DW applications.  It's tough to go ask for money to RE-do old
    work.  Management is always so interested in seeing new and more
    functionality.

We held off using DW stuff, staying with Rel.6 message passing TV
windows, for as long as possible as it was not clear that there was any
general market for DW material outside Symbolics targets. This left us
in touch with the installed base of Smbx and TI (& LMI) machines along
with the limited GoldHill graphics we had to run on the PC.

Meanwhile, hacking DW on every possible non-persistant application as it
was so much more powerful and productive - if slow to run. CLOE was
embraced politically and found to be hard work, skinny and very late. 

So when CLIM/EW came along it seemed that the cheap and generalised
grownup lisps would at last be available widely. In Europe, there are
almost no Lispms available in academia. So the bright new graduates (and
hence new C s/w engineers in industry) know only of Lisp as that
headache with all the brackets and recursion. CLIM today is very tied up
with Symbolics, it will be some time coming and at a price.

We want a platform on which to float small utilities and gadgets in
powerful Lisp and one which we can share with the widest audience
possible. The market for Lispm developed systems seems to be confined to
enormous things like Concordia. The fact that EW is free is very
important as it will entice the participation of a lot of people who
wait and watch the doings of Lisp fraternity from the side lines -
fearful that any involment will necessitate the purchase of a Lisp
Machine (the cost of which, in Europe, is generally double that in the
US, and which brings technical and cultural isolation).

EW seems to offer a space before CLIM is dirt cheap or a standard, where
we can hope to give away Lisp applications whose value is based upon
what they can DO - rather than on the operating system licences and
hardware that are required to run the applications.

From: Andrew Ressler <ames!scubed!oiscola!aressler@uw-beaver.UUCP>
X-Mailer: Elm [version 2.1 PL1]


Hi,  I'm Andrew L. Ressler. The designer of Express Windows (EW).

For those of you using EW I should probably fill you in on a few details.

1. The general philosphy behind the design of EW was to make it easy to port
Genera 7.2 window applications from a Symbolics machine to other lisp
platforms.  In general, the emphasis was on speed, and not on full 100%
functionality.  I know of a couple things one can still do to improve the
speed of EW.  If any of you come up with better ways, please post them
to the world.

2. The license for EW is NOT as restrictive as GNU Emacs.  When
distributing software using Express Windows you need only to distribute
the source to EW.  You can do whatever you want with the code you build
on top of it. (i.e. charge for it, not give sources, etc.)

3. EW was designed under X11R3 and an older version of PCL.  It does work
under newer versions of either with only minor changes.  Most of which
people have already figured out.   

4. EW does not have to have CLOS or PCL to work.  If your application
does not need to build its own classes of windows so that you add
slots or methods to the basic windows, then EW can be compiled to use
defstructs for the windows.  In the original version as shipped this could
provide speedups of 20-30%.

5. EW seems to run faster in Franz Allegro than Lucid Lisp.  I think this
is mainly due to the low levels of CLX being faster.

6. EW was originally written on a Symbolics using Rel 6 style windows.
That's why you may see some obsolete references to symbolics style windows
in the code.  It WILL STILL work as a CLIENT on a symbolics, but it must
drive an X server.  I have not tried the Symbolics X server.  But it works
very nicely driving a SUN.

7. You can easily make your code so that it will port between a Symbolics
and non-Symbolics and back by carefully declaring and using packages.
EW can use the same symbols in the same packages as symbolics if you want.
That way your code can use dw:define-presentation-action and when it is
on a Symbolics it will use Genera and when it is not on Symbolics it will
use EW.

8. EW is not completely compatible with Symbolics Genera.  In some cases,
this is because some people depend on behavior of Genera that was not fully
documented.  In other cases, I had to make tradeoffs so that EW would
perform OK.
  a. For instance, Incremental Redisplay does not try to be clever about
     redisplaying graphics that have been obscured by something that has
     since been erased.  This would not be to hard to add, but would
     certainly slow things down.
  b. Several obscure, seldomly used keywords to the supplied functions are
     not implemented.  This was done to minimize the overall size of EW.

9. EW is coded using Common Lisp - CLX - and CLOS (PCL).  It should not
depend on anything else.  Therefore, If you have a lisp that CLX and CLOS
run in, then you should be able to port EW with almost no changes.
I personally only know of people using EW with Franz and Lucid running on
Sun 3s and 4s.  If anybody has ported to other platforms please let
us know.  For instance, Anybody using it on Apollo machines?

10. Feel free to call me to discuss EW (whether for good or bad) at
301-643-4526.  However, I'm out of town a lot consulting so you may
need to be persistent to get me.  I also read mail on the net 2 weeks
out of 4 at aressler@oiscola.columbia.ncr.com

Thanks for using EW and I hope you like it.

Andrew L. Ressler

Subject: EW-CLOS feature


Although I am led to believe that EW can be compiled with or without
PCL, there appears to be a problem when I try to compile without PCL.
If I answer *no* to the questions about loading and compling CLOS,
then the following problem occurs.


The file <ew>/code/system.lisp does a (pushnew :EW-CLOS *Features*)

Then the file <ew>/code/symbols.lisp contains the form

#+ew-clos
(import '(pcl::with-slots pcl::defclass pcl::defmethod pcl::make-instance pcl::print-object)
	'express-windows)

which looks for the (non-existant because I didn't load it) pcl package


What should I be doing here?

EW will work without PCL.  Unfortunately, I forgot that that mode
hadn't been tested lately, so a few things crept in to make it easier
for people using PCL.  The particular bug you refer is not really a bug
and is fixed by just commenting out the pushnew of :EW-CLOS.  This should
fix most things.

However, there is still one small sticky point that I was never sure which
way to do.  That has to do with the class object created by a
 DEFINE-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.
You may need to make a minor mode there to get it to do the "right"
thing.  Whatever you think it should be.  It may be that you want the window
objects to be defstruct, but would still like the program object to be
a class.  The appropriate code to look at is in the same file that
DEFINE-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK is in.

The best documentation would be to use Symbolics.
I think you can buy their documentation, but I'm not sure.
The most useful manual is 7A of their documentation that was

These variables can be ignored, in fact they could be eliminated.  They
are part of an idea that I never finished.  The idea was that multiple-
choice type accepts could be disabled, but still in the menu.  When disabled
they would be displayed with gray text (not solid black).  It's a nice
hack that I've seen done in InterViews.

    Hi,  I'm Andrew L. Ressler. The designer of Express Windows (EW).

First of all, I'd like to thank Andrew for making Express Windows freely
and easily available.  We are excited at the prospect of getting our
DW-based applications running on our Suns.

    10. Feel free to call me to discuss EW (whether for good or bad) at
    301-643-4526.  However, I'm out of town a lot consulting so you may
    need to be persistent to get me.  I also read mail on the net 2 weeks
    out of 4 at aressler@oiscola.columbia.ncr.com

For everyone's information, Andrew is on the mailing list for Express
Windows, so postings there will make it to him.  I urge everyone to cc:
express-windows@atc.boeing.com on any messages about Express Windows to
Andrew.  Chances are, that if you have a question, someone else (most
likely me) also has the same question and we can all benefit by the
exchange.

    Thanks for using EW and I hope you like it.

    Andrew L. Ressler

In case any of you were wondering, the Express Windows list currently
contains 77 addresses, many of which are distribution mailboxes at other
organizations.  I'm still getting half a dozen or so requests to be
added each day.  Obviously, interest in Express Windows is substantial.

That's the May Day version I pulled down a couple of weeks ago.  The

REV 1 of May Day PCL was released on 5/1/90 hence the name May Day.
Because of some minor problems, though, Gregor posted a new and

various patches people have mailed out.  The patches that didn't get
included were the ones that had more to do with the programming
environment.

Barring unforseen circumstances, this is the last release of PCL I will
produce.

	Near as I can tell (having just loaded it) the version now on
	arisia is Victoria day. Where are the later versions??

    Hmmm, that's odd.  I just checked arisia.xerox.com.  Here's what I
    found:

Hmm. Right you are. My file sez the same thing, though evaling
the var gives, and I know I booted since compiling the new
system and loaded the new one (becaue of all the stuff that
broke :-).

pcl::*pcl-system-date*
"5/22/89  Victoria Day PCL"

Must have been something I did :-)... 

Thanks for the confirm.

Anyone have ideas for adding color to EW?

I'm working on an interface to demo in <4 weeks.  I just got EW up and
running, and looked at the demos.  I know CLX moderately well, though haven't
played with it in color much.  Boss would like color to wow crowds.

I'll try to get my hands on some genera 7.2 docs and see how it's handled there.
Something clean & compatible would be best, but if I have to resort to quick
and dirty, I will.

How about samples that run under the symbolics, to compare with?
I'm off to hijack a LM now, so

Color should be straight forward to add.  I never had a color monitor
so I could test anything though.  Each drawing primitive can take a COLOR
keyword argument that could be a simple object with slots for RGB.  Then
inside the with-gcontext you would pass the appropriate information from the\
color object to the gcontext.  You would also need to add a slot to the
base level presentation if you want the color to be remembered.

I don't think symbolic's color objects are much more complicated than that.
Of course, you can always add fancy primitives for building appropriate colors.
You would also want to minimize consing color objects on the fly.

Call me at 803-739-7812 in the next few days if you want to discuss it furthur.

To my knowledge the ONLY publicly available (anonymous ftp) version of
EW can be had from either:

	trix.ai.mit.edu  [IP Address: 128.52.32.6]
	(in the /pub directory)

or

	uunet.uu.net [IP Address: 192.48.96.2]
	(in the /lisp directory)

The file on both hosts is called express-windows.tar.Z (dated April 3rd
on trix and April 2nd on uunet).

I'm curious what people think about the following:

Do People want Express Windows to evolve into a Public Domain
version of CLIM or at least to be more compatible or do they prefer
it for now to be more like the original Dynamic Windows?

If the answer is that you would like it to evolve to be more like CLIM
are you willing to help add functionality to make it that way?
Or would you be interested in funding furthur development of EW similar
to the GNU software?

What major features of DW do you wish it supported that is doesn't now.
    1. format-graph ?? for example
    2. ????

What major features do you not care about?

How important is a small compact window system? (i.e. takes up less than
2 megabytes in your image)

Thanks Peter.
We need to coordinate this a little.  Does this mean you will be able
to maintain a copy of EW that sites in UK/Europe will be able to FTP
from?  There have already been some fixes sent around so you would need
to update the version from what you got from MIT.
Also it would be good to make sure you advertise any new things you  put
in the version you are keeping.

Now we also need to find a site in the USA.
Any more volunteers?

Subject: EW under Apollo Domain Lisp

We are attempting to compile EW under Apollo's Domain/Common Lisp
(a product of Lucid) with CLOS and CLX.  We have been hung up on the
file io-functions.lisp because:
1. It appears to redefine standard lisp functions, and *then* call
the function (setup-lisp-functions) which is designed to take care of 
saving away the old version of the functions.
2. It uses pcl internals to handle type checking instead of CLOS
functions.  Simply adding (IN-PACKAGE 'CLOS :NICKNAMES '(PCL))
to the system file doesn't solve the problem.

Does anyone have a version of EW which compiles correctly on
a CLOS, CLX, and CLtL2 version of Common Lisp?

From: poesio@cs.rochester.edu


Hi! I am trying to install express windows for lucid 3.0,
on a Sun SPARC, and the window system is X11 (I can grab the exact version
if relevant). 
The problem I have is the following:
I have compiled the files OK, loaded them,
and executed (clear-all).
At this point, the following error message appears:

> (clear-all)
>>Error: X-Error: NAME-ERROR in request 121 (last request was 158)  Code 45.0 [O

   Rest arg 1 (KEYARGS): (:DISPLAY #<DISPLAY  0> :ERROR-KEY XLIB:NAME-ERROR :MAJ

this is the status of the stack:

   Optional arg 2 (SET-LINE-HEIGHT): T

It seems, of course, that the problem occurs when EXPRESS-WINDOWS:SET-WINDOW-STYLE
tries to get the height of
the font -adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1
(which is what XLIB:GET-FONT-FROM-STYLE returns for the style (:FIX :ROMAN :NORMAL))
using the macro RECOMPUTE-LINE-HEIGHT.
It may help to know that in order to get this far I had to make the
following changes to the files I ftp-ed from uunet.uu.net:

1) 	change the suffix `lbin' to `sbin' (for the SPARC compiler)
	in LOAD-EW and the value of *Binary-File-Type* as follows:

	;;(defvar *Binary-File-Type* #+Excl "fasl" #+lucid "lbin" #+symbolics "BIN")     ;; OLD
	(defvar *Binary-File-Type* #+Excl "fasl" #+lucid "sbin" #+symbolics "BIN")       ;; NEW

2)	change the value of *Default-Host* in x-interface.lisp from "Electro" to "".


	Thanks

This is a known bug.  The solution is to correct the misspelling of the

The problem is in the definition of type-of. PCL appears to not allow
the use of type-of to find the type of a class so EW does one of
it's little substitution tricks to redirect this call to the right PCL
call. (typep pcl::standard-class-p <object>) Unfortunatley this function
does not exist in CLOS. Fortunatley CLOS can use type-of to return the
type of a class. Use #-clos to switch out the defintion of type-of in
type.lisp, the references to type-of in *functions-shadowed* in
io-functions.lisp and *common-lisp-functins-shadowed* [or something] in
symbols.lisp.  This will then prevent shadowing type-of in the package
EW when CLOS is loaded.

This assumes that no one has :clos in their *features* unless they really
have CLOS and not just PCL.  

    Does anyone have a version of EW which compiles correctly on
    a CLOS, CLX, and CLtL2 version of Common Lisp?

io-functions is used to allow standard CL io functions to interface with
the presentation substrate.  That way functions like PRINT will work
inside of functions like WITH-OUTPUT-AS-PRESENTATION.  Since I didn't have
access to the internals of such functions as PRINT I needed to redefine them
so that they would handle the presentations as well as perform their
appropriate behavior.  Unfortunately, if there is an interaction with the
system's primitives
they tend to crash horribly.  The best thing to debug is to change the file
so that only one function is defined at a time until you see which causes
the problem.

It shouldn't be to hard to find out which is the proper CLOS function.
Unfortunately, I'm not in front of the code this week and can't tell you.
However, fixing this may solve all your problems.

Hope this helps.

When you start fixing up your calls with respect to type-of, pay careful
attention to the code that does type matching for presentations.
For instance, subtypep may do different things as well.  One problem I had
was that the behavior of subtypep was not consistent between Lucid, Franz,
and Symbolics.  If your lisp handles types correctly you may be able to
eliminate several hacks like the above mentioned hack.

    I copied Express Windows software from the  public  directory  of
    trix.ai.mit.edu  and  tried  compiling the files using Allegro CL
    3.1.4. I started getting different error messages and it was  not
    able  to  compile  some  of  the  files  [lisp-window.lisp, file-
    manager.lisp,  system.lisp,  processes.lisp,  demos.lisp,   menu-
    definer.lisp, sym-comp.lisp, clx-hacks.lisp].

	[...]

    Error: Invalid initialization argument :NAME for class PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK

	[...]

All of these "Invalid initialization argument" errors are the result of
using a version of PCL newer than AAAI PCL (AAAI PCL (August 1988) being
the one packaged in the Express Windows files).  You will need to
perform several modifications to the Express Windows code in order to
get it to run in this newer version of PCL (Victoria Day (May 1989), in
your case, being the version of PCL supplied with Franz's Allegro CL).
See the attached message which recently appeared on express-windows.

Subject: EW with May Day PCL
To: express-windows@atc.boeing.com

The version of PCL provided with EW is the AAAI Day version (August
1988).  Since we have been using Victoria Day, Rainy Day, and now, May
Day PCL, we knew we were gonna have to convert EW for those versions.

Here's a (hopefully somewhat complete and accurate) list of changes we
made that make EW compatible with May Day PCL (should be fine with Rainy
Day, too; don't know about Victoria Day, though).

1. Gave ":initarg"s to all slots in all the defclass forms.  The
:initarg should be a symbol in the keyword package with the same as the
name of the slot.

2. Removed use of :accessor-prefix in defclass forms, installing
":accessor" for every slot in every class.  The :accessor should be a
symbol with the name of the class prepended to the name of the slot
(with an intervening hyphen).

3. In frames.lisp, define-program-framework should use :initarg and
:accessor now.  So, replace

	  #+EW-CLOS
	  (defclass
	    ,name
	    (,inherit-from)
	    ,(mapcar #'(lambda (variable)
			 (if (consp variable)
			     `(,(first variable) :INITFORM ,(second variable))
			     variable))
		     state-variables)
	    (:accessor-prefix ,(intern (lisp-format NIL "~A-" name))))

with

	  #+EW-CLOS
	  (defclass
	    ,name
	    (,inherit-from)
	    ,(mapcar #'(lambda (variable)
			 (if (consp variable)
			     `(,(first variable)
			       :accessor ,(intern (lisp:format NIL "~A-~A" name (first variable))
						  (symbol-package name))
			       :initarg ,(intern (string (first variable)) :keyword)
			       :INITFORM ,(second variable))
			     variable))
		     state-variables))


4. Removed the &rest arguments in print-object methods in frames.lisp
and macros.lisp (and removed their corresponding (declare (ignore
ignore)) statements).

5. Added this form at the end of system.lisp in order for macros.lisp to
compile properly.

	(when (boundp 'pcl::*defclass-times*)
	  (pushnew 'compile pcl::*defclass-times*)
	  (pushnew 'compile pcl::*defmethod-times*))

6. In type.lisp, lisp-window.lisp, presentation-types.lisp,
flavors-to-pcl.lisp: change PCL::IWMC-CLASS-P to PCL::STANDARD-CLASS-P.

7. In lisp-window.lisp, calls to define-lisp-command with keyword args
broke lucid3.0 (">>Trap:  Bus error").  This is a PCL problem, I think.
What I did was to add an "&rest ignore" to the arglist if it has &key in
it.  Basically, it just looks for &key and splices in "&rest ignore" if
it finds it there.  While it seems to be only a PCL problem, it
shouldn't hurt any other CLOS's to do this (I hope).

So, in frames.lisp replace:

(defun get-argument-list (args)
  (let ((args (mapcar #'(lambda (arg)
			  (if (symbolp arg) arg
			      (list (first arg) (getf (cddr arg) :DEFAULT))))
		      args)))
    (when args
      (cons '&OPTIONAL args))))

with:

(defun get-argument-list (args)
  (let ((args (mapcar #'(lambda (arg)
			  (if (symbolp arg) arg
			      (list (first arg) (getf (cddr arg) :DEFAULT))))
		      args)))
    (let ((key-position (position '&key args)))
      (when key-position
	(cond ((zerop key-position) (setq args (append '(&rest ignore) args)))
	      (t (let* ((list (append '(&rest ignore) (nthcdr key-position args))))
		   (setq args (rplacd (nthcdr (%1- key-position) args) list))))))
      (when args
	(cons '&OPTIONAL args)))))

You missed the package for MAKE-WINDOW.
(find-all-symbols "MAKE-WINDOW") will help you find it.

I use find-all-symbols all the time when I'm stumbling through packages.. try
this alias for your allegro:

(tpl:alias ("fas" :string) (sym-name)
	   (let ((finds (find-all-symbols (string-upcase sym-name))))
	     (format t "~s~%" finds)
	     ;; and return value, so accessible by * at top-level.
	     finds
	     ))

and then you'll see

<cl> :fas make-window
(XLIB::MAKE-WINDOW EXPRESS-WINDOWS:MAKE-WINDOW)

T


good luck,

QUESTION 2 ::
------------

Is it possible to make a dumplisp file after loading the files of
express-windows ?  If so, could you tell me how ?
 It was getting stuck when I tried dumping into a file.

The steps I followed after starting the LISP were,

1.  (use-package :cw)
2.  (initialize-common-windows :gc-cursor 't)
3.  (load "pcl.fasl")
4.  (load "clx.fasl")
5.  (load "load-ew.lisp")
6.  (require :xcw)
7.  (excl:dumplisp :name "ewcl" :checkpoint t :read-init-file t)


Thanx for the Help.

You can't make a window until you call (initialize-window-system).

Have you tried running the demos, by doing
 :pa ew
 (run-program 'lisp-listener)      ; see frames.lisp

The mouse window should show you what the buttons do.
Click right to get a menu, or type S<space>M<space>, which is an abbreviation
for System Menu.

You don't need to load the common windows at all, just CLX.  I don't think
this should cause any problems; at its most harmless will probably only make
method dispatch just a little bit slower.

---------------------------------
Here's what I just tried:

<cl> (initialize-window-system)

NIL
<cl> *root-window*

#<PRESENTATION-WINDOW 70014576>               ;this is default superior if I don't specify
<cl> (setq w2 (make-window 'WINDOW :BORDERS 1
			   :LEFT   10 :TOP    10
			   :HEIGHT 250 :WIDTH  400))

#<PRESENTATION-WINDOW 72343356>

<cl> (expose-window w2)
;;; now we see it
NIL 
<cl> (let ((*query-io* w2))
       (querying-values (*query-io* :label "Just a test.")
			(query '((alist-member :alist (one two three)))
			       :prompt "Choose one" :default 'two)))

THREE 
<cl> (print "Hello." w2)

"Hello." 
<cl> (force-output w2)   ; forces out any waiting output.

NIL 
<cl>


Normally, your application will be using Express-Windows for input, and the
output will automatically be flushed, so (force-output ..) is rarely necessary.
You can also use (sync) for this, which will take care of any waiting output
(for the X display).

Again, you should look at the demos for example i/o coding and use of
define-program-framework.

---------------------------------
BUILDING A CORE:

Here's how I did it.  If the following is make-ew-core.lisp, then (in allegro)
cl -qq < make-ew-core.lisp > make-ew-core.output

You'll have to load pcl & clx yourself (my core already had these).
Note that I call (load-ew) directly, otherwise I would be prompted for
(compile, load) x (pcl, clx, ew).

Also, I put the optional files onto the ew-files, and set optional files to
(), so I don't get prompted for those either.  You might want to replace the
call to (load-ew) with similar loading code, depending on your needs.

------------
;;; Dump a core with express windows loaded.


(in-package :user)

#+excl
(unless (excl::scheduler-running-p)
  (mp:start-scheduler))


(load (make-pathname :name "system" :type "lisp" :defaults *Default-EW-Code-Pathname*))

;; Don't ask about optional files, just do 'em

(setf *Ew-Files-Copy* (append *Ew-Files-Copy* *Optional-Ew-Files-Copy*)
      *Optional-Ew-Files-Copy* ())

(user::load-ew)

(setq ew::*Default-Host* "unix")  ; will this give better results?

;;; Okay, now save the world...

(excl:chdir "/usr/toad/")

;; are these necesary?  right order?
(excl:gc t)
(excl:gc :tenure)

(excl:dumplisp :name "express"
	       :read-init-file t
	       :restart-function nil
	       ; :restart-actions nil
	       :checkpoint nil)

(print "Core dumped.")

(excl:exit 0 :no-unwind t)

---------------------------------
It was my first dumplisp for allegro, and though it works, I'm not satisfied
with the way (room) looks; there seems to be several empty oldspaces taking
up a couple meg, and the core file is 12M (on a sparc (RISC)); space in core
(by (room)) shows 6.5M used.  I tried a couple gc tweaks, but it didn't seem
to change.  Anyone have hints?

    I'm curious what people think about the following:

    Do People want Express Windows to evolve into a Public Domain
    version of CLIM or at least to be more compatible or do they prefer
    it for now to be more like the original Dynamic Windows?

My main requirement is user-interface compatibility/portability.  CLIM
would appear to give me a very clean way to do this.  My use of Express
Windows has been, so far, strictly temporary in nature.  A stopgap until
CLIM.

I am concerned, however, about the cost of CLIM.  Not so much for me as
for my (potential) users.  The more they have to buy, the less
attractive my systems become.  To that end, a public domain CLIM would
really help.  The fact that EW uses CLX/PCL makes it desirable on this
very point.

    If the answer is that you would like it to evolve to be more like CLIM
    are you willing to help add functionality to make it that way?

Aye, there's the rub.  While I can certainly offer lots of
encouragement, commitment of personal assistance isn't something I can
promise.

    Or would you be interested in funding furthur development of EW similar
    to the GNU software?

I don't think I can sell my management on providing the entire funding
for a public domain CLIM.  Perhaps if you made a proposal for funding
that involved other corporations/institutions,... perhaps.  Can you
estimate time/cost for such a venture?

    What major features of DW do you wish it supported that is doesn't now.
	1. format-graph ?? for example
	2. ????

Our Symbolics-based systems make extensive use of the
FORMAT-GRAPH-FROM-ROOT function.  Our non-Symbolics based system use
their own graphing code or do without a graphing capability.  It would
be nice to have FORMAT-GRAPH-FROM-ROOT available for all systems, since
this is such a universally needed feature.

    What major features do you not care about?

    How important is a small compact window system? (i.e. takes up less than
    2 megabytes in your image)

Currently, size of the image is not a major concern for me.

    Thanks,

Subject: Program Framework Title Panes and REDISPLAY-FUNCTION
To: express-windows@atc

I'm having problems getting output to the title pane of a program
framework using :redisplay-function.  Perhaps someone can identify a way
to modify my code to get the desired effect.

Assuming I have a program framework defined with a title pane like this:

(DW:DEFINE-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK
	.
	.
	.
  :PANES
  ((TITLE :TITLE :HEIGHT-IN-LINES 3 :REDISPLAY-AFTER-COMMANDS NIL
	   :REDISPLAY-FUNCTION #'ERASMUS-FRAME-TITLE)
   (LISTENER :LISTENER :HEIGHT-IN-LINES 30
	       :TYPEOUT-WINDOW T
	       :more-p nil
	       :deexposed-typeout-action :permit
	       :BLINKER-P T
	       :MARGIN-COMPONENTS '((DW:MARGIN-BORDERS :THICKNESS 1)
				    (DW:MARGIN-LABEL :STRING "Erasmus Listener"
						     :STYLE (:FIX :ITALIC :NORMAL))
				    (DW:MARGIN-SCROLL-BAR :MARGIN :BOTTOM)
				    (DW:MARGIN-SCROLL-BAR :MARGIN :LEFT)))
	...)
	.
	.
	.
   )

For the Symbolics version of the title pane's redisplay function
(ERASMUS-FRAME-TITLE) here's what we have:

(defun erasmus-frame-title (program stream)
  (declare (ignore program))
  (send stream :set-default-character-style '(:dutch :bold :large))
  (multiple-value-bind (ignore y)
      (send stream :draw-horizontally-centered-string "Erasmus" 0)
    (send stream :set-default-character-style '(:fix :roman :very-small))
    (send stream :draw-horizontally-centered-string
	  "COPYRIGHT (C) 1990 THE BOEING COMPANY" 
	  (+ y 2))))

The intent is to write "Erasmus" and "COPYRIGHT (C) 1990 THE BOEING
COMPANY" in the title pane.  The method
:DRAW-HORIZONTALLY-CENTERED-STRING is a locally defined method which
centers the strings in the window.

We tried this as an EW alternative:

(defun erasmus-frame-title (program stream)
  (declare (ignore program))
  (ew::set-window-style stream '(:dutch :bold :large))
  (multiple-value-bind
    (ignore y)
      (draw-horizontally-centered-string stream "Erasmus" 0)
    (ew::set-window-style stream '(:fix :roman :very-small))
    (draw-horizontally-centered-string stream
	  (format nil "COPYRIGHT (C) ~s THE BOEING COMPANY"
		  (multiple-value-bind (sec min hr day mo yr) (cl:get-decoded-time)
		    (declare (ignore sec min hr day mo)) yr))
	  (+ y 2))))

The problem is that "Erasmus" is not drawn on the screen at all (or that
I can see).  The "COPYRIGHT ..." string appears in the Listener Pane (it
is centered, though :-) and it doesn't appear to be in the proper
font/character-style.

Here's the definition for :DRAW-HORIZONTALLY-CENTERED-STRING for the
Symbolics:

tv:
(defmethod (:draw-horizontally-centered-string graphics-mixin)
	   (string from-y &optional (font current-font) (alu char-aluf)
		   (inside-width (send self :inside-width)) (xoffset 0))
  "Draw string centered on the line whose y-coordinate is from-y; i.e. the top of
characters drawn will be at from-y.  string will be centered with respect to the
horizontal region from xoffset to (xoffset + inside-width).  Use font and alu
as specified.  The default behavior is to ceneter the string with respect to the
entire line"
  (let* ((string-width (erasmus::string-pixel-width string font))
	 (from-x (+ xoffset (max 0 (floor (- inside-width string-width) 2))))
	 (char-alu char-aluf))
    (setq current-font font char-aluf alu)
    (send self :set-default-character-style (si:backtranslate-font font))
    (send self :set-cursorpos from-x from-y)
    (send self :string-out string)
    (setq char-aluf char-alu)
    (values from-x (+ from-y
		      (send self :vsp)
		      (zl:font-char-height current-font)))))

and our try at a version for EW:

(pcl:defmethod draw-horizontally-centered-string ((self ew::program-title-pane)
	   string from-y &optional (font (ew::window-font self)) alu
		   (inside-width (ew::window-inside-width self)) (xoffset 0))
  (declare (ignore alu))
  (let* ((string-width (string-pixel-width string font))
	 (from-x (+ xoffset (max 0 (floor (- inside-width string-width) 2)))))
    (setf (ew::window-font self) font)
    (ew::set-window-style self (xfonts::backtranslate-font font))
    (ew:draw-string string from-x from-y)
    (values from-x (+ from-y
		      (ew::window-line-spacing self)
		      (ew::font-height font)))))

BTW, we defined a function called BACKTRANSLATE-FONT in fonts.lisp:

(defun backtranslate-font (font &rest ignore)
  (if (equal font *Cached-Font*) *Cached-Font-Style*
      (loop named find-the-font
	    for family in *font-table*
	    do (loop for faces in (rest family)
		     do (loop for (size xfont) in (rest faces)
			      when (equal xfont font)
				do (return-from find-the-font (list (first family) (first faces) size)))))))

Any ideas, thoughts?  I guess the stream passed to ERASMUS-FRAME-TITLE
should be a stream for the TITLE pane.  I s'pose I should go digging
through the code to find it ...  Naw, it's the end of the day.
Tomorrow, ...  maybe.  :-)

My 5 second thought is that you made the title pane, then set it's
character style in #'ERASMUS-FRAME-TITLE. If '(:dutch :bold :large) has
a larger line height than the default ((:fix :roman :normal)?) then
there is no room to write out anything.

Fix: give the title pane a :default-character-style in the :panes title
field and remove it from the drawing function.

(PS. If it works in Genera buy not EW, I would guess that Genera does
some clever stuff in :size-from-contents that sees that the output is in
large font.

Okay, I dug around just a little on this.  The problem was my code for
the DRAW-HORIZONTALLY-CENTERED-STRING method.  It was calling
EW::DRAW-STRING without passing the :STREAM argument.  Okay, that seems
to solve the stream problem.

Now, however, when I specify 0 as the Y position of the stream for the
string to be printed, it is off the window.  I wonder if the Y position
is the bottom of the string for EW, and the top for DW, because
specifying 0 in DW yields the intended result.

That's the way draw-string works in CLIM too..  Perhaps the default value for
the &key param  #+genera :attachment-y #+clim :align-y  are different
(one of :center :top :bottom) ??

Just a guess,

Subject: Color in EW

Hello Fellow EW users,
	Some time ago there was a brief mention of using color
in EW.  The jist of the responses seemed to say that just by 
using the ":color" keyword to the various "draw-" type functions,
this would work.  Well, either I misinterpreted these claims, or
I am doing something wrong [imagine that!  ;-) ], because I cannot
get anything to draw in color on my Sun 3/280 with an RGB monitor
(Running Allegro CL 3.something, with the versions of PCL and CLX
that come with Allegro).
	What I would really like to be able to do is mix my
own color ALU's like I can do on my Symbolics.  Is this too 
ambitious?  Has anyone else got anything to draw in color under
EW?

	Thanks.

Well, I looked a bit, made a small change, and was able to draw a color polygon,
but didn't go any farther than that.

That was a couple weeks ago.. let's see if I remember the changes--
in graphics-primitives.lisp, most of the graphics functions contain a 

	      (xlib:with-gcontext (gcontext :FUNCTION (draw-alu alu)
					    :LINE-WIDTH thickness
				   ...
					))
wrapper around the xlib: graphics functions; I did the most simple thing and
just added a 				    
					    :COLOR color
line, and passed in a pixel value.
I witnessed an actual color polygon on my screen.

The color slot should also be added to the base presentation types, if you
want to see them redisplayed.

Yes.  The correct thing to do would probably be to define a (make-color r g b)
function, and pass this as an argument in for color.  These would have to be
allocated entries in the color map, and then decoded to pixel values for use
in the gcontext.  This would give you access to the full range of colors available.

I'm not sure what the Symbolics gives you for color.  Volume 7B shows
keywords for the eight rgb, cym & b/w colors.  It should be simple to map
keywords into the appropriate pixel value, like :black -> 1, etc, like
the function DRAW-ALU does in x-interface.lisp.

The mapping should also allow straight pixel values to be passed in
unchanged, for people who like to hack color maps themselves.


I was the person who originally asked about color.  I have a color monitor
now, but only temporarily in order to make a whizzy demo, then it goes away.
If I had had more time I think I might have tried implementing the color, but
instead I'm using CLIM now, only for the color.  It's still not as "mature"
as EW (yet) in many ways, but sufficient for this one-shot job.  If and when
time allows, I'd like to work on it.


Okay, there's even more explicit directions for adding color.. 
 who's going to implement?

Here's something I found which is helpful in EW on Allegro CL


;; From io-functions.lisp

#+excl
(eval-when (lisp:load lisp:eval)
  (defun fast-write-string (string &OPTIONAL output-stream start end)
    (setup-output-stream output-stream)
    (if (window-p output-stream)
	(presentation-print-string string output-stream start end)
	(excl-fast-write-string string output-stream start (or end (length string)))))

  (setf (symbol-function 'excl-fast-write-string) (symbol-function 'excl::fast-write-string))
  (setf (symbol-function 'excl::fast-write-string) (symbol-function 'fast-write-string)))

Subject: Framework classes, flavors, objects, etc..
To: express-windows@atc

Am I the only one confused by the lack of symmetry between DW and EW
objects and the naming of 'em?

For instance,

A DW:PROGRAM appears to be analagous to an EW:BASIC-FRAME-PROGRAM (at least
this is the type of object to which EW:*PROGRAM* is bound).  Although an
EW:PROGRAM-FRAME object appears to hold some of the corresponding that is
present in DW:PROGRAM.  More later on how to get the corresponding
EW:PROGRAM-FRAME object.

A DW:PROGRAM-FRAME appears to be roughly analagous to an
EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE (this is the type of object to which
EW::*PROGRAM-FRAME* is bound).

I'm not sure what the analagous object in DW is to EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.

In the ROOT-WINDOW slot of an EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE instance (e.g.,
EW:*PROGRAM-FRAME*) is an instance of EW:PROGRAM-FRAME (remember
EW:PROGRAM-FRAME from above).

In the PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE slot of an EW:PROGRAM-FRAME is an
instance of not EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE, but EW:BASIC-FRAME-PROGRAM,
of course.  Can you believe that!?  Yech!!  This must be one of those "it
is intuitively obvious to the casual reader ..." things.

Confused yet?  Do these names drive you batty?  They do me!

We have also found while a call to DW:FIND-PROGRAM-WINDOW returns an object
of type DW:PROGRAM-FRAME, the analagous call to EW:FIND-PROGRAM-WINDOW
returns an EW:BASIC-FRAME-PROGRAM instance, when it should return, if it
wanted to be analagous to DW, an instance of EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE.

So, here's a proposed INCOMPATIBLE change to FIND-PROGRAM-WINDOW (found in
ew/code/frames.lisp) which has it return the appropriate
EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE instance (got that!).  No other part of EW
references FIND-PROGRAM-WINDOW, so user calls (the important ones!) should
be the only affected ones.

(defun find-program-window (program-name &REST make-window-options &KEY (create-p T)
			    (activate-p t) (selected-ok T) reuse-test console
			    superior program-state-variables &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)
  (declare (ignore program-state-variables superior console reuse-test
	           selected-ok activate-p make-window-options)) ;4/30/90 (SLN)
  (let ((framework-definition (find-program-framework program-name)))
    (unless framework-definition
      (error "Framework ~A Does not Exist." program-name))
    (let ((instances (program-framework-program-instances framework-definition)))
      (cond (instances  ; 7/10/90 [SLN] - return the EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE
	     (program-frame (first instances)))
	    (create-p  ; 7/10/90 [SLN] - return the EW:PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK-INSTANCE 
	     (program-frame (create-program-framework-instance framework-definition)))
	    (T NIL)))))

Okay, so my comments are a little sarcastic and all.  It's just that
sometimes it gets a little frustrating working with EW.  Comments?  Other
observations?

Subject: Express Windows with AKCL
Reply-To: gadbois%adler.philosophie.uni-stuttgart.de@RELAY.CS.NET


I have gotten the required parts of EW to compile under AKCL 1-478
with May Day PCL and CLX R4.3.  I have reached the point where I can
get the main screen to come up, though that is about it.  When I run
the lisp-window program, I don't get any response from the keywoard.

Before I go diving into the code, has anyone out there had any success
with the configuration?

Here are some of the changes I had to make in order to get EW to
compile with AKCL and the version of CLX I have:

o Install the patches for May Day PCL that have appeared on this list.
  (Thanks Stephen! The patches saved me a lot of work.)

o In macros.lsp, there are a number of redundant structure
  type predicate macros that cause AKCL to barf.  Comment them out.
  Also, AKCL can't handle structure field type declarations of the
  form (FIXNUM 0 15);  I had to change these to just FIXNUM.

o In clx-hacks.lsp, there are references to undefined functions
  XLIB::DECLARE-VALUES and XLIB::DECLARE-FUNARG.  I suppose that these
  are from an earlier version of CLX.  I removed the references
  without any apparent harm.

o There is a mysterious bug in the AKCL reader that sometimes causes
  it to get an undefined dispatching macro error when it sees things
  like #P"foo" in comments.  You may have to remove these.

o The names of characters in AKCL are completely different than in
  other Lisps.  Here is a list:

	EW		AKCL
	=====================
	Rubout		 
	Meta-Rubout	 \377
	Control-A	 
	Control-Shift-a	 
	Control-B	 
	Meta-B		 \342
	Meta-Control-B	 \202
	Meta-C		 \343
	Control-D	 
	Meta-D		 \344
	Control-E	 
	Control-F	 
	Meta-F		 \346
	Meta-Control-F	 \206
	Control-K	 
	Control-L	 
	Meta-L		 \354
	Control-N	 
	Control-O	 
	Control-P	 
	Control-T	 
	Meta-T		 \364
	Meta-Control-T	 \224
	Meta-U		 \365
	Control-V	 
	Meta-V		 \366
	Control-Meta-W	 \227
	Control-Y	 
	Meta-Y		 \371
	Meta-Control-Y	 \231
	Meta-Control-Z	 \232
	control-?	 ?
	Meta-K		 \353
	Meta-Control->	 \276
	Meta-Control-<	 \274
	Meta->		 \276
	Meta-<		 \274
	Meta-Control-?	 \277

  Note that some characters are not distinct, so you'll have to
  reassign the key mappings in command-processor.lsp to suit your
  tastes.

o There were a number of references to a #\CR character.  I replaced
  them with #\Newline characters.

o In AKCL, byte specs are not self-evaluating (in fact, they are just
  dotted conses) so you have to quote the read time reference to one
  in read-internal.lsp.

o PCL under AKCL is excruciatingly slow.  Some of the EW files with
  big DEFCLASSes in them took over an hour to compile and another hour
  to load on a Sun 3.  Does anyone know how to speed this up?  I ended
  up splitting the files macros.lsp and x-macros-interface.lsp into a
  number of pieces to make things bearable.

Hope this helps,

Subject: New Version of Express Windows
To: express-windows@atc

I'm a little hesitant to do this, lest I become known as the "maintainer"
of Express Windows (which I'm not), but here goes anyway ...

Announcing the availability of a new version of Express Windows.  There are
two reasons for wanting to release this new version.  The first is to unify
bug fixes and other suggestions which have appeared on this list.  The
second is to encourage further enhancements through other user submissions.
This release should help in establishing a baseline from which other
modifications can evolve.

This version, which is dubbed the "Goodwill" version of Express Windows,
represents the version currently in use at The Boeing Company.  However,
neither Boeing nor I accept responsibility to anyone for the consequences
of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or works at
all.  There is no express or implied warranty.  Neither does the release of
this version consitute endorsement of Express Windows by The Boeing
Company.

Some of the features of Goodwill EW are:

 - Should work with Victoria, Rainy and May Day PCL and Symbolics CLOS.

 - Should work with CLX R3 & R4.3.

 - Compiled and cursorily tested in 
    - Sun/Lucid Common Lisp 3.0.2 (Sun 3, SunOS 4.1)
    - Franz Allegro Common Lisp 3.1.13 (Sun 3, SunOS 4.1)
    - Symbolics Common Lisp (Symbolics 3650, Genera 8.0)

 - Numerous (too numerous to list) bugs and compilation warning messages
   from the original version have been handled. [Note: not all of 'em have
   been handled, though.  If you know how to handle the remaining ones, let
   us know.]

 - CLX and PCL are not distributed with Goodwill EW.

Goodwill Express Windows can be FTPed (user: anonymous, password: <your
email address>) from atc.boeing.com (IP address [130.42.28.80]).  In the
/pub/ew/ directory is the file express-windows.goodwill.tar.Z.  This is a
compressed tar file containing Goodwill Express Windows.  Also in that
directory is express-windows.original.tar.Z, which is the original version
of Express Windows.  Consult the COPYING file in that directory for license
agreement information.  Consult the READ_ME.GOODWILL file in that directory
for more information.

Our Lisp environments are probably not quite the same as other users.  We
are working primarily with Symbolics Genera 8.0, Lucid Common Lisp 3.0.2,
and Franz' Allegro Common Lisp 3.1.13.  Additionally, we are using May Day
PCL in Lucid and Allegro, Symbolics' native CLOS, and CLX R4.3.  

While no deliberate attempt has been made by us to drop support in EW for
any CL, CLOS, or CLX implementation, we haven't tried, either, to insure
compatibility with any version other than those listed above.  Goodwill EW
should work in non-May Day versions of PCL and in CLX R3.  We have, no
doubt, inadvertantly missed some things.  I urge you to let everyone know
of any incompatibilities you discover by sending a note to
express-windows@atc.boeing.com.  Likewise, any other enhancements,
suggestions, questions, comments, et al, should be directed to
express-windows@atc.boeing.com.

This is the first time I've ever been involved in the Internet-wide
distribution of a system.  I expect that this initial release will reveal
configuration / installation problems that I have overlooked.  As a result,
this release should probably be dubbed "BETA".  Once any initial
difficulties are handled, a "RELEASED" Goodwill version will be posted (if
necessary; I'm crossing my fingers :-).

One final note.  I make no promises that there will ever be another release
of EW by me or anyone at Boeing beyond this Goodwill version.  My primary
duties at Boeing do not involve supporting EW.  Enough said.

I hope everyone finds this release useful and will decide to contribute
their enhancements for all to use.

Good Luck,

Steve

is it possible to write something (a number) at the same place every time 
without having to remember the coordinates?

I managed to narrow the problem to the following function: streamp

(defpackage ew (:shadow lisp:streamp))

(in-package :ew)

(defun streamp (object)
  (or (lisp:typep object 'window)

(defun setup-lisp-functions (&OPTIONAL (functions '(lisp:streamp)))
  (dolist (function functions)

	  (cl-function function))
      (unless (fboundp local-name)
	(setf (symbol-function local-name) (symbol-function cl-function)))
      (when (fboundp new-function)
	(setf (symbol-function cl-function) (symbol-function new-function))))))

If you then do:
(ew::setup-lisp-functions)
You get:

Nasty recursive error in debugger.

Reply-To: Jean-Francois Rit <rit@killdeer.stanford.edu>


I have a problem with launching Express-windows on a DECstation 3100 Running
Franz ACL 3.1, and UWS 2.2. 

In short, a (xlib:font-ascent some-font-object) causes a name-error, while
other slots like xlib:font-name are accessed without problem. When I open
another display in the same environment and open new fonts, the bug
disappears. I am afraid this is a situation where the Allegro and
Express-windows will throw the ball at each other. Anyway, any kind of
indication on what to investigate next would be useful.

    Is there any other documentation apart the source code?

    Francois-Xavier

Symbolics' manuals on Dynamics Windows and User Interfaces is
probably the best documentation of what EW is supposed to be
like.  Apart from that, there should be a "doc" subdirectory
distributed with EW with some documentation.

Subject: Alu problem
Reply-To: Jean-Francois Rit <rit@killdeer.stanford.edu>


I have some problem with alu values. I am running Allegro 3.1 on a
DECstation3100, UWS 2.2.

First my query: can somebody who has xlib:screen-black-pixel to 0 and
displaying working properly give me the values of its xlib boolean
constants?(You just have to eval the following forms and give me the result:

(XLIB:SCREEN-BLACK-PIXEL (xlib:display-default-screen ew::*X-DISPLAY*))
(dolist (x '(boole-1 boole-2 boole-andc1 boole-andc2 boole-and boole-c2
		     boole-clr boole-eqv boole-ior boole-nand
		     boole-nor boole-orc1 boole-orc2 boole-set boole-xor))  
	(format t "~% ~a ~s" x (eval x)))


Now the bug description:

Alu values are set in this function (in x-interface.lisp):

(defun init-alu-values (black-color)
  (ecase black-color
    #+excl
    ((255 1) (setq *Draw-Alu-Value* 7
	     *Erase-Alu-Value* 0
	     *Flip-Alu-Value* 8
	     *Magic-Alu-Value* 2))
    #-excl
    ((255 1) (setq *Draw-Alu-Value* 7
	     *Erase-Alu-Value* 2
	     *Flip-Alu-Value* 6
	     *Magic-Alu-Value* 5))
    (0 (setq *Draw-Alu-Value* 1
	     *Erase-Alu-Value* 15
	     *Flip-Alu-Value* 9
	     *Magic-Alu-Value* 10))))

I fall in the last case because my xlib:screen-black-pixel is 0.

The behavior I get in the Lisp Interactor is: 

When I try to type sys (space) me (space) I get:

The first s is not echoed (it should echo a S)
then ys is echoed
then tem is echoed, The S appears in inverse video, and ys is overwritten by a
black blob.
then men is echoed normally, 
then, no more echo but the system menu appears.

In the system menu, menu items appear as a black bar when the mouse is over
them. In the Lisp Window, previous commands are higlighted correctly when the
mouse is over.


I've tried the other (255 1) cases, they are much worse (nothing appears in
the mouse panel and the system menu).

I hope that by getting the boolean xlib values from a working implementation,
I can translate them to correct integer values, hence my query. Is there a
reason why this is not done directly in the code?

Right now, these values are for me:
 *Draw-Alu-Value* 1	SET
 *Erase-Alu-Value* 15	ORC2
 *Flip-Alu-Value* 9	EQV
 *Magic-Alu-Value* 10	NAND

Reply-To: Jean-Francois Rit <rit@killdeer.stanford.edu>


This problem has been solved.

The cause is that there is no -bitstream-charter font family in UWS 2.2. 
The fix is a neutralization of the (:charter ... form in (setq *Font-Table*
... in fonts.lisp. I used #-:dec3100 (which is not completely satisfactory,
apparently, there is no feature for discriminating the MIT X server from the
DEC one),

I couldn't find this (trivial) error because of my illiteracy in X, thanks to
Franz Inc. support for suggesting it and giving the advice function to
pinpoint it which I reproduce here: 

(setq fns (xlib:list-font-names *x-display* "*"))
(advise xlib:open-font :before :check-name nil
  (let ((name (second arglist)))
    (unless (member name fns :test #'string-equal)
      (error "Bad font name ~a." name))))

I have found a fix for the problem reported bellow:

Just swap the call to typep and lisp-streamp in streamp like this:

(defun streamp (object)
  (or (lisp-streamp object)
       (lisp:typep object 'window)))

Subject: Lisp break with goodwill EW


Goodwill EW compiled on my Symbolics running Genera 8.0 without a hitch. However,
I encountered the following break while I started running it.

In order to see at least one EW window show up on either my SUN3 
(running X), I did the following:

a)  Added the Symbolics to the X-server's access control list via the xhost command.

b)  On the Lisp machine, I did the following:

	> (in-package 'ew)

	> (setf ew::*Default-Host* "spike")         ;; that's the name of my Sun  (the X server)
	
	> (clear-all)

	> (initialize-window-system)

	;; No root window appeared.  Any ideas why?
	;; In order to run the demos in demos.lisp, should one use (run-program 'demo)?

	> (run-program 'lisp-window)

whereupon I got the following break

Thanks for any input.

  I grabbed a copy of the Goodwill version of EW yesterday and
I'm having a problem compiling it. When (compile-ew) gets done
compiling code/io-functions and loads it, my lisp hangs waiting
for input. This is caused by the (setup-lisp-functions) call. Has
anyone else run across this? Any fixes?  I'm running Allegro
Common Lisp 3.1.13 on a Sun3.

I've think I've run into this before.  I had similar symptons
with EW not being configured correctly for the version of PCL
being used.  Which version of PCL are you using?  The Victoria
Day one provided with Allegro?  or maybe Rainy or May Day PCL?

Also, what's the value of *features*?

	      I grabbed a copy of the Goodwill version of EW
	    yesterday and I'm having a problem compiling it. When
	    (compile-ew) gets done compiling code/io-functions and
	    loads it, my lisp hangs waiting for input. This is caused
	    by the (setup-lisp-functions) call. Has anyone else run
	    across this? Any fixes?  I'm running Allegro Common Lisp
	    3.1.13 on a Sun3.

	I've think I've run into this before.  I had similar symptons
	with EW not being configured correctly for the version of PCL
	being used.  Which version of PCL are you using?  The
	Victoria Day one provided with Allegro?  or maybe Rainy or
	May Day PCL?

	Also, what's the value of *features*?

      I'm using the Victoria Day pcl that comes with Allegro. My
    *features* list looks like this after loading code/require: 

    (:X :DEFPACKAGE :EW-CLOS :PCL-VICTORIA :PCL :CLOS :CLX-MIT-R4
     :XLIB :CLX :MULTIPROCESSING :LOOP LOOP :UNIX :SUN3 :M68K :SUN
     :SUNOS4.0 :FLAVORS :IEEE :CONFORMING-IEEE :COMMON-LISP :ALLEGRO
     :EXCL :FRANZ-INC :ALLEGRO-V3.1 :M68020 :M68881 :GSGC
     :BIG-ENDIAN)

      In the file require.lisp, it states that if you're using Franz,
    you can use (require :pcl) instead of the larger form. I believe
    that this is in error.  You must put the (require :pcl) before
    that form. If you don't include that form, the pcl package will
    not be given a nickname of ew-clos nor will one of the
    :pcl-<version> keywords be added to *features*.

You're correct about this error.  Thanks for pointing it out.
Your suggestion of putting "(require :pcl)" prior to the larger
form should handle the error well.  Probably adding "#+excl
(require :pcl)" would be best.

Assuming that you already made this fix and are still having the
problem, I'm afraid I don't know what the problem is.  I just
recompiled EW from a lisp image which already had pcl and clx in
it, and the recompilation went well.

        Were you ever able to overcome this bug?  If so, what was the
        solution? 

        Steve

      Yes, I was finally able to get it to work. This time I too used a
    lisp with PCL and a clossified version of CLX already loaded. I also
    removed all of the binaries that I had already compiled.

      By the way, is there any easy way to make the initial lisp window
    smaller?  The default is wider than my screen and almost as high. Right
    now, I'm just doing (run-program 'lisp-window) to start things up.

I'd sure like to do this as well.  I'm not even able to resize the window
under the window manager I'm using (twm).  If you or someone else can
figure it out, let us all know.

the simple (if not proper) way to do this is to hack initialize-window-system.
the following code allows the dimensions to be specified as keyword args. the
mouse doc window will be sized proportionately.

;;; from x-interface.lisp
;;;
(defun initialize-window-system (&OPTIONAL (host *Default-Host*) &KEY protocol (display 0)
				 	   (width (xlib:screen-width *screen*))
				 	   (height (xlib:screen-height *screen*)))
  (setq *Menu-Choose-Resource* NIL
	*mouse-window* NIL)
  (when *X-Display*
    ;; remove pixmaps from stipples so they can be GC'd.
    (dolist (stipple *stipple-arrays*)
      (setf (stipple-pattern-pixmaps stipple)
	    (delete (xlib:screen-root *screen*)
		    (stipple-pattern-pixmaps stipple)
		    :KEY #'FIRST)))
    (xlib:close-display *X-display*))
  (setq *X-Display* (xlib:open-display host :DISPLAY display :PROTOCOL protocol)
	*Screen*  (xlib:display-default-screen *X-Display*))
  (init-alu-values (xlib:screen-black-pixel *Screen*))
  (xfonts::init-fonts)
  (let ((screen-width width)
	(screen-height height)
	(mouse-documentation-window-height 36))
    (setq *Ultimate-Root-Window*
       . . .

There were a few bugs in the definition of with-compilation-unit in
ew/code/defsystem.lisp.  I think the appended replacement code should work
okay.

I am working on an automatic scheduling system for the Hubble Space
Telescope.  We have Suns and Explorerers here and I am interested
in Express Windows as a portable window system for those platforms.
Has EW been ported to Explorers - if not how difficult
might it be to do the port. The Explorer supports a robust
CLX.

Express Windows does not have its own user manual per se.  Refer to a
Symbolics Dynamic Windows manual since Express Windows is designed to
support Dynamic Windows functionality in Lucid and Franz Allegro Lisp
(using CLX).

What little other documentation exists for Express Windows can be found
(using anonymous ftp) on atc.boeing.com in files in the /pub/ew/ directory.

Subject: ew on DECstation 5000, Lucid 4.0


Has anyone gotten ew to work on a DECstation 5000, Lucid 4.0, Ultrix
4.0?  My first couple of attempts have failed during the compilation
of ew.  The following were part of the lisp image when I tried this:
WTK & CLOS (which also means CLX).  When I attempt the load of
load-ew.lisp it asks if I want to load CLX and CLOS and I say no
because they are already loaded.  I am not sure what version of CLOS
or CLX is part of Lucid 4.0 the old pcl::*pcl-system-date* is not
there anymore.  Anyway, I guess I should describe in more detail what
happened but, first, I would like to know if someone has successfully
ported ew to the 5000 using Lucid 4.0.  Thanx.

    I am currently in the throws of implementing a window-based
debugger interface for Lucid (Sun) Common Lisp on top of express
windows.  (For those who don't already know, express windows does
not mix well with debuggers...)

    I have managed to achieve most of what I want to do, but
there is one last nagging problem;  how do I make the ":A"
(abort) command stop throwing all the way to the lisp top level?
(My applictation also has its own top level function, to which I
would like to return after errors.)  I have tried catching
throws to system:top-level, but this does not work.

    Could anyone (especially anyone at lucid...) throw me a useful
hint?

    Never mind!  I figured it out.  For some reason, it never occurred
to me that a commercial CL debugger might actually make use of conditions
and restarts.

    My appologies for the waste of net bandwidth!

Subject: EW List status

To: EW List recipients

It's been almost a year since any substantive messages have appeared
on the Express Windows mailing list (express-windows@boeing.com).

Because of that and other commitments on my part, I intend to close
down the list on boeing.com on September 1st.

Additionally, on the same date the original and Goodwill versions of
Express Windows will be removed from the /pub/ew directory on
atc.boeing.com [130.42.28.80].

If you are interested in picking up the task of administering the
list, and/or if you know of a site that would be willing to pick a copy of
EW code, please contact me at stephen@boeing.com.

Subject: Express Windows Administration Change
Cc: mkant@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

The Express Windows mailing list and anonymous ftp site have changed from
The Boeing Company to Carnegie Mellon University. Both the original and
Goodwill versions of Express Windows may now be found as part of the
Common Lisp Utilities Collection, in the ew/ subdirectory of the
directory
	/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mkant/Public/Lisp-Utilities/
For access by anonymous ftp, ftp to any CMU CS machine (e.g., A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU
[128.2.242.7]) and cd to the directory. Note that the CMU ftp daemon
restricts access to intermediate directories, so one must cd to the
Lisp-Utilities directory in one fell swoop. Of course, if your site is
running the Andrew File System, you should be able to cd to this
directory directly without using ftp.

The mailing list has also changed, and is now
	express-windows@cs.cmu.edu
An archive of mail sent to the list may be found in ew/mail-archive.text.
Administrative requests (e.g., to be added to or removed from the mailing
list) should be directed to
	express-windows-request@cs.cmu.edu
Please note that although I am administrating the list and ftp site, I am
not maintaining the software. Bug reports and fixes should be sent to the
mailing list, not to me.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send mail to 
express-windows-request@cs.cmu.edu.

Has anyone been able to get express windows to work on lucid 4.0.2 on
Sparc SunOS 4.1.  If so, what changes (if any) need to be made to the
latest release?

Has anyone started to modify EW to be more like CLIM?

Subject: Express Windows (Poor Man's CLIM?) and CMUCL 16f


Hello,

I downloaded EW from the lisp repository and I am trying to make it
run under CMUCL v16f.

I have a couple of questions about the package (I hope who wrote the
original package is still around to answer).

1) Has anybody tried to to the same (i.e. loading EW under CMUCL)
   before?

2) Why one must redefine the i/o functions (e.g. lisp:format ==>
   ew:lisp-format): the original functions are shadowed in the
   packages defined by EW, so I do not see the need for such
   redefinition (which seems to be the cause of CMUCL barfing on the
   file 'io-functions').

3) Under CMUCL it should be possible to use the function
   'system::serve-event' for X related code. Has anybody any
   suggestion on its use?

Thanks in advance
