This file describes the steps to configure for compilation,
compile and load Express Windows.

To configure Express Windows for compilation:

  - [Non Lisp Machine Implementations] Edit the file
    ./code/defsystem.lisp  

    - Change the values of the following Global variables to
      reflect the location of the appropriate files:

      *EW-TOP-LEVEL-DIRECTORY*
      *EW-SOURCE-CODE-DIRECTORY*
      *EW-BINARY-CODE-DIRECTORY*

      [Note: It is useful to make the value for
      *EW-BINARY-CODE-DIRECTORY* dependent on the Common Lisp
      implementation and release.  This allows for compiling
      identical EW source files in one releases of the same
      implementation of Common Lisp at the same site, without
      fear of overwriting another release's compiled EW files.
      The default form evaluated for the default value of this
      variable shows a useful technique for implementing this
      scheme.  If you are using different CLOS implementations
      in the same CL implementation, you may want to add an
      additional dependecy based on the CLOS implementation.]

  - [Lisp Machine Implementations Only] Edit the files
    ./code/ew.system & ./code/ew.translations to reflect the
    location of the appropriate files and then move these files
    to your site directory (SYS:SITE;).

  - Edit the file ./code/require.lisp

    - Change the file as necessary to insure that the systems
      listed (LOOP, CLX, CLOS & DEFPACKAGE) are loaded at the
      appropriate times by the appropriate implementations.
      Consult the comments in the file for more detailed
      instructions on which forms to modify.

      [Note: this file only loads the necessary systems, it does
      not compile those systems (except for DEFPACKAGE).]


To Compile Express Windows:

  - Non Symbolics Users:

    - Load the DEFSYSTEM file

      For example,

        Evaluate the following form:

        > (load "ew/code/defsystem")

      or, alternatively, in Franz Allegro CL

        <cl> :ld ew/code/defsystem

    - Evaluate the following form:

      > (user::compile-ew)

      optionally providing values for the :RECOMPILE & :VERBOSE
      keywords.

  - Symbolics Users:

    - Issue the Compile System Command.

      Command: Compile System EW


To Load Express Windows: [Note: if you are still using the Lisp
session during which you compiled EW, you may skip this step
since the compilation process loads all of the code.]

  - Non Symbolics Users:

    - Load the DEFSYSTEM file

      For example,

        Evaluate the following form:

        > (load "ew/code/defsystem")

      or, alternatively, in Franz Allegro CL

        <cl> :ld ew/code/defsystem

    - Evaluate the following form:

      > (user::load-ew)

  - Symbolics Users:

    - Issue the Load System Command.

      Command: Load System EW

In the directory ./scripts/ are files showing what a compilation
session of Express Windows appeared like in Lucid, Franz'
Allegro, and Symbolics Common Lisp.  This should be useful for
tracking any problems with respect to compilation/installation.
