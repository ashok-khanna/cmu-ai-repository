   BOOK DESCRIPTION

   In this greatly expanded edition of the defacto standard, you'll learn
   about the nearly 200 changes already made since original publication -
   and find out about gray areas likely to be revised later.  Written by
   the Vice-Chairman of X3J13 (the ANSI committee responsible for the
   standardization of Common Lisp) and co-developer of the language
   itself, the new edition contains the entire text of the first edition
   plus six completely new chapters.  They cover:

   *       CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, with new features to
	   support function overloading and object-oriented programming, plus
	   complete technical specifications
   *       Loops, a powerful control structure for multiple variables
   *       Conditions, a generalization of the error signaling mechanism
   *       Series and generators
   *       Plus other subjects not part of the ANSI standards but of
	   interest to professional programmers.  Throughout, you'll find 
	   fresh examples, additional clarifications, warnings, and tips - 
	   all presented with the author's customary vigor and wit.
