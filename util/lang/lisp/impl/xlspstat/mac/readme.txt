Disk 1 of this distribution includes a version of XLISP-STAT for Macs with
a coprocessor. To use XLISP-STAT on a Mac without a coprocessor (Plus, SE
or Portable, e.g.) use the generic XLISP-STAT application from Disk 2.

All other files from Disk 1 must be in the same folder as the application
you choose for XLISP-STAT to work properly. In addition, you can place one
of the two help files from Disk 2 in this folder. The small help file only
contains help information for the most important functions and messages; it
loads a little faster than the full help file.

The file xlsx.h on DIsk 2 is a header file for use with external functions.
