This note is to announce the availability of Version 2.1 of
XLISP-STAT, an extensible system for statistical computing and dynamic
graphics.

XLISP-STAT is based on a dialect of Lisp called XLISP. It is available
for the Apple Macintosh, for workstations running the X11 window
system under BSD UNIX (and perhaps System V with BSD enhancements),
and for Sun workstations running SunView. A version for the Commodore
Amiga is available as well.

The system is based on David Betz' XLISP 2.1, which is written in C.
To facilitate statistical computations I have modified standard Lisp
functions for addition, logarithms, etc., to operate on lists and
arrays of numbers, and have also added a number of basic statistical
functions. About two thirds of the additions are written in C; the
rest are written in Lisp. Several basic forms of plots, including
histograms, scatterplots, 3-dimensional rotatable plots and
scatterplot matrices are provided.  These plots support various forms
of interactive highlighting operations and can be linked so points
highlighted in one plot will be highlighted in all linked plots.
Interactions with the plots are controlled by the mouse, menus and
dialog boxes. An object-oriented programming system is used to make it
possible to customize menus, dialogs, and the way plots respond to
mouse actions.

The UNIX version, which can be compiled without graphics, for X11
graphics, or for SunView graphics, is available by anonymous ftp from

	umnstat.stat.umn.edu (128.101.51.1)

It is in the file xlispstat2.1R1.tar.Z in the directory pub/xlispstat.
(The version and release numbers will be updated as changes are
made/bugs are fixed).  This system has been compiled on a VAX, DEC
3100 (pmax), Sun 3, Encore Multimax and Apollo 4500.

The Macintosh version is also available by anonymous ftp from the
address given above. The Macintosh distribution consists of two parts,
contained in the files

	XLISP-STAT2.1R1.Disk1.sit.Hqx
	XLISP-STAT2.1R1.Disk2.sit.Hqx

in the directory puxlispstat. These files contain archives created
with StuffIt 1.5.1 that have been binhexed with BinHex 4.0. The
Macintosh distribution includes two versions of the system, one foe
macs with a math coprocessor and one for generic macs.

For reasonable operation the Mac version requires 2MB of memory. It
may be possible to use it on very small problems with only 1MB. The
program is fairly slow on a Mac Plus or SE.

A tutorial introduction to the system is available. It is written
primarily for the Macintosh version, but the differences to the UNIX
version are minor. The tutorial is available as a set of LaTeX files
in xlispstat.doc.tar.Z in the pub directory at the ftp address above.

More complete documentation will be published as a book that should be
available from WIley in October. The title of the book is "Lisp-Stat:
An object-oriented environment for statistical computing and dynamic
graphics."
