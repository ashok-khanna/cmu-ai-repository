Source code for building the MS Windows version of XLISP-STAT with
Borland C++ is provided as a modification to the UNIX sources
available from umnstat or statlib.  On umnstat the MS Windows sources
are available as a compressed tar file, msdos_src.tar.Z.

To get the full sources

	Get the UNIX sources form umnstat or statlib.

	Apply the unix.patches file using the `patch' program. This makes
	some modifications that will eventually be included in the
	UNIX 2.1R3 version, whenever that is released.

	Look at the file `MSFILES'. This lists all the files from the UNIX
	distribution you will need. Some need to be renamed as
	specified in the second columnto meet the DOS file name
	limits. Add these files to the new files in this directory and
	transfer them to your DOS source directory.

That should do it. I have not actually done the transfer this way yet, so
I may have missed a file or two somewhere. If so, please let me know and I
will patch up the distribution.
