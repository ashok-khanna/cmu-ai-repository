Description: 

   ECoLisp (ECL, Eco Common Lisp) is a Common Lisp implementation which
   compiles Lisp functions into C functions that use the C stack and
   standard procedure call conventions. This lets Lisp and C code be
   easily mixed. It is designed to be used as a C library from any C
   application. ECL also includes MTCL, a multithread facility, and CLOS.

   This is an alpha release.

   The sources are in ecl.tar.gz. The compiler requires that the file
   dcl.h be present under /usr/local/include/.

Requires:     

Ports:        Sun workstations (SunOS 4.x), SGI (IRIX 4.x), and IBM PC
              (DOS/go32).
