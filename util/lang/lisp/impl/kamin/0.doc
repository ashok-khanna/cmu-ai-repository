Summary:      C and C++ Implementations of the Kamin Interpreters

Description:

   This directory contains the source code for the interpreters from
   Sam Kamin's book,
      Samuel Kamin, "Programming Languages, An Interpreter-Based Approach", 
      Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1990. ISBN 0-201-06824-9.
   as well as Tim Budd's re-implementation in C++. The book discusses
   interpreters for Pascal, Lisp, APL, Scheme, SASL, CLU, Smalltalk
   and Prolog. The implementations center around a common core that
   remains unchanged from language to language. 
   
   Tim Budd's implementation represents a complete rewrite,
   not a translation of Kamin's Pascal versions.
