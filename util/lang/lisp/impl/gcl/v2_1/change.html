	* There have been an infinite number of changes for gcl-2.0

	* GCL now contains a tcl/tk windowing interface.
	 It is based on TCL 7.3 and TK 3.6 available from
	 ftp.cs.berkeley.edu and many mirrors.

	 See the gcl-tk/demos/widget.lisp file for the demos.
	 

	* support for gzipped files
	(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)
	to allow it.   (load "foo.o") will look for "foo.o.gz" if
	it does not find foo.o.   Writing gzipped files is not
	supported.

	* Command line args:
	See the documentaion in the info directory under command line.
	`-eval' `-load' etc.
	
	`-f'   allows shell scripts to be made such as
	==================
	#!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
	(print "hello world")
	==================

	* All documentation converted to texinfo, info format and
	extended.   Ansi common lisp documentation converted to texinfo

	* interrupts completely changed, to be more robust and to
	allow communication with tk.

	* regexp matching introduced see 'string-match'
