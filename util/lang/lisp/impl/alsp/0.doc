Version:      1.0 (17-MAR-86)

Description: 

   ALSP is a package of types, objects, and functions that emulate the
   important capabilities of Lisp which are not directly available in
   Ada. These capabilities are represented in Ada in a relatively
   straightforward manner without changing the Ada language definition.
