Subject: LISP in awk(1)
Keywords: Lisp, awk

    A few weeks ago I mentioned I'd written a Lisp interpreter in Awk.
I received many requests for a copy, and as it's quite small I am posting
it for your amusement.  Some auxiliary files and documentation are included.

    I'm absurdly proud of this little thing, so kindly leave my name on
it somewhere in the event that you rewrite and redistribute it as Scheme
in Awk (squawk?) or some such thing.  Otherwise, feel free to hack on it.
