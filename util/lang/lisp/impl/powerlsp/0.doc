Summary:      Shareware Common Lisp for the Macintosh

Version:      1.10 () ; 1.01 (6-SEP-93)

Description: 

   PowerLisp is a Common Lisp development environment for the Macintosh.
   It consists of a Common Lisp interpreter, native-code 680x0 compiler,
   680x0 macro assembler, disassembler, incremental linker and
   multi-window text editor. 

   PowerLisp has the ability to run in the background. While executing a
   Common Lisp program, the user may switch to another application as it
   continues to run. You can also edit programs while a Common Lisp
   program is running.

   PowerLisp is targeted to be compatible with CTLTL2 without CLOS
   (for now) but some Common Lisp functions are not yet implemented.
   Upcoming versions should include the remaining language features.

   Documentation in Word and MacWrite format and sample programs/source
   included.
