Summary:      Information about Pearl Lisp

Version:      

Description: 

   When Apple Computer acquired Coral Software in January 1989, they
   re-released Coral's Allegro Common Lisp and its optional modules as
   Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp (now just Macintosh Common Lisp).
   Coral's other product, Pearl Lisp, was discontinued at that time.
   Pearl Lisp provides a subset of the functionality of MACL 1.3 and is
   not even fully CLtL1-compatible (e.g., the implementation of defstruct is
   different).

   Despite rumors to the contrary, Pearl Lisp is not and never was public
   domain. Nevertheless, Pearl Lisp and its documentation were placed in
   the "Moof:Goodies:Pearl Lisp" folder on the first pressing of "Phil
   and Dave's Excellent CD", the precursor to the current Apple
   Developer's CD-ROM series.  Apple removed Pearl from later versions of
   the developer CD-ROM distribution because of complaints from other
   Lisp vendors. If you own a copy of Pearl Lisp or a copy of this
   CD-ROM, you can make it runnable under System 7 with some slight
   modifications using ResEdit.  To repeat, Pearl Lisp is NOT public
   domain, so you must own a copy to use it.

   To make it runnable, one needs to use ResEdit to make changes to the
   BNDL and FREF resources so that it will connect to its icons properly.
   This will make it respond to double-clicks in the normal manner and
   make it be properly linked to its files.

   Detailed instructions for modifying Pearl Lisp using ResEdit 
   are included in this directory.
             
   After you've made the changes, it will run under System 7 on 68000s
   and 68030s if you turn off 32-bit addressing. It seems to bomb on a
   Quadra.      
             
   If you need a more powerful Lisp or one that is compatible with the
   standard for Common Lisp, consider purchasing Macintosh Common Lisp.
