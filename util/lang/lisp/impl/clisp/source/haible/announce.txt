Change log since 22 June 1994:

4 July 1994
===========

User visible changes
--------------------

* X3J13 votes <115> and <114> are implemented: an elaborate LOOP macro.
  New macro LOOP-FINISH.
  Warning: The scoping rules for the iteration variables are hairy. If a
  FOR/AS initialisation form refers to an iteration variable of a subsequent
  FOR/AS clause, the effects are implementation dependent!

* X3J13 vote <120> is implemented: New function MAP-INTO.

* X3J13 vote <79> is implemented: New constants
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-SHORT-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-SHORT-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-SINGLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-SINGLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-DOUBLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-DOUBLE-FLOAT,
  LEAST-POSITIVE-NORMALIZED-LONG-FLOAT,
  LEAST-NEGATIVE-NORMALIZED-LONG-FLOAT.

* The macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-PRINTER now also works on DOS.

* Fixed a bug in DO-SYMBOLS: A symbol which is exported from a used package
  was considered accessible in the using package even if it was shadowed by
  another present symbol of the same name.

* Fixed a bug in the debugger which caused the BACKTRACE commands to print
  garbage if the current user interface language was not english.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.
