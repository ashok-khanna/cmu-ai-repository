Name:         CLISP

Summary:      Common Lisp implementation from Germany

Version:      1993-11-08

Description: 

   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) implementation by
   Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich
   University, both in Germany. It runs on microcomputers as well as
   on Unix workstations and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM.  

   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler, a subset of CLOS and, for some
   machines, a screen editor. Packages running in CLISP include PCL and,
   on Unix machines, CLX and Garnet.  

   The structure of the distribution is as follows:
      source/            source of CLISP
      binaries/          binaries for several platforms
      packages/          application packages ported to CLISP:
                            PCL (another CLOS subset), CLX, Garnet, and Maxima.
      mail/              archives of the mailing list
      sybase/            the Sybase SQL interface

   The Sybase SQL interface for CLIPS is available by anonymous ftp from
      wuarchive.wustl.edu:packages/clips2sybase/
   For more information on the SQL interface, write to Sherry Steib
   <sherry@informatics.wustl.edu>.
