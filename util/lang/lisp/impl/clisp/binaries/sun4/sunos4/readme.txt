CLISP - a Common Lisp implementation
Copyright (c) Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll, 1992, 1993

There is a German and an English version.

This is known to run on SunOS 4.1.1.

From the 1993-03-28 version on, no temporary memory image file on disk
is needed. This should reduce disk access. Please inform me if it
introduces other limitations.
