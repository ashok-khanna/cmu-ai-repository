Summary:      Information about Macintosh Common Lisp 

Version:      2.0

Description: 

   Macintosh Common Lisp is a commercial Common Lisp implementation for
   the Apple Macintosh.  It includes a native CLOS, Macintosh
   Toolbox/interface toolkit, ephemeral garbage collection, incremental
   compiler, window-based debugger, source-code stepper, object
   inspector, emacs-style editor, and a foreign function interface.

   With MCL version 2.0, Apple has started distributing a CD-ROM which
   contains, among other things, a large collection of Lisp code,
   complete MCL manuals in an online-browser format, the CLIM 1.0 manual
   in TeX and postscript, and copies of Gambit 1.8 Scheme, SIOD 2.8
   Scheme, Pixie Scheme, and a demo version of MacScheme.

   MCL is available from APDA for $495. For more information, contact
