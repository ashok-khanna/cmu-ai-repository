/pub/mcl2/patches/README

This file tells how to use the contents of this directory to patch
MCL 2.0 into MCL 2.0.1. If you don't yet have any of these files,
you might prefer to download "2.0->2.0.1.sea.hqx" unBinHex,
double click to expand the archive, then follow the directions in
the resulting "MCL 2.0 -> MCL 2.0.1" folder. Doing it that way is much
easier than what is described below as that installation is automoated.
This file describes the procedure if you download the files individually.

There are four patch files to be loaded into MCL 2.0:

mcl2.0p1.fasl.hqx
mcl2.0p2.fasl.hqx
faster-make-instance/faster-make-instance-patch.hqx
mcl2.0.1p0.fasl.hqx

First, convert all four files from BinHex format with BinHex 4.0, Compact
Pro, Stuffit, or another application that knows how.

Load "mcl 2.0p1.fasl" & "mcl 2.0p2.fasl" by putting them into the
"ccl:patches 2.0;" folder and executing (ccl::load-patches) in the
MCL 2.0 listener. Load the other two files with load, e.g.
(load "...:faster-make-instance-patch.fasl") & (load "É:mcl2.0.1p0.fasl").
More detailed information about the patch files can be found in
the files:

mcl2.0p1-notes.txt
mcl2.0p2.doc
faster-make-instance/about-fast-make-instance.txt
mcl2.0.1p0.doc

Note that files compiled with "faster-make-instance-patch" loaded will
generate an error if loaded into an MCL 2.0 that does not contain the
patch.

After loading the four patches into MCL 2.0, execute the following forms:

  (setq ccl::*new-lisp-patch-version* nil)
  (save-application "MCL 2.0.1" :init-file "Init")

Now get into ResEdit and patch two resources of the "MCL 2.0.1"
application using the files "MMU3" and "FPU-" contained. in the
following subdirectories of "/pub/mcl2/patches/" (after BinHex
conversion):

MMU3-for-IIci
Centris-without-FPU

There are more complete instructions contained with the ResEdit files.

While you're still in ResEdit, open the "vers" resource. There are two
resources, with ID's of 1 & 2. Open each of them and change all
instances of "2.0.0" to 2.0.1", "2.0" to "2.0.1", (and "2.0p2" to
"2.0.1" if there are any). Now save your changes and quit from ResEdit
and you've got an MCL 2.0.1 application.

The files "Examples-2.01.sea.hqx", "IFT-2.01.sea.hqx", &
"Library-2.01.sea.hqx" contain binhexed self extracting archives of
sources files that have changed in the "examples", "Interface Tools",
and "library" folders. UnBinHex them, double click on each of the
resulting applications, and select a location to save the "Examples
2.01", "IFT-2.01", and "Library-2.01" folders. Drag the contents of
each of these folders to the corresponding sub-folder of your "CCL:"
folder and click "Yes" when the Finder asks whether you want to
replace files with the same names. Actually, it's a little more
complicated than that. The "Examples-2.01" & "Library-2.01" folders
contain sub-folders. You need to copy each of the files to its
corresponding folder or sub-folder. E.g. don't replace your
"ccl:library;Interfaces:" folder with the "Interfaces sub-folder of
the "Library-2.01" folder or you'll lose most of the interface
files.

The file "ptable-2.01.hqx" contains a new ptable init.

The files in the "cyclone-cursor-patch" and "windoid-wdef-patch" directories
are part of "MCL2.0.1.fasl". They are provided here in case you want to load them
individually.

The files in the "AUX-on-quadra" and "MMU4-for-IIci" directories are NOT part
of MCL 2.0.1. "AUX-on-quadra" contains an init that will make MCL work under
AU/X on a 68040 Mac. "MMU4-for-IIci" makes MCL work correctly on a IIci with
a 68040 accelerator.
