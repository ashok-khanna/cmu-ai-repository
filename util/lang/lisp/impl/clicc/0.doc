Name:         CLiCC

Summary:      Common Lisp to C Compiler

Version:      0.6.4 (23-JUN-94); 0.6.2 (3-JAN-94); 0.6.1 (30-JUL-93)

Description: 

   CLiCC (Common Lisp to C Compiler) generates C-executables from Common
   Lisp application programs. CLiCC is not a Common Lisp system, and
   hence does not include any program development or debugging support.
   CLiCC is intended to be used as an add-on to existing Common Lisp
   systems for generating portable applications. CLiCC (version 0.6.2)
   can now compile itself to get a standalone compiler that may be used
   without a Lisp system. CLiCC supports CL_0, a subset of Common Lisp +
   CLOS, which excludes EVAL and related functions. At present CL_0 is
   based on CLtL1, but is headed towards CLtL2 and ANSI-CL. The generated
   C code (ANSI-C or K&R-C compatible) may be compiled using a
   conventional C compiler on the target machine, and must be linked with
   the CLiCC runtime library in order to generate executables. CLiCC
   has a foreign function interface.

   The generated C code is not readable in the sense of hand written C
   code. It results from a direct translation of abstract machine code
   to corresponding C constructs.

   The file CL0.ps.gz contains the report documenting the CommonLisp0
   and CLOS0 language (translated from German to English).

   The authors welcome suggestions and improvements and would appreciate
   receiving email even if you just used CLiCC successfully.
