Package:      lang/lisp/impl/cmucl/

Name:         CMU CL

Summary:      CMU Common Lisp

Version:      17f (4-NOV-94); 17e (11-MAR-94) 

Description: 

   CMU Common Lisp (CMU CL) is a high quality public domain Lisp system.
   It includes an incremental compiler, Hemlock emacs-style editor,
   source-code level debugger, code profiler and is mostly X3J13
   compatible, including the new loop macro.

   The new CMU CL compiler (Python) is more sophisticated than other
   Common Lisp compilers. It both produces better code and is easier to
   use. Python does many optimizations that are absent or less general in
   other Common Lisp compilers, and is particularly good at number
   crunching.

   See SUPPORT for important information regarding the support status of
   CMU CL. (In short, the CMU CL project is no longer funded by Arpa,
   so future support will be minimal. They'll fix bugs, especially
   those that affect the use of CMU CL as a cross-development vehicle
   for their Dylan work, but they won't be adding any major new features.
   Continuing the same level of support is not an option without ARPA
   or industrial financial support.) 

Requires:     16mb RAM (more is better)
              25mb disk (15mb basic config, 8mb for extras)

Ports:        HP 700 (HP-UX 9.0), Sparcs (Mach, SunOs 4.x, and Solaris), 
              DecStation 3100 (Mach), IBM RT (Mach), SGI MIPS (Iris),
              and DEC Alpha (OSF1).

              As of 11/11/93, the latest SunOS Sparc release (17c)
              should work with all versions of SunOS, but does *NOT*
              work under Solaris. 

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/clisp/release 
                 [128.2.206.173]
              The binary releases are contained in files of the form
                <version>-<machine>_<os>.tar.Z
                <version>-extra-<machine>_<os>.tar.Z
              The first file holds binaries and documentation for the
              basic Lisp system, while the second -extra file contains
              the Hemlock editor, the Motif toolkit, the graphical
              debugger, and the CLX interface to X11. Files of the form
                <version>-source.tar.Z
              are of possible interest since they contain all the ".lisp"
              source files used to build that version.
