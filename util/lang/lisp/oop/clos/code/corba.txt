                    OMG  Publications:
First  Class
First Class is OMG's non-commercial bi-monthly 28-page
newsletter. First Class provides current information on Object
Technology developments, both technically and commercially. First
Class offers an open editorial forum on numerous Object
Technology topics and issues.  This publication features
commentaries from software industry leaders, informative user
case histories, OT training information and the latest object-
oriented product announcements.  All OMG activities and the
ongoing development of the Object Management Architecture are
regularly reported.


Object  Management    Architecture    Guide   (OMA)
The members of the OMG have a shared goal of developing and using
integrated software systems.  These systems should be built using
a methodology that supports modular production of software;
encourages reuse of code; allows useful integration across lines
of developers, operating systems and hardware; and enhance long-
range maintenance of that code.  As an organization, OMG believes
that the object-oriented approach to software construction best
supports their goals.  The OMA publication outlines the
groundwork for technology response to Request for Proposals (RFP)
and the adoption of specifications.


The Common  Object   Request  Broker:  Architecture   and
Specification   (Corba)
The CORBA, as defined by the OMG's Object Request Broker (ORB),
provides the mechanisms by which objects transparently make
requests and receive responses. The ORB provides interoperability
between applications on different machines in heterogeneous
distributed environments and seamlessly interconnects multiple
object systems. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture and
Specification described in this published document is a self-
contained response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by
the ORB Task Force of the OMG.
