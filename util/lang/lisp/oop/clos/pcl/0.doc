Name:         PCL

Summary:      Portable implementation of CLOS.

Version:      JUL-92-1d, 16-SEP-92-f

Description: 

   CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) is the object-oriented programming
   standard for Common Lisp. It is the successor to Symbolics FLAVORS and
   Xerox LOOPS (Lisp Object Oriented Programming System). The acronym
   CLOS is pronouned either as "See-Loss" or "Closs", depending on taste.

   PCL (Portable Common Loops) is a portable CLOS implementation. It
   is not complete, but the differences won't affect most users. A key
   difference is PCL doesn't support the :METHOD option to DEFGENERIC. 
   We've included a file called pclfixes.cl (originally
   ags/prog/pcl-fixes.lisp) from the KEIM theorem prover that adds
   this capability.

   Most Common Lisp implementations now include their own CLOS
   implementations. Common Lisp implementations with native CLOS include:
   MCL, {A}KCL, Allegro CL (including Allegro CL\PC), Ibuki, Lucid,
   Medley, Symbolics Genera, CLOE, Harlequin Lispworks, and CLISP (SEP-93
   or newer).  CMU CL uses a customized version of PCL as their CLOS.
   However, not all native CLOS implementations have as detailed a
   meta-object protocol as PCL. For example, MCL 2.0 users sometimes use
   the july-1d version of PCL instead of the native CLOS for precisely
   this reason.
