<H2>COOL: Implementation of HP's CommonObjects on top of the 
              PCL metaclass kernel.</H2>

COOL is an implementation of HP's CommonObjects on the Portable
CommonLoops (PCL) metaclass kernel.  As such, it provides a portable
implementation of CommonObjects. It should be of particular interest
to people who want to program in the mixin style supported by PCL but
are also interested in trying the encapsulation style of Smalltalk,
which CommonObjects supports.

This version of COOL is guaranteed to work with Portable CommonLoops
system date 2-24-87. A copy of this version of Portable CommonLoops is
distributed along with COOL.
