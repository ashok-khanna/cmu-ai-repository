Name:         CL Shell

Summary:      Running Common Lisp as an Emacs subprocess.

Version:      18-OCT-93

Description: 

   The cl-shell package provides a major mode (cl-shell-mode) for running
   Common Lisp (CL) as an Emacs subprocess.  It provides a general
   mechanism for communication between CL and Emacs which does not rely
   on extra processes, and should therefore be easily portable to any
   version of CL.  Features include direct (i.e., not through a temp file)
   evaluation and in-package compilation of forms from lisp-mode buffers,
   type-ahead and a history mechanism for the cl-shell buffer, and pop-up
   help facilities for the CL functions documentation, macroexpand and
   describe.  Extensions for Lucid Common Lisp provide pop-up arglists
   and source file editing.  Other extensions are provided to allow
   editing source files of CLOS or Flavors methods.
