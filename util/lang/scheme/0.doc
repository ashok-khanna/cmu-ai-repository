Summary:      CMU Scheme Repository

Description:

   Welcome to the Scheme Repository.
   
   The Scheme Repository at CMU is part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence
   Repository. The goal of the Scheme Repository is to collect files and
   programs of general interest to Scheme programmers. Information
   files include the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) postings for the
   comp.lang.scheme newsgroup and copies of the RnRS standards for scheme.
   
   Thanks to Ozan S. Yigit, creator of the Internet Scheme Repository,
   for assistance in gathering materials for the Scheme section of the
   CMU AI Repository.
   
   This is NOT a precise mirror of the Internet Scheme Repository. Some
   of the materials have been relocated to more appropriate locations in
   the AI Repository. We also have some additional materials not
   currently present in the Internet Scheme Repository, and changed the
   organization significantly.
   
   If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
   this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
   important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
   of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
   signify your agreement to these conditions.
   
   To contribute files to the repository, first see section [7] of the
   readme.txt file. Then send mail to ai+scheme@cs.cmu.edu. If
   possible, please put the files in ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/new/.

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/lang/scheme/  [128.2.206.173]
              Give "anonymous" (without the quotes) at the username:
              prompt and type your email address (in the form "user@host")
              at the password: prompt. NOTE: There is *no* leading slash
              before user/ai/lang/scheme/; just type "cd user/ai/lang/scheme/"
              at the ftp> prompt.
              
              If you will be transferring compressed files, be sure to
              type the "binary" command before retrieving the files. The
              "get" command is used to get a single file, and "mget" to
              retrieve multiple files using wildcards.  If you're using
              the "mget" command, you might want to turn off prompting
              first by using the "prompt" command.
              
              The Lisp Utilities Repository is kept in the Andrew File
              System (AFS) directory
              /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/scheme/
              and its subdirectories. If your site runs AFS, you can
              just cd to this directory and copy the files directly.
              (The FTP location given above is just a link to the AFS
              directory.)
              
              Further information about AFS can be obtained by
              sending email to afs-sales@transarc.com.
