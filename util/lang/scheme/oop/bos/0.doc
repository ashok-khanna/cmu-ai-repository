Summary:      Bryan's Object System

Version:      25-AUG-94

Description: 

   BOS (Bryan's Object System) is a very small object system for Scheme.
   It is based around generic functions and multiple inheritance.  BOS
   provides more or less the same features as Meroon and the Tiny CLOS
   base language. Even though it has not been optimised, it should be
   quite a bit faster than those because it does not include a MOP.

Requires:     

Ports:        BOS has been tested under Scheme 48 and SCM, and should
              run under any fairly modern Scheme implementation
              (especially any which runs SLIB) with little or no change.
