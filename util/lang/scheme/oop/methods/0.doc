Description: 

   This directory contains Brian Beckman's tiny object-oriented programming
   system for Scheme. This system includes multiple inheritance and
   error handling. It is modeled after the message passing modules in
   Chapter 3 of Abelson & Sussman. 

   It is implemented in ``pure'' Scheme, without macros or syntax
   extensions.

   Documentation and examples are included.
