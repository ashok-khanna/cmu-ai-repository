   and some of the exercises from the book 

      George Springer and Daniel P. Friedman, "Scheme and the Art of
      Programming", MIT Press and McGraw Hill, 1990. 596 pages.

   SAP introduces the basic concepts of programming in Scheme. The book
   also deals with object oriented programming, co-routining,
   continuations.  It gives numerous examples. SAP has more of an
   emphasis on teaching Scheme than SICP, and can be seen as an
   alternative to SICP.
