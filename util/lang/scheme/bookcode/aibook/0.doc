Description: 

   This directory contains source code for

      Wolfgang Kreutzer and Bruce McKenzie, "Programming for
      Artificial Intelligence: Methods, Tools and Applications",
      Addison-Wesley (Reading, MA), 1990. 682 pages, ISBN 0-201-41621-2.

   Kreutzer and McKenzie's book discusses Scheme, Prolog, and Smalltalk,
   gives an overview of the history and philosophy of AI, and surveys
   three major programming paradigms (procedural, declarative, and
   object-oriented) and metaphors for AI programming.

Requires:     

Ports:        Some of the programs (such as the CFlavours system) will
              run under only MacScheme. Most of the code has been
              tested in XScheme, Tau Scheme, Chez Scheme, and TI Scheme.
