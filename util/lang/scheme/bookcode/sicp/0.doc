Description: 

   This directory contains source code for the examples from the text

      Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, with Julie Sussman.  "Structure
      and Interpretation of Computer Programs", MIT Press (Cambridge, MA)
      and McGraw-Hill (New York), 1985.  542 pages. ISBN 0-262-01077-1.

   The book starts off introductory, but rapidly gets into powerful
   Lisp-particular constructs, such as using closures and engines,
   building interpreters, compilers and object-oriented systems.  Often
   referred to by its acronym, SICP, which is pronounced "Sick-Pee". This
   is the classical text for teaching program design using Scheme,
   and everybody should read it at least once.
