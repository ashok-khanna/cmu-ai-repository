Summary:      Proposals and implementations for macros in Scheme.

Description:

   This directory contains the various low and high-level proposals for 
   macro facilities for Scheme, including the R4RS syntactic
   abstraction proposal, lexically-scoped macros, syntactic closures,
   explicit renaming, and syntax-case. Some implementations are included.
