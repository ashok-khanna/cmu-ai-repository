<H2>Scheme48: Portable and efficient implementation of Scheme.</H2>

Scheme 48 is a Scheme implementation based on a virtual machine
architecture. Scheme 48 is designed to be straightforward, flexible,
reliable, and fast. It should be easily portable to 32-bit
byte-addressed machines that have POSIX and ANSI C support.

In addition to the usual Scheme built-in procedures and a development
environment, library software includes support for hygienic macros (as
described in the Revised^4 Scheme report), multitasking, records,
exception handling, hash tables, arrays, weak pointers, and FORMAT.

Scheme 48 implements and exploits an experimental module system
loosely derived from Standard ML and Scheme Xerox.  The development
environment supports interactive changes to modules and interfaces.
This feature makes the module system significantly easier to work with
than it would be otherwise.

The virtual machine executes a byte-code instruction set similar to
the target of the Scheme 311 compiler [Clinger, LFP 1984].  The
interpreter for the virtual instruction set is itself written in
Pre-Scheme, a systems programming dialect of Scheme.  A Pre-Scheme
compiler applies intensive source-to-source rewrites to the
interpreter source code and emits low-level C code.  When the output
is then compiled by an optimizing C compiler such as gcc, the result
is an efficient and portable emulator.

The virtual machine is initialized from a specified memory image
containing byte-compiled Scheme code and data.  Images, including
small stand-alone applications, are built either using a static linker
or by writing out a procedure from an executing program.  A standard
memory image contains a Scheme run-time library (APPEND, READ, WRITE,
etc.), a compiler from Scheme to the virtual instruction set, and a
command processor and debugger.  In this way Scheme 48 can be
configured to look like a conventional Lisp interpreter.

The Pre-Scheme compiler, which produces scheme48vm.c from vm/*.scm, is
distributed separately.  For information contact

This is a BETA release.
