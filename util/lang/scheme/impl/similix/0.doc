Name:         Similix

Summary:      Self-Applicable Partial Evaluator for a Subset of Scheme.

Version:      5.0 (May 1993)

Description: 

   Similix is an autoprojector (self-applicable partial evaluator) for a
   large higher-order subset of the strict functional language Scheme.
   Similix treats source programs that use a limited class of
   side-effects, for instance input/output operations. Similix handles
   partially static data structures.

   Similix is automatic: in general, no user annotations (such as
   unfolding information) are required; user assistance may in some cases
   be required to avoid looping, however. Similix gives certain
   guarantees concerning the residual programs it generates: computations
   are never discarded (partial evaluation thus preserves termination
   properties) and never duplicated.

   Similix is well-suited for partially evaluating interpreters that use
   environments represented as functions and interpreters written in
   continuation passing style. Since Similix is self-applicable,
   stand-alone compilers can be generated from interpreters.

   Similix is highly portable. It conforms to the IEEE and R4RS Scheme
   standards, but it also runs under R3RS Scheme. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Similix runs in SCM, Chez Scheme and T3.1.
