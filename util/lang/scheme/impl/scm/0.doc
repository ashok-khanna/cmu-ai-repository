Name:         SCM

Summary:      Portable implementation of a R4RS Scheme in C.

Description:

   SCM is a portable implementation of Scheme written in C.  SCM conforms
   to the Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme and the
   IEEE P1178 specification. SCM supports ASCII and EBCDIC.
   
   For those without ftp access, an IBM PC floppy disk with the source
   files and MSDOS and i386 executables is available for $99 from Aubrey
   Jaffer (see address below). 
   
   If you find SCM useful, please support the development and
   maintenance of SCM by sending money to Aubrey, even if you
   got SCM by anonymous ftp. This will help fund continued development
   work on SCM.
   
   Other packages distributed with SCM, some of which are required
   to use SCM, include:
   
      SCMCONFIG    Contains additional files for the SCM distribution to
                   build SCM on Unix machines using GNU autoconf.
   
      HOBBIT       Compiler for SCM code.
   
      SMG-SCM      Adds VMS SMG screen management routines to SCM.
   
      TURTLSCM     Turtle graphics package which works with SCM on MSDOS
                   or X11 machines.
   
      WB           Disk based, sorted associative array (B-tree)
                   library for SCM. Using WB, large databases can be
                   created and managed from SCM. 
   
      XSCM         X windows interface package for Xlib and the Motif
                   and OpenLook toolkits which works with SCM.
   
      JACAL        Symbolic math system written in Scheme.
   
      SLIB         Portable Scheme library used by SCM. 
   
      SLIB-PSD     Portable debugger for Scheme (requires emacs editor).
   
      TEST         Tests the correctness of Scheme implementations.
   
      MacSCM       Macintosh Support Library
   
   Those packages which aren't included in this directory may be found
   elsewhere in the Scheme section of the repository. (See "See Also" below.)

Ports:        Runs on Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE,
              VMS, Unix and similar systems.
