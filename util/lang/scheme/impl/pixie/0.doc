Name:         Pixie Scheme

Summary:      R3RS-compatible Scheme for the Macintosh

Version:      May, 1990

Description: 

   Pixie Scheme is an implementation of a Scheme interpreter for the
   Macintosh with nearly complete coverage of R3RS. The interpreter is
   very slow. It also has limited numeric types, with no numeric types
   beyond 32-bit integer and 32-bit and 80-bit floats. 
 
   The distribution includes two program versions (one uses
   68020 / 68881 code, the other runs on a straight MC68000) and
   a HyperCard help stack.

   Pixie Scheme is distributed as shareware; the author would be
   delighted to receive a one dollar donation from each user.

Requires:     Macintosh Plus or better. 1mb RAM, System software 6 or newer.
