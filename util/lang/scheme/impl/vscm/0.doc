Name:         VSCM

Summary:      Portable R4RS Scheme implementation.

Version:      V0r4 (5-AUG-94)

Description: 

   VSCM is a portable R4RS Scheme. The implementation is based on a
   virtual machine design with heavy support for most of the
   sophisticated features of Scheme. The virtual machine is written in
   ANSI-C to aid in its portability. The bytecode compiler is written in
   Scheme itself.

   Extensions to R4RS include: 
      -  ability to create a memory image of a running VSCM (dump)
      -  ability to execute a shell command (system)
      -  continuations with multiple arguments (call-with-values)
      -  error handling (with-error-handler)
      -  flexible garbage collection (with-gc-strategy)
      -  interrupts (with-interrupt-handler)
      -  errors (error)
      -  CPU time measurements (clock, gc-clock, timer)
      -  access to the environment (getenv)
      -  eval
      -  control over open compilation
      -  file system interface (remove-file, rename-file, etc.)
      -  generic ports
      -  writing to and reading from strings
      -  property lists
