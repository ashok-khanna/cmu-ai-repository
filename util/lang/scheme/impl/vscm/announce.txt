Version 0, release 2 of VSCM is now available.  It can be obtained via
anonymous ftp (binary transmisson mode!) from

	nexus.yorku.ca:/pub/scheme/imp/vscmV0r2.tar.Z

This is mostly a bug-fixing release, there haven't been major changes.
This release also includes a customization file (slib/vscm.init) to
allow for SLIB to work under VSCM.

Some documentation (files README and DESCRIPTION) is included.  If you
want to learn what VSCM is about, then you can also find the documentation
on the World Wide Web.

A new release of VSCM -- V0r3 -- is now available via anonymous ftp
from the Scheme repository at Indiana University.  The address is

	ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/imp/vscmV0r3.tar.Z

(This is a WWW style URL, for ordinary ftp log anonymously into
ftp.cs.indiana.edu and fetch file /pub/scheme-repository/imp/vscmV0r3.tar.Z
in binary transmission mode.)

This is a mostly bug-fixing release.  The compressed tar file has
grown quite a bit since the last update was released, because I
included some (normally) redundant files:

	compiler/vscmc.asm	(compiled compiler (big))
	vbis.sort		(sorted virtual instruction table)

(The system itself has NOT grown (in size :) at the same rate!)

These files are included to aid porting VSCM to Mac platforms.  File
THINKC.inst has instructions for this (courtesy of Ken Dickey).
Also, subdirectory slib has (some) support for SLIB.
(If anybody finds out why booting VSCM from the bootfile provided
doesn't work on the Mac, then please tell me!  I don't have access to
Think C, so I can't do this myself.)

Documentation for VSCM comes with the distribution and can also be
found on the WWW.  The URL is

	http://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/blume/vscm.html

[For the interested:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/blume/modules.{ps,dvi}
contains a paper describing a proposed module system for Scheme.  If
anybody cares to comment on this -- I would appreciate it.]

Have fun!
