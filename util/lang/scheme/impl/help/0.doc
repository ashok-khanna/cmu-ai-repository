Name:         HELP

Summary:      A lazy Scheme interpreter

Version:      1.4 (12-JAN-93)

Description: 

   HELP (a lazy Scheme) is a complete and efficient Scheme-like
   functional lazy Lisp interpreter. It has a 'friendly' interface
   (parenthesis matcher, auto-indent), uses a full call-by-need semantics
   and includes many examples, including a symbolic compiler for the
   680x0. Efficiency is good and the laziness is fully parametrizable (you
   may turn Help into a strict Scheme-like language if you like). French
   AND English updated docs are included in Word4 and plain text formats.

Requires:     

Ports:        It works only on 68020 (or better) based Macintoshes.
              System 7.0 compatible.
