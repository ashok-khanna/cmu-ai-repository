Package:      lang/scheme/impl/stk/

Name:         STk

Summary:      R4RS Scheme with access to the Tk graphics package.

Version:      2.1 (12-JUN-94); 2.0 (4-JAN-94)

Description: 

   STk is a R4RS Scheme interpreter which can access the Tk graphical
   package. All of the commands defined by the Tk toolkit are available
   to the STk interpreter, and Tk variables are reflected back into
   Scheme as Scheme variables. Callback is expressed in Scheme. Includes
   a CLOS-like OO extension called STklos, which provides multiple
   inheritance, generic functions, multi methods, and a true meta-object
   protocol.  A set of classes have been defined to manipulate Tk
   commands (menu, buttons, scales, canvas, canvas items) as Scheme
   objects. 

   Based in part on SIOD.

Requires:     Supports Tk 3.6.

Ports:        Mostly R4RS compliant. (Some number procedures are not
              implemented, over-simplified call/cc, symbol case is
              significant.) 

              STk runs on Sparc (SUNOS 4.1.x), Dec 5xxx (Ultrix 4.2), 
              SGI (Irix 4.05, 5.1.1), DEC Alpha, and Linux 1.0.
