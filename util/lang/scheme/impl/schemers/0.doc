Summary:      Demo version of 3D Scheme for Windows from Schemer's Inc.

Version:      1.0

Description: 

   Schemers Inc. publishes software and textbooks that promote the
   use and advancement of Scheme in the educational and commercial
   sectors. This directory contains a demo version of 3D Scheme for Windows.

   3DScheme for Windows v1.0 is a Windows-based R4RS Scheme
   interpreter incorporating over 450 geometrical Scheme primitives that 
   access Spatial Technology Inc's ACIS (R) Geometric Modeling Kernel,
   the de facto industry standard in 3D modeling. The 3D modeling
   features include:

     -  construction of solid bodies from blocks, cylinders, cone
	frustums, spheres, and toruses.
     -  construction of wire-bodies from straight, circular,
	elliptical, Bezier, and spline edges.
     -  construction of solids by extruding planar faces or
	profiles along a vector or revolving about an axis.
     -  application of rigid transformations, uniform scaling, and
	boolean operations. 
     -  intersect, trim, fillet, and chain edges.
     -  simultaneous views of solids from several different angles.
     -  dynamically accepted event-driven input for picking,
	rubber banding, or dragging.
     -  rendering of solids using flat or Gouraud technology and
	configurable refinements, materials, texture spaces, and
	render lights. 
     -  saving and loading collections of solid and wire entities
	from disk in .sat format.
     -  outputting rendered images as high resolution bitmaps or
	Postscript files. 

   3DScheme is seamlessly integrated with the WinScheme Editor.
   3DScheme also ships with the "Getting Started with Scheme" book.  
   3DScheme for Windows retails for $495.  (Note: The WinScheme Editor
   is integrated into 3DScheme and does not need to be ordered separately.)

   Their other products include:

      +  The WinScheme Editor v1.02, a Windows full-featured MDI
         editor for Scheme programs. $89.95.

      +  EdScheme for Windows v4.2, a R4RS-compatibile Windows-based
         Scheme interpreter.  $129.95 (includes WinScheme editor)

         Scheme interpreter. $59.95.

      +  EdScheme for DOS v3.4, a DOS-based Scheme interpreter than
         incorporates a large subset of R4RS. $49.95.

     +  "The Schemer's Guide" by Iain Ferguson with Edward Martin and 
          Burt Kaufman, and foreword by Daniel Friedman. Excellent
          introduction to Scheme. $35.95.
