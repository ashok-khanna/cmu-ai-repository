Name:         Elk

Summary:      Extension Language Kit interpreter for Scheme

Version:      2.2 (9-FEB-94)

Description: 

   Elk (Extension Language Kit) is a Scheme interpreter designed to be
   used as a general extension language for applications written in C or
   C++. Elk can also be used as a stand-alone implementation of the
   Scheme programming language. It is mostly R4RS and P1178 conformant
   (with the exception of the number system and a few minor details).  It
   has interfaces to Xlib, Xt, and the Athena and OSF/Motif widget sets.
   It includes dynamic incremental linking of C object files, an
   optional foreign function interface, and a generational garbage
   collector. Elk can also freeze a fully customized application into a
   new executable file. Other features include a simple macro
   facility, environments as first-class objects, dynamic-wind,
   fluid-let, autoloading, and provide/require.

Requires:
