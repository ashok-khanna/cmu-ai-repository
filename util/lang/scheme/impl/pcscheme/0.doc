Name:         PC Scheme

Summary:      Scheme implementation for IBM PCs

Description:

   PC-Scheme is a Scheme implementation originally written by Texas
   Instruments.  This directory contains the version made public by
   TI. Note that the public version wasn't as powerful as the
   commercial version.
   
   The University of Geneva produced a cleaned up implementation of the
   public version and have called it PCS/Geneva. PCS/Geneva is also
   available from this directory.
   
   NOTE: Ibuki announced on July 13, 1992, that it has purchased the
   rights to PC Scheme from TI and intends to make it also available on
   486 PCs and under Windows 3.1. This version should be better than
   either of the public versions. For more information, contact IBUKI, 
   PO Box 1627, Los Altos, CA 94022, phone 415-961-4996, fax 415-961-8016,
