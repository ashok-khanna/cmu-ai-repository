Name:         PCS/Geneva

Summary:      Reimplementation of PC Scheme by Univ. of Geneva.

Version:      4.02PL1 (11-JAN-94)

Description: 

   PCS/Geneva is a Scheme interpreter/compiler developed at the
   University of Geneva. It is based on Texas Instrument's PC Scheme
   (version 3.03) but differs somewhat from the original. The main
   extensions to PC Scheme are 486 support, BGI graphics, LIM-EMS
   pagination support, line editing, mouse support, assembly-level
   interfacing, and several powerful Scheme-oriented editors. (TI's PC
   Scheme gives users full Revised^3 support along with many primitives
   for DOS, Graphics and Text Windows. A powerful built-in optimizing
   compiler produces fast code.)

Requires:     

Ports:        PCS/Geneva has been tested on XTs, ATs, AT386s and
              AT486s under various DOS and OS/2 versions. It even runs
              on Hewlett-Packard's HP95LX. It also runs on Suns with a
              DOS emulator.
