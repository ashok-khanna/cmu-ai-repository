Welcome, dear Schemers !
This is the new release of PC scheme, hopefully fixing all the bugs that
were mentionned. Thanks to your participation, PCS/Geneva has eventually
become an (acceptably!) stable product. Don't forget, though, that bugs
may have been left out. If you feel you found one, make a good deed and
tell us about it. Our mailing address is still "schemege@uni2a.unige.ch".

PCS is distributed in two formats:
- PCSCHEME.EXE is a self-extracting file, compressed with ARJ.
- PCSCHEME.TAZ is a 'gzip'ped tar file.
Please note some people reported a problem with PCSCHEME.EXE, saying
it aborted with the message 'Out of Memory'. This happens when the
file is downloaded in ASCII mode, so beware! Both files are in binary
format.

This new release includes a few goodies:
- First there is no more encryption on the files; this is justified by
	the fact PCS is not a hack anymore...
- Many small programs have been written, mostly in Scheme-WEB, to test
	various aspects of the system. Their documentation is supposed
	to be adequate. They include a system to display Hershey fonts
	in graphics mode, an interface for the Brief(TM) editor, and
	various simple things like digits of E and the Fibonacci sequence,
	among others.
- I have written a few BGI drivers, one that simply dumps the requests
	and one that creates a PostScript output. The environment
	variable "PS$" should be set to the filename where the output
	should be written; if the variable is not set, PS.BGI sends the
	output to the terminal. Note the source code is included!

Of course, your comments, suggestions, and even flames are welcome.
