Name:         PC Scheme

Summary:      Scheme implementation for IBM PCs

Version:      3.03

Description: 

   PC-Scheme is a Scheme implementation originally written by Texas
   Instruments.  This directory contains the version made freely
   distributable by TI. Note that the public version wasn't as
   powerful as the commercial version, which costs $95 and includes a
   reference manual and user guide. [The commercialized version is no
   longer available. See the note about Ibuki purchasing the rights below.]

   PC Scheme includes an optimizing compiler, an emacs-like editor,
   inspector, debugger, performance testing, foreign function interface,
   window system and an object-oriented subsystem.  Conforms to the
   Revised^3 Report on Scheme. Also supports the dialect used in Abelson
   and Sussman's SICP.

   NOTE: Ibuki announced on July 13, 1992, that it has purchased the
   rights to PC Scheme from TI and intends to make it also available on
   486 PCs and under Windows 3.1. This version should be better than
   either of the public versions and will be supported by Ibuki. For
   more information, contact IBUKI, PO Box 1627, Los Altos, CA 94022,
   phone 415-961-4996, fax 415-961-8016, email rww@ibuki.com. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs on MS-DOS 286/386 IBM PCs and compatibles.
              Version 3.0, the one that comes with the student
              edition, doesn't run on the 486, but the free upgrade
              (pcscm3_3.exe) works fine, as does the full version 3.03.
