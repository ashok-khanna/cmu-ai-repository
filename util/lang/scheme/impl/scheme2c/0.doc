Name:         Scheme->C

Summary:      Scheme implementation that compiles Scheme into C.

Version:      15-MAR-93

Description: 

   Scheme->C is an R4RS compliant Scheme system that is centered around
   a compiler that compiles Scheme to C. The C code is then compiled
   by the native C compiler for the target machine. This design results
   in a portable and efficient system that allows either stand-alone
   Scheme programs or programs written in a mix of compiled and
   interpreted Scheme and compiled code from C, C++ and other languages.  

   Besides the base language, the system includes "expansion passing
   style" macros, a foreign function call capability, records, weak
   pointers, three X11 interfaces, call/cc, and a generational,
   conservative, copying garbage collector. Numbers are represented
   internally as 30-bit integers (62-bit integers on Alpha AXP), or 64-bit
   floating point values.

   The system is oriented towards block compilation to generate code
   which can run in standalone programs which may include code from
   other languages.  While debugging is typically done using the
   interpreter, it will never be considered a "Scheme environment".

   The compiler is written in Scheme.  Most of the runtime system
   (including an interpreter) is written in Scheme.  The generational garbage
   collector and a few other things are written in C.  There is a small
   (< 100) amount of assembly code.

   The system has three different interfaces to X11, all written in
   Scheme. All are available gatekeeper (see Origin below).  The first is
   a complete set of stubs to Xlib included in the base system.  The
   second is an alternative to Xlib called SCIX, found in
   pub/X11/contrib.  The third, ezd, allows programs to easily produce
   interactive, structured graphics and is found in pub/DEC/ezd.

Requires:     

Ports:        The current release of Scheme->C runs on the following
              systems: Digital Alpha AXP systems with OSF/1, MIPS
              based DECstations, VAXen with ULTRIX, MIPS based SGI
              systems, PC's running Microsoft Windows 3.1, Apple
              Macintosh's running system 7.1, HP 9000/300, HP
              9000/700, Sony News, Harris Nighthawk and other m88k 
              systems, linux, and Sun SPARC.  

              Earlier releases also run on Sun3, DNx500, DN1000, 386's
              running Unix, DNx500, and DN1000 systems.   

              Users of the system have contributed ports to other
              systems and these include: Harris Nighthawk (a
              multiprocessor m88k based computer), linux, and Sun SPARC.

              Ports to other systems should be straightforward.
