Name:         Lisp2TeX

Summary:      For inserting Scheme/Lisp code in TeX files.

Version:      4-FEB-94

Description: 

   LiSP2TeX is a system that allows easy insertions of Scheme, or Lisp,
   code towards TeX files. The originality of LiSP2TeX is that it
   extracts Scheme definitions from the files where they appear and wraps
   them appropriately within TeX macros for insertion into the
   documentation file. LiSP2TeX decorrelates writing documentation from
   programming: it is therefore possible to separately develop programs
   and documentations and to merge them at the end to produce up to date
   final documents. LiSP2TeX also has some pretty-printing capabilities
   to produce denotations full of greek letters. 

   Documentation is included in the distribution.
