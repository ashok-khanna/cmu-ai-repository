Package:      lang/scheme/util/sweb/

Name:         SchemeWEB

Summary:      Generate Lisp and LaTeX code from the same source file.

Version:      2.0 (25-FEB-94)

Description: 

   SchemeWEB provides simple support for literate programming in Lisp.
   SchemeWEB version 2.0 is a Unix filter that allows you to generate
   both Lisp and LaTeX code from one source file.  The generated LaTeX
   code formats Lisp programs in typewriter font obeying the spacing in
   the source file.  Comments can include arbitrary LaTeX commands.
   SchemeWEB was originally developed for the Scheme dialect of Lisp, but
   it can easily be used with most other dialects.  

   A SchemeWEB file is a Lisp source file which contains code sections
   and comment sections, but each section is identified in a novel way.
   A code section begins with a line whose first character is a left
   parenthesis.  It continues until a line is found which contains the
   parenthesis that matches the one which started the code section.  The
   remaining lines of text in the source file are treated as comments.
