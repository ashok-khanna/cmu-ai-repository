Summary:      MIT Scheme Problem Set Database

Version:      1.0 (11-APR-90)

Description: 

   This directory contains the User's Manual, example code, and
   problem sets from MIT's course "6.001 Structure and Interpretation of
   Computer Programs". Some of the examples come from the SICP book.
   The problem sets include most of those used in the course from Spring
   1981 through Spring 1990. No solutions are included, but the problem
   sets are organized according to the subject matter that they cover.
   Also included is a history of the problem set usage in 6.001, and some
   Scheme problem sets not developed at MIT.

   The database of problem sets was organized by Franklyn Turbak.
