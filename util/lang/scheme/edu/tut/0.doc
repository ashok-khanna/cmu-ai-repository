Summary:      Source code from a Scheme-based algorithms class at
              Tampere University of Technology.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains source code for various data structures and
   algorithms that are covered at Tampere University of Technology in the
   course 81120, "Data Structures and Algorithms".

   Includes code for AVL trees, binary trees, various queue
   implementations, DFS search, Dijkstra's algorithm, expression
   evaluation, Floyd's shortest path algorithm, finite-state machines,
   graph traversal, hash tables, heap sort, Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
   for string searching, matrices, merge sort, quicksort, random numbers,
   selection sort, skew heaps, stacks, and string searching.
