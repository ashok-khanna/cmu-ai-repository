Name:         RSA

Summary:      Toy RSA public-key encryption system.

Version:      

Description: 

   The toy implementation of the RSA public-key encryption system is
   not included in the repository for two reasons:

      +  Making a file available by anonymous FTP is technically
         exporting it, US law prohibits the export of any 'munition',
         and cryptosystems are considered munitions.

      +  RSA is a patented algorithm, and permission is required to
         publish RSA code.
