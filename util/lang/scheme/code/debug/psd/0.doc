Package:      lang/scheme/code/debug/psd/

Name:         PSD

Summary:      Portable Scheme Debugger

Version:      1.3 (4-MAY-94)

Description: 

   With PSD, the portable Scheme debugger, you can do source code
   debugging for any R4RS compliant Scheme interpreter when run in a GNU
   Emacs buffer (either version 18 or 19). PSD lets you set and clear
   breakpoints, single step evaluation, follow execution in an editor
   window, and examine and change a program's variables. You can also let
   a program run until an error occurs, and then examine the state of the
   program. It works by instrumenting the original source code, so it
   should run with any R4RS compliant Scheme.  Includes documentation and
   user's manual.

Requires:     

Ports:        It has been tested with SCM, Elk 1.5, and the sci
              interpreter in the Scheme->C system, but should work
              with other Schemes with a minimal amount of porting.
              PSD should run in any R4RS Scheme without any porting at all.
