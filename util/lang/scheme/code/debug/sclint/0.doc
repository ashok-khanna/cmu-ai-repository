Summary:      A lint-like program for Scheme.

Version:      0.9 (8-MAR-93)

Description: 

   SCLINT is a lint-like program for Scheme. It checks for consistency of
   indentation, syntax of special forms, and the number of arguments to
   primitive and most user-defined procedures. This is not a full
   implementation, but rather a quick hack. It is used in teaching
   programming at the Tampere University of Technology.
