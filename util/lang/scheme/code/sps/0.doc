Description: 

   This directory contains the Semantic Prototyping System (SPS).  SPS
   is a suite of programs, written in Scheme, for rapid prototyping
   and testing of language definitions written using denotational
   semantics.  It consists of an ML-style type checker for a large
   subset of Scheme, along with an LL(1) parser and transducer
   generator.
