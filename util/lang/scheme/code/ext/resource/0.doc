Name:         Resources

Summary:      Implementation of resources (weak pools) for Scheme.

Version:      

Description: 

   This is an implementation of resources for Scheme. Rather than rely
   on the garbage collector, it provides pools of objects which can be
   reused. When you need an object, it allocates one from the pool,
   creating a new object if necessary. When an object is no longer
   needed, it gets returned to the pool. This can help avoid thrashing
   if the objects are only needed for brief periods of time.
