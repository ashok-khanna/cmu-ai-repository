Name:         Soft Scheme

Summary:      Practical soft type system for Scheme.

Version:      0.08 (11-JAN-94)

Description: 

   Soft Scheme provides the benefits of static typing for dynamically
   typed Scheme.  Like a static type checker, a soft type checker infers
   types for variables and expressions.  But rather than reject programs
   containing untypable fragments, a soft type checker inserts explicit
   run-time checks to transform untypable programs to typable form.
   These run-time checks indicate potential program errors, enabling
   programmers to detect errors prior to program execution.  Soft type
   checking minimizes the number of run-time checks in the compiled code,
   enabling dynamically typed languages to attain the efficiency of
   statically typed languages like ML.

Requires:     

Ports:        Tested in Chez Scheme and SCM. Should run in any R4RS Scheme.
