Name:         Character Sets

Summary:      Implementation of character sets in Scheme.

Version:      26-MAY-93

Description: 

   A character set is, as its name might suggest, a set for storing
   characters.  Such sets are often particularly useful in string
   processing applications.  The reason for treating sets of characters
   in a special manner is that until the advent of UNICODE and ISO ???,
   character sets only contained a maximum of 255 characters and so this
   fact could be taken advantage of in an implementation.  The usual
   approach being to store a character set as a bit set.

Requires:
