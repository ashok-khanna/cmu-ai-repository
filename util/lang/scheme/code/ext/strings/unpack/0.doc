Package:      lang/scheme/code/ext/strings/unpack/

Name:         

Summary:      Unpack integers from a string.

Version:      03 (21-MAY-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains routines to unpack various sized integers
   (8,16,24,32 bit) from a string.  The routines are a cross between
   string->integer with a radix of 255 and part of Perl's unpack
   facility.  Only the unsigned routines are really necessary, the others
   can be synthesised from them.  They are only included here for
   historical reasons.  Note that the numbers are extracted in network
   (big endian) order.
