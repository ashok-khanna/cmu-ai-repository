Subject: note about the lists

To prevent any more subscription requests from appearing on the lists,
my mailing list software now looks for certain keywords (e.g.,
subscribe, signoff, unsubscribe, etc.) in the message. If it finds
any, it will redirect the message to me for approval.

It is trivial for me to add new mailing lists. If folks want to see
more specialized job announcement mailing lists (e.g., nlp-jobs,
robotics-jobs, etc.), let me know and I'll add them.

Right now the lisp-jobs mailing list has 341 members, of which about
40 have been added since the list was moved from anzus.com to
cs.cmu.edu. The ai-jobs mailing list has 38 members so far, and the
prolog-jobs mailing list has 46 members.

As a matter of policy, the contents of these mailing lists are
considered confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

programming abilities are required, along with the interpersonal skills to
converse with domain experts and users who are not technology specialists. A
master's degree in computer science or closely related field is preferred. The
position is full-time with competitive salary and benefits.  The work
environment is a small but growing rearch and development group backed by the
