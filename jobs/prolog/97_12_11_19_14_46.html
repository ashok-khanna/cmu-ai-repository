The Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International has an
immediate need for a first-rate programmer with experience in Prolog
and C to join our spoken language systems group.  This person will
join a small group of computer scientists, computational linguists,
and speech scientists, helping to bridge the gap between
state-of-the-art speech recognition and natural language understanding
technologies and real-world applications which were designed for
mouse-and-menu interfaces.  The ideal candidate will have a Masters
degree in Computer Science (we may consider exceptional Bachelors
candidates), and significant experience programming in Prolog and
C/C++.  Beyond that, versatility is the key, with experience in Perl,
HTML, Java, TCL/TK, X Windows, Win NT or Linux being definite pluses.


For more information on the Spoken Language Systems group, see

or the CommandTalk project, a spoken language interface to
entity-based battlefield simulations, see
