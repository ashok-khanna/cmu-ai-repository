                     Two Research Posts Available


We are looking for two full-time postdoctoral research assistants to
work on an EPSRC-funded 3-year project entitled `Analysis of
Naturally-occurring English Text with Stochastic Lexicalized Grammars'.
Our goal is to develop a robust wide-coverage parsing system capable of
accurate analysis of naturally-occurring English text to the
logical-form level. This work will exploit a combination of statistical
techniques involving online corpora, inheritance hierarchies for
imposing structure on NLP data, and lexicalised grammars.

Preference will be given to applicants with a PhD in Computational
Linguistics and good programming skills (preferably including
LISP or C). Experience of developing tools for language engineering
would also be an advantage.

Both appointments will be made on the RA 1A scale (#14317 - #21519)
with USS superannuation.

Further details about the project can be found at
http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/lab/nlp/dtg/details.html. Information about
the NLP group at the University of Sussex can be found at
http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/lab/nlp/index.html. Contact the grant-holders
(see below) for specific queries. Applications should be submitted via
email and should include a latex source/postscript CV and the names and
email addresses of three referees.
