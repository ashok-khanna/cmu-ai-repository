To: ai+lisp-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
Subject: Jobs: Six openings for Lisp based, Dynamic Logic CAD development
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

LOCATION: 
  Dallas, Texas

ORGANIZATION: 
  Texas Instruments, Semiconductor Division, Advanced Microprocesor Group.

POSITION: 
  Six full time positions.

PROJECT: 
  The Advanced Microprocesor Group of Texas Instruments is developing a
high end X86 microprocessor which requires the development of a suite of
custom CAD tools in order to support the use of aggressive dynamic logic
circuit design techniques.  The tools are being developed in Lisp and C.

QUALIFICATIONS: 
  Strong Common Lisp and CLOS skills (Allegro CL on Sun Platforms).
  Experience with a programming team, not just one-person projects.
  Previous Computer Aided Design (CAD) work, preferrably in Lisp,
   preferably in areas of simulation, synthesis, timing analysis, 
   circuit analysis, or layout.
  Some VLSI design experience preferable, including using simulation 
   and synthesis tools.
  Unix and C/C++ skills will be required of some team members.
  Senior team members will have strong backgrounds in all or most of
   these areas, less senior members will have experience in most of 
   these areas.
  

DUTIES: 
  Join a senior team to develop CAD tools which will enable the design
of high performance X86 microprocessors using dynamic logic. The tools
to be developed in Lisp and C include electrical and circuit
verification tools, clocking analysis, timing directed dynamic logic
synthesis, charge sharing analysis, timing verification, input/ouput
parser/generators, floorplan/wiring estimators, incremental database
support/development, and support tools for simulation/emulation. Duties
will include supporting code in response to bugs reported by designers.
