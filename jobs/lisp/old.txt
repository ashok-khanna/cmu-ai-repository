Subject: note about the lists

To prevent any more subscription requests from appearing on the lists,
my mailing list software now looks for certain keywords (e.g.,
subscribe, signoff, unsubscribe, etc.) in the message. If it finds
any, it will redirect the message to me for approval.

It is trivial for me to add new mailing lists. If folks want to see
more specialized job announcement mailing lists (e.g., nlp-jobs,
robotics-jobs, etc.), let me know and I'll add them.

Right now the lisp-jobs mailing list has 341 members, of which about
40 have been added since the list was moved from anzus.com to
cs.cmu.edu. The ai-jobs mailing list has 38 members so far, and the
prolog-jobs mailing list has 46 members.

As a matter of policy, the contents of these mailing lists are
considered confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

 APPLICATION PROGRAMMER POSITION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER

Position: Software Engineer / Systems Analyst / Programmer

Location: NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA

Computer programmer needed to design and implement complex space science
support software using integrated commercial off-the-shelf applications.
Initial programming tasks will involve upgrading the existing system to use
current versions of LabVIEW (National Instruments), HyperCard (Claris) and
CLIPS (NASA) on the Macintosh platform. As the project evolves, migration to
a RISC-based platform is likely. Programming in C, Lisp, CLIPS and LabVIEW
will then be required. The user interface will be developed under X or Motif.
Whether on the Macintosh or the RISC-based platform, rapid prototyping will
first be required. As the user requirements crystallize, flight-qualified
software will be developed. Therefore, the candidate must be able to produce
robust, well-documented code quickly. Good communications skills are required
to interface to various NASA personnel as well as outside scientists,
hardware manufacturers, software vendors, contractors, etc. The candidate
will also be responsible for design and development of Mosaic project
presentation, possibly extending to other space science aspects.

The ideal candidate is a strong programmer with diverse experience on the Mac
and some UNIX environment. Experience developing in some of LabVIEW, CLIPS,
HyperCard, C, Lisp, X, Motif, Mosaic required.

Note: This is a contractor position, not a civil servant position. Green Card
or US citizenship is required.

HELP MAKE HIGH-LEVEL COMPUTING WORK!


The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center has three openings as part of a
project exploring new techniques to make it possible for programmers to
write very high-level, modular code without sacrificing performance.
Our approach is based on domain specific implementation guidance coupled
with advanced general purpose techniques including: meta-level
protocols, partial evaluation, and run-time code generation.

The project methodology is based on collaborating with other PARC
researchers to develop solutions to their specific software development
needs, and then, over time, generalizing those solutions into more
broadly applicable tools and techniques.

We are looking for renaissance computer scientists with experience in
several of the following areas: language techniques such as partial
evaluation, program synthesis and run-time code generation; modern OS
architectures; modern hardware architectures; object-oriented
programming, high-level programming languages (e.g. LISP, SML, etc) and
computational reflection.

While no one candidate will have all of the above skills, all candidates
must have exceptional software building skills; they must be able to
understand and implement complex techniques, and rapidly evolve and
redesign those implementations based on experience with them.
Candidates also need the personal skills required to work with other
researchers who will be making day-to-day use of the systems we will be
developing.  One of these positions may involve project management
responsibility as well.

Applicants should send a resume and 2 letters of recommendation to:

email:         gregor@parc.xerox.com
FAX:           +1 415-812-4334

================================================================
			 Positions Available
				  in
		     Applied Research at Bellcore

The Computer Graphics and Interactive Media group within the Applied
Research Area of Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) has up to
three full-time programming positions available for terms of from 1 to
2 years.

If you believe you fit the descriptions of any of the positions below,
please send a resume (ascii-preferred or postscript) and any helpful
supporting materials to:

		sagres@bellcore.com

It will likely take us at least a month to sort through all the
resumes, so please be patient. Also, if you would include where you
saw this message, it will help us for future postings.

THE POSITIONS.

* The first position involves converting a research prototype into a
product-quality piece of software.  The application involves
management and visualization of workflow information and makes novel
use of graphical parsing methods.  The work is in Macintosh Common
Lisp, and requires lisp and Macintosh toolkit experience.  Experience
with http and html is a plus. We are looking for someone who can work
independently and can take on some of the interface design work along
with the implementation.  Flexible arrangements w.r.t. relocation are
possible.

* The second position requires the skills of a mutifaceted software
magician.  We have a system that is suffering growing pains. It
originally was written in Emacs lisp (elisp) with side help from
commonlisp, and some C and C++ programs.  Parts of it have been
rewritten, but more help is needed. Your job will be to rationalize
the code, and build new features. This is a very exciting piece of
software (hint: useful skills include TCP/IP and HTTP and protocol
hacking). Experience on Silicon Graphics machines, and Unix is
critical.

* The last positon requires graphics and interface skills. This work will
be on Silicon Graphics, and requires knowledge of OpenGl, and Inventor.
You will be supporting researchers trying to find new paradigms for 
user interfaces. Experience with interface design is a plus. This work
will be in C, C++ and probably some variant lisp as well.

In the past, positions like these were filled by students who had
finished their Bachelors or Masters degrees, looking for a couple of
years employment in a world class advanced R&D laboratory before going
back for their Ph.D. The candidates we are looking for are smart,
independent, and highly capable as programmers, preferably having
completed significant projects.

The real job description for all of these positions is to help us get
the work done. They will involve an eclectic and creative mix of
talents.  Our lab is an exciting, collaborative place, where people
pitch in, so there are many opportunities to do exciting things.

ABOUT BELLCORE.

Bellcore is the $1B/yr telecommunications research and development
consortium owned by the seven regional phone companies.  It is a piece
of the old Bell Telephone Laboratories, split off at AT&T divestiture
in 1984.  Our group is in the Applied Research area, which comprises about
10% of the company, where the mission is to do strategic research and
visionary development to support the national information and
telecommunication future that is so important to our owners.
We do a range of world class work here, from prototype development to
producing papers for conferences, and generally getting science into
Bellcore's next generation software and telecommunications products.

The WWW home page for our group is http://community.bellcore.com.  It
is, as always, under construction but it may give you some idea of
the interests of the people in our research group.

Cycorp is seeking enthusiastic, highly-motivated multi-talented people
for positions in software development, ontological engineering, and
natural language processing.   Each of these involves working with and
extending the Cyc technology -- an immense, broad, multi-contextual
knowledge base and inference engine which our group has developed over
the last eleven years.  Cyc already contains a useful selection of
fundamental human knowledge:  facts, rules of thumb, and heuristics for
reasoning about the objects and events of modern everyday life.  Cyc
enables a multitude of knowledge-intensive products and services which
could revolutionize the way in which people use and interact with
computers, and Cycorp is dedicated to making this happen.  To date, Cyc
has made possible ground-breaking pilot applications in the areas of
heterogeneous database browsing and integration, captioned image
retrieval, and natural language processing.   We are looking for a few
individuals to join us in this challenging enterprise.


Software Development
--------------------
o C applications programming expertise (Unix, Macintosh, PC)
o Preferably some Common Lisp programming experience
o Database theory and application development (Oracle, DB2)
o Formal logic (predicate calculus) and deductive theorem proving
o Inference engine design, implementation, and maintenance


Ontological Engineering
-----------------------
o Facility with formal logic (predicate calculus)
o Preferably some background in AI, esp. knowledge representation
o Programming ability is a plus, but not required


Natural Language Processing
---------------------------
o Familiarity with NL parsing theory (including statistical 
  and/or corpus-based parsing methods and other methods)
o Experience in designing, building, and extending parsers
o Facility with predicate calculus, and some knowledge of
  mathematical methods in linguistics
o Familiarity with linguistic theory, esp. morphology and syntax;
  knowledge of pragmatics and/or discourse theory a plus
o Ability to think procedurally and concretely (thus, programming
  skills would be a plus)

Canadian citizens may be eligible for a TN-1 visa (Treaty NAFTA).  Some of
the requirements for a TN-1 visa include:
     - proof of identification and citizenship (a valid Canadian passport
       is recommmended)
     - proof of a degree or diploma from a recognized post-secondary
       institution (expect to present the degree/diploma and a copy of
       your transcript)
     - a minimum of three years work experience in the IT industry
     - a letter of offer from a US company
     - $50.00 in US funds

The TN-1 visa should not be confused with an Alien Card (or "Green Card")
since the TN-1 visa has additional restrictions.  If you are a Canadian
citizen and would like to apply, we recommend that you first contact the
nearest branch of US Immigration & Naturalization Services (INS) to obtain
more detailed information on the TN-1 visa.

Please do not send electronic mail to this ID since I am not the recruiter
for CAP Gemini.  Thanks for reading!
