               Member of Technical Staff
                  POSITION  AVAILABLE

MCC is one of the nation's leading technology development and 
commercialization consortia.  Its mission is to strengthen and 
sustain the competitiveness of its nearly 100 member organizations 
and customers that share common technical and product requirements 
in electronics and information technology.  MCC conducts a wide 
range of activities intended to accelerate the development and 
commercialization of advanced technology in the areas of advanced 
electronic systems, information management, intelligent systems, 
and distributed systems management.

The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) is 
a research and development consortium serving the electronics and 
computer industries. Our focus is information technologies and 
advanced electronics. With a membership and customer base of 
nearly 100 corporations, public and non-profit agencies, and 
universities, MCC provides a forum where industry, government 
and academia can collaborate, leveraging investments - and 
expertise - in the development of high-risk, high-impact technology 
while reducing costly duplication of efforts. This collaborative 
environment provides an opportunity to cooperate on projects that 
are inherently multi-company or multi-industry. 

The specific opportunity available is described below:

             InfoSleuth:  Networked Exploitation 
             of Information using Semantic Agents
                 Member of Technical Staff 

PROJECT SUMMARY 

InfoSleuth is developing and deploying new technologies for
finding information in both corporate and external networks, 
such as those based on the emerging National Information 
Infrastructure (NII).  The InfoSleuth research is based on 
MCC's acclaimed Carnot technology, developed in a collaborative 
project over the last 4 years.  Carnot has been successfully 
used to integrate heterogeneous corporate information
resources.  The InfoSleuth Project will investigate the use 
of Carnot technology in a more dynamically changing environment, 
such as the Internet, where new information sources are 
constantly being added and for which there is no formal control 
of the registration of new information sources.  In this type 
of environment, traditional techniques for expressing and optimizing 
database queries are inadequate because of the rapidly changing 
schema information and the fuzzy nature of the queries. InfoSleuth 
will build on Carnot's semantic modeling capabilities to enable 
"deep" descriptions of available information sources, and 
InfoSleuth will deploy intelligent agents to carry out distributed, 
coordinated, self-adapting search algorithms.

More information on Carnot and InfoSleuth can be found on the 
World Wide Web at:

THE OPPORTUNITY

To participate in challenging research aimed at constructing 
practical solutions for finding, accessing, browsing, investigating, 
and updating information residing in a distributed system of 
structured (data bases) and unstructured (text documents) 
information sources. The specific problems are: integration of 
DBs based on semantic domain models, data mining, document retrieval 
and extraction of information from text. The work is conducted in 
the form of application partnerships with organizations funding 
the project. This collaboration grounds the research in real 
problems encountered at large companies and institutions.

The position involves programming in various languages (some of 
them non-orthodox) and working on systems (design and implementation) 
consisting of many different components of two types: commercially 
available ones and those developed within the framework of the project.

QUALIFICATIONS

Excellent programming skills (on the designing and coding levels), 
a passion towards programming, and the tendency to view work more 
as a source of pleasure and happiness than as a routine duty are 
the most valuable qualifications expected.  Specific languages 
include, but are not limited to:
                                 - C++
                                 - Tcl/Tk
                                 - Lisp

Require knowledge and experience in more than one of the 
following areas:
         - modeling of information and knowledge representation
         - databases
         - natural language processing
         - developing graphical interfaces

Master's in Computer Science or Computer Engineering required.
