I have a Programmer position and a Research Associate position available
starting this summer for someone to work with us on our knowledge
representation and reasoning projects in the Knowledge Systems Lab at
Stanford University (http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/).  We currently have
projects in DARPA's High Performance Knolwedge Base (HPKB) program and
Rapid Design Exploration and Optimization (RaDEO) program, and have
proposals pending to NSF's Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence (KDI)
program.  A paper describing our current vision and research directions
in the HPKB
program is available at
http://ksl-web.stanford.edu/KSL_Abstracts/KSL-97-02.html.

The programmer position is to work with James Rice in building our
large-scale intelligent system prototypes.  Our primary implementation
languages are LISP and JAVA, and we typically provide HTML/JAVA user
interfaces for our systems and make them available for use via the Web. 
(See our Ontolingua system as an example;
http://ontolingua.stanford.edu.)  Our programmers are substantive
participants in our research activities and co-author many of our
publications. 

If you are interested in this position, send me your resume information.

Richard Fikes
Co-Scientific Director, Knowledge Systems Laboratory
Professor (Research) Computer Science
