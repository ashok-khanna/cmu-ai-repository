Several programmer/analysts are needed in the Los Angeles area:

Experience in C/C++ and LISP is a must.  Familiarity with any two of the
following will enhance your candidacy: agent-based AI, OLE, DDE, Visual
Basic (esp. v4.0), Oracle.

This is an excellent opportunity to work on exciting new technologies
and their application. The ideal candidate will have excellent critical 
thinking skills, a willingness to defy "common wisdom" with elegant 
alternatives, an ability to think outside of the box and an enthsiastic 
commitment to excellence.  DAZ hires only the best.

If you qualify and are interested, please reply with you TEXT ONLY resume 
to langill@cyberspace.com--include a daytime phone number and be prepared 
to offer samples of your past work.

I look forward to hearing from you.
