High Tech company in MD is searching for people working on site Nasa/Goddard 
in Greenbelt area with following qualification:

Experience with Lisp/CLOS (industrial preferred, academic will be
considered).  As far as I'm concerned, this is the big one -
non-Lisp-enthusiasts need not apply.

Experience with AI programming (planning/scheduling preferred). 
Design/maintenance on at least one non-trivial application.

Unix experience a plus; experience with other computer languages outside
the Lisp family a plus.

A BS in something technical is the bare minimum here, and more education
is better.

Please send you resume and salary requirement to kttech@access.digex.net. 
Or fax to: 301-552-2638
