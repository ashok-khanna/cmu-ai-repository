                         RESEARCH PROGRAMMER POSITION

             The Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor (PACT) Center
                         Carnegie Mellon University

The PACT Center at CMU is developing cognitive computer tutors for high
school mathematics.  We have developed and successfully deployed the
PUMP Algebra Tutor in three city high schools in conjunction with the
Pittsburgh Urban Math Project.

A full-time programmer is needed to assist in developing and evaluating
a cognitive computer tutor for 10th-grade math.  This tutor will
emphasize inductive and deductive reasoning in problem solving contexts,
with emphasis on geometry and statistics.

Responsibilities will include

  * programming a production system cognitive model of problem solving
      and mathematics knowledge,
  * problem-solving interface development,
  * data analysis, and
  * assistance in deploying and maintaining the computer tutors. 

BS or equivalent in cognitive science, cognitive psychology or computer
science and AI programming experience in Lisp is required.  Cognitive
modeling experience, production system programming, or prior job
experience in cognitive science research is desireable. 

The initial appointment is for one-year, but additional years are
anticipated.  We would like to hire immediately, although we can wait as
long as May for a particularly strong candidate.

Please send resumes to Albert Corbett (email:  corbett @cmu.edu, FAX:
268-5576, or Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon
University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213).
