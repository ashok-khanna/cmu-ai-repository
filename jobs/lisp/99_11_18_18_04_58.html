Subject: JOB in Pittsburgh: Intelligent tutoring system development

Sender: ai+@ux4.sp.cs.cmu.edu

The Andes project (http://www.pitt.edu/~vanlehn/andes.html) seeks a
Research
Associate and a Research Programmer/Analyst to help us develop an
intelligent tutoring system for physics.  The researchers filling these
positions will be involved in developing hybrid knowledge acquisition
tools.
The Andes project incorporates many recently developed AI technologies,
including Bayesian networks, reactive planning, robust parsing and
ontological engineering.  Andes project members learn via first-hand
experience about these state-of-the-art technologies while helping push
the
technology in their particular area beyond the state of the art.  Andes
is
written in Lisp, C++ and CLIPS, and may soon have a module written in
Prolog.  Versions of Andes have been used by hundreds of students since
1997.  These pilot tests have revealed surprising new directions for
extending it. 

For the Research Associate position, a PhD in Computer Science or a
related
field is required.  For the Research Programmer/Analyst position,
coursework
in AI and substantial system development experience are required.
Experience with intelligent tutoring systems or intelligent help systems
is
a strong plus.  Knowledge of physics is unnecessary but welcome
nonetheless.  

Both positions are funded by long-term research grants and are available
immediately.  The initial contract will be for 1 year, with extensions
contingent upon satisfactory performance during the first year.  The
Andes
project is part of CIRCLE (http://www.pitt.edu/~circle/), an NSF-funded
research center for the study of tutoring.  

If interested, please contact me at the address below as soon as
possible.
