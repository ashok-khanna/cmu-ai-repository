The Artificial Intelligence Group and the Machine Learning Systems
Group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of
Technology are seeking candidates at the BA/BS, MA/MS and PhD level to
work on fundamental research problems leading to unique software
applications in spacecraft autonomy, scientific data analysis, and
mission operations automation.

Openings in the following areas of artificial intelligence research and
development exist:  planning & scheduling, intelligent systems monitoring and
diagnosis, machine learning / data mining, and pattern recognition / image
understanding.  Responsibilities for these openings range from research
program development to software design and coding.

Candidates must hold a degree in Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering or a related area, and must possess programming skills in
C and/or LISP, as well as have some experience with the UNIX
environment.  Ideally, in addition to a background in artificial
intelligence, a candidate would also have a background in one or more
of the following areas: statistics, applied mathematics, signal
processing, operations research, economics, or image processing.

Some of the new application targets for AI-based software onboard
spacecraft include mission planning and resource management, adaptive
feature detection for science, fault management, artificial economies,
and agent-based architectures.  Some ongoing applications include
automated planning of image analysis for the Galileo mission to
Jupiter, automated procedure generation for the Deep Space Network,
automated anomaly detection in Space Shuttle telemetry, automated sky
object catalog generation from Mt. Palomar Observatory data, and
automated volcano detection in Venus synthetic-aperture radar images
returned by the Magellan spacecraft.  This work has generated new
research results on the path towards unprecedented AI applications.

If you are interested in applying for one of these positions, please send a
resume and any other supporting materials to the address below (electronic
submission of resumes encouraged).  Please include an e-mail address and
phone number at which you can be reached.  Recent graduates are strongly
encouraged to apply.  Please include information on your citizenship status
with your application.
