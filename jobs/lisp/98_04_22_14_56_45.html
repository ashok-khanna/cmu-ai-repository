Software Developer Profile
Overview:
ESI Client's Software Developers are the architects of ESI Client's product.
They are the best and brightest in the field and strive to exploit the
industries latest technology to build the best products for our customers.

ESI Client's Software Developers work on small teams, take ownership of
entire products and work in a fast-paced deadline-driven environment.  They
also work closely with our marketing, consulting, and pre-sales
organizations to define and develop the best product for our customers.
Technical Skills
Software Developers are ESI Client's deepest technical resources.  They keep
current with all the latest technologies and incorporate the best ones in
their product design.  They must be extremely talented software designers as
well as coders since they will typically have responsibility for an entire
product.

Software Developers should have at least 2-4 years of experience with the
following technologies in commercial product development situations
(experience from internal products or  "on their own time" is less
valuable):

* C++
* Java
* Visual Basic (other visual RAD tool like Delphi, PowerBuilder, and
VisualAge are potential substitutes)
* GUI development in any language (Visual Basic, MFC, Java/AWT, etc.)
* Component technologies (ActiveX, Java Beans)
* SQL and experience with relational database design and development
(Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB/2, SQL Server)
* COM/DCOM/OLE, CORBA, and RMI
* Web technologies (HTML, SSL, Active Server Pages)

Software Developers need to have had experience in the following technical
subjects in commercial product development situations  (experience from
internal products or  "on their own time" is less valuable):

* Object Oriented Design (Booch, Rumbaugh, UML etc.)
* Relational Database schema modeling and design
* Client Server application design (two-tier and three-tier)
* Development Process Tools (compilers, profilers, version control systems,
automated testing tools)

Professional Skills:
Software Developers need to possess the appropriate level of professional
experience to communicate with our marketing, consulting, and pre-sales
organizations about product direction and design.  They also need to be able
to function in a fast-paced development environment and be able to balance
tight schedules with high levels of quality.

ESI Client's Software Developers need to have the following qualities

* Strong technical communication skills
* Goal and deadline oriented
* Able to balance multiple development projects

Culture
ESI Client's culture has been and always will be "Whatever it takes."  There
is no exception when it comes to our Software Developers.  They must be
willing to participate in all aspects of the development process from design
to implementation, to testing.

We are looking for driven people who want to have an immediate effect on ESI
Client's product direction.  ESI Client is a place where products are
developed and brought to market rapidly and we need software developers who
are excited about this fast-paced environment.

Typical Employment History
ESI Client's Software Developers typically come from the following
backgrounds:
* Software developers with large software firms.  The important aspect will
be in their desire to work in a less structured, competitive, environment
where they are rewarded directly for their contributions.
* Software developers with small software firms.  The start-up mentality and
energy that pervades at these companies fits in well with ESI Client's
culture.
? Software developers from research consortiums.  ESI Client needs people
with a desire to produce product, so it is imperative that we find only the
ones that have a strong desire to move on from their research-oriented work.
