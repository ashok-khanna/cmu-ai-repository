Two 3 year research associate posts are available to work on on
an EPSRC funded project looking at the use of text planning
and user modelling techniques in the provision of interactive
personalised health education materials. The starting dates
will be negotiable, but will be between October 1995 and April 1996.

One post is available on the UK RA 1A scale (around 16000 pa,
according to age and experience), and the other on the RA 1B
scale (around 14300 pa). Candidates for the 1A post will normally
have a higher degree in a relevant area, and will be expected to
work mainly on the development of the techniques for the appropriate
selection and presentation of interactive personalised
health information. The ideal candidate would have experience
in Lisp programming, and in developing practical natural language
generation or explanation systems.

Candidates for the 1B post will normally have 
a good honours degree in Computing Science or a Health related
area, and preferably an MSc in a relevant area (e.g., HCI, AI, Medical
Informatics or Public Health). Some medical knowledge would be
an advantage, but is not essential. The 1B RA  will be expected to 
collaborate with health professionals in the development and evaluation 
of prototype systems. There may be opportunities to register for a higher 
degree.

The closing date for applications is 1st September.

Some further details of the posts and the project are
available from "http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~alison/job.html"
or by emailing alison@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk.

Letters of application should be sent together with a copy of a recent
CV to:

        Dr Alison Cawsey,
        Department of Computing Science,
        University of Glasgow,
        Glasgow, G12 8QQ.
