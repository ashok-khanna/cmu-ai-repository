AI Research Positions at SRI International

The Representation and Reasoning group within the Artificial Intelligence
Center at SRI International is accepting applications for the 
position in the area of intelligent, real time management of complex,
dynamic processes.

Research Engineer -- We are looking for an experienced programmer to assist
with the development of next-generation AI software tools and applications
related to reactive control, planning, and scheduling. The ideal candidate
will have broad familiarity with AI and experience in developing AI
technologies.  Strong background in Common Lisp programming is required;
experience with Java, C, C++, and CLIM are also desirable.  Familiarity with
Unix and Windows is important.  A B.S. or M.S. in computer science or
related field is required.


Artificial Intelligence Center at SRI International

SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center (AIC), located in Menlo
Park, California, is one of the world's major centers for research in
artificial intelligence. Founded in 1966, the AIC has been a pioneer and a
major contributor to the development of computer capabilities for
intelligent behavior in complex situations. Its objectives are to understand
the computational principles underlying intelligence in man and machines and
to develop methods for building computer-based systems to solve problems, to
communicate with people, and to perceive and interact with the physical
world.

The AIC is an integral part of a not-for-profit research institute, and
focuses on comprehensive long-term research and development programs in
reasoning, natural language and speech understanding, perception, and
robotics. The Center provides the stimulation and creative exchange of ideas
characteristic of an academic setting by maintaining associations with
universities and other research groups and by providing opportunities for
students and visiting fellows to participate in ongoing projects.

The AIC maintains a staff of approximately 50 professionals, supplemented by
international visitors and students. Approximately 80% of these
professionals have a Ph.D., reflecting its commitment to conducting basic
research and developing ground-breaking applications. Additional information
about the AIC can be found at http://www.ai.sri.com/.

The Representation and Reasoning program within the AIC conducts basic and
applied research in a wide range of AI topics.  Current research strengths
include:

    Reactive planning and control
    Fuzzy control
    Generative planning
    Evidential reasoning
    Automated deduction
    Knowledge browsing and editing
    Agent architectures
    Distributed reasoning

As part of its research efforts the group has developed several important
software tools (PRS, SIPE, Gister, SEAS, OKBC, GKB-Editor, Saphira) that
support its research and greatly aid in the application of its technical
results to new problems.

 Applicants should submit the following information:
   -  a resume or curriculum vitae
   -  names and phone numbers or email addresses for three references
   -  desired start date

Applications and requests for additional information should be directed to:

  Dr. Thomas D. Garvey, Associate Director
  AI Center
  SRI International
  333 Ravenswood Avenue
  Menlo Park, CA  94025
