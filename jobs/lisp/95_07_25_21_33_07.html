DylanWorks at Harlequin

The software industry needs a new programming language 
like a whole in the head.

But this one is different.  Dylan delivers what others promised.  The
best of component-based technology, the efficiency of static languages
and the flexibility of dynamic languages.  With very tight
executables.

We take it very seriously.  Which is why we showed our Dylan
technology at Apple's WWDC.  And promised to deliver product in 1996.

And we are making it work for real.  Across standard platforms
. . . From Windows to MacOS to UNIX and to PDAs.  OLE2 
and OpenDoc . . . compilers, programming environments and
applications.

If you are good enough for the ultimate software challenge, use your
expertise in software development to help us turn a great idea into an
every day reality.

You could work for us on the West Coast, East Coast, in England, or
Australia.  You would have the opportunity to travel and work with
some of the world's greatest software developers.  At Harlequin.

Harlequin is an equal opportunity employer.  This is your opportunity
to join a world-class team.
