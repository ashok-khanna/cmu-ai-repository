Techwriters,

I am looking for a contract writer who can develop documentation for a 
Lisp-based product for the Web. You should have experience creating on-line 
software documentation, familiarity with Lisp, and Web savvy. 

Product development is under way in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Please send email to Jim Lidington at jimlid@auratek.com if you are interested.

-Jim
