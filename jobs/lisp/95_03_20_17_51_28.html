The Proteus Project at New York University invites inquiries regarding
a full-time research position in computational linguistics for the
1995-96 year (starting September 1995 or before).  The Project is
involved in combining traditional, linguistically-based analysis
methods with statistically-based corpus methods to improve on the
state of the art in several areas of natural language processing,
including document retrieval (IR), information extraction, machine
translation, and language modeling for speech understanding.  We
currently have 5 full-time research staff pursuing research in all
these areas, with funding from ARPA, NSF, and the Linguistic Data
Consortium.

Applicants should have good programming skills (Lisp and C preferred),
a knowledge of statistical training methods, and experience in
applying computational linguistics techniques.  Applicants should have
a proven research record as demonstrated through publications.  An
M.S. is required; a Ph.D. is preferred.

Please send resume (including list of publications) to grishman@cs.nyu.edu
or by mail to
     Prof. Ralph Grishman
     Computer Science Department
     New York University
     715 Broadway, 7th Floor
     New York, NY 10003
