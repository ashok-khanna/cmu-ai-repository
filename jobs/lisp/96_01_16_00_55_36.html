<WE ARE NOT A RECRUITING COMPANY>

Hello!!

We are looking for CLOS expertise.  1-2 FT positions available
to assist in re-tooling and managing the re-tooling of a small
line of products currently in LISP.  The team may initially be
located in Geneva (at least there is a high probability of this)
for a period of about 1 year.  After this, relocation to the US
will be possible.  (It's possibly we may locate in Mpls, Atlanta, or
Phoenix as opposed to Geneva... we will know within 30 days.)
We are looking for someone to start in roughly the June timeframe.

Initial responsibilities will include:

* Participation in architectural design with small design team
* Component Integration
* Participation in the supervision of other programming teams
    implementing the design
* Coding, Code optimization, and Validation

The following is required:

 o Extensive experience in OOA/OOD Methodologies & ACTUAL medium to
   large scale project use, (no distaste for FUSION method :) )

 o Proficiency in CLOS

 o Must be highly motivated, and enjoy working as a team member

 o Since we are working as a team, relocation is also required.

In addition, these skills are desired:

 * Windows/NT
 * UNIX expertise
 * Other Platforms
 * Database implementations/concepts, e.g., transaction systems,
   distributed communications, etc.  


If you want to play a key role with great future potential please contact me
(preferably with a resume and references available on request).  We can also
discuss more details on who we are, employee benefits (e.g. stock options),
etc.

Sincerely,

Paul.
