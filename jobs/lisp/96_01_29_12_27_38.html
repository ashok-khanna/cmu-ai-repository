JOBS AVAILABLE:

2 COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTS

We are looking for two - preferably postdoctoral - research assistants to
work on the CEC-funded LRE project SPARKLE in collaboration with groups in
Pisa, Stuttgart, Sharp (UK), and Daimler (Germany) on `Shallow parsing and
(lexical) knowledge extraction for language engineering'.

Applicants should be able to program in Lisp and/or C and have knowledge
of research in statistical and/or unification/constraint-based
computational linguistics. Our component of the research involves further
development of a robust statistical parsing system and of a system for
acquiring lexical information about the argument structure of predicates
from textual corpora utilising the robust parser.

Applicants will be paid on a scale commensurate with RA(1A) (salary 15986
UK pounds at age 27) and should be able to start full-time work on the
project between July and October 1996, for a period of 2-3 years. One post
will be based at Sussex (Brighton) and one at Cambridge. The grant
includes provision for project and conference travel. Further details can
be obtained by email from the grant-holders, below. Applications should be
submitted via email and should include a latex source/postscript CV and
the names and email addresses of three referees.
