The New Millennium Program (NMP) is a new NASA initiative to develop and
demonstrate technology which will revolutionize space exploration.  One
major thrust in this program is the development of highly autonomous ground
and on-board control systems for Earth-orbiting and deep space satellites.

We currently have a number of openings at NASA Ames to work on the
development of an AI-based on-board control system for the NMP's first Deep
Space Mission (DS-1).  DS-1 will launch in 1998 and conduct a fly-by of an
asteroid and a comet.  It will be the first satellite controlled using
on-board AI planner/scheduler, reactive execution system, and model-based
diagnosis and recovery.  For energetic people interested in applying AI to
solve challenging real-world problems, this is the opportunity of a
lifetime.

We have two openings to work on the reactive execution system.  This is a
core AI engine in the autonomous spacecraft, which decomposes high-level
plans into primitive control and hardware commands and interfaces with a
monitoring and diagnosis system to ensure successful achievement of the
plan.  The positions involve design and coding of the execution system,
interfacing with domain experts to acquire requirements and models, and
developing and testing those models within the overall architecture.  The
position also presents opportunities to collaborate on a number of research
publications in this area.

Candidates for this position must hold a degree in Computer Science,
Electrical Engineering or a related area, and must possess programming
skills in C and LISP, as well as have some experience with the UNIX
environment.  Strong social skills, a desire to be part of a team, and high
energy are key requirements.  Familiarity with AI technologies and ability
to make frequent trips to the Los Angeles area are pluses.  Salaries are
determined by the qualifications of the applicant.

Only US citizens or Green card holders are eligible for this position.

Caelum Research Corporation is a sub-contractor at NASA Ames research center
in the south San Francisco Bay area.  To apply, email a cover letter and
resume' (ASCII or postscript only) to allen@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov.  Please
label all correspondence "DS1-EXEC".

If you do not have access to email, a hard copy can be sent to:
