Cycorp is seeking an enthusiastic, multi-talented person for a position
in software development for database applications.  This will involve
working with the Cyc technology -- an immense, broad, multi-contextual
knowledge base and inference engine which our group has developed over
the last twelve years.  Cyc contains facts and rules of thumb for
reasoning about the objects and events of modern everyday life.  Cyc
enables a multitude of knowledge-intensive products and services which
could revolutionize the way in which people use and interact with data,
and Cycorp is dedicated to making this happen.  Cyc currently supports
ground-breaking pilot applications in the areas of heterogeneous
database browsing and integration, captioned image retrieval, and
natural language understanding.   We are looking for a self-motivated
individual with significant database experience to join us in this
challenging enterprise.  Specifically, the individual chosen should have
significant experience and expertise in:

o Database and compiler theory
o Formal logic (predicate calculus) and deductive theorem proving
o Database programming and administration (Oracle, DB2, others)
o C and Lisp application programming expertise
o Expertise in UNIX, Macintosh, and Windows operating systems


For immediate consideration, send your resume and a cover letter to:
