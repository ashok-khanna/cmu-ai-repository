Intelligent Handbook has developed software for managing, preparing and 
retrieving legal documents and data, particularly in the field of customs 
administration. The software, which is currently in use for projects in 
Denmark and the European Union, uses advanced techniques for text 
processing and text management based on SGML/HTML as well as 
object-oriented database storage and User Interface management. The final 
objective is to provide decision support systems for customs 
administrations and traders.

The basic tools in use are Allegro Common Lisp including the CLOS object 
standard, SQL databases, Textual Search databases and CORBA middleware 
(planned).

Employees for the following tasks are required in connection with a 2 1/2 
year project in Poland. Similar projects in other countries are expected to 
follow.

Applicants from Poland or secondarily, Denmark or Belgium interested in 
spending some time in Poland, will be preferred. It is expected that 
applicants have a university degree in Computer Science.

The following technical areas need staffing:

Text processing including SGML- and non-SGML parsing, development of text 
browsers and text management tools.

User interface development using the Common Graphics tools of Allegro 
Common Lisp.

Basic tools development for SQL extensions using CORBA.
