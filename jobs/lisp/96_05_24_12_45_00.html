Research and Development Unit for English Studies

PhD applications are invited from good Honours graduates with a
background in linguistics and, ideally, also in computerised lexical
description and computing for linguistic purposes. A studentship is
available for a 3-year period, starting in autumn 1996, to work with
the Unit in its research.

Unit activities involve the development and exploitation of systems
with relevance to the fields of information technology and linguistic
description. It is currently envisaged that the studentship will focus
on the exploitation phase of a system which automatically extracts
thesaural information from text, although alternatives may emerge in
other areas.

A CV detailing relevant experience and research interests should be
sent to:
