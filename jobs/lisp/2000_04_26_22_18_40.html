Department:  GoTo.com Shopping - Search Engines Group
 
Job Description:
 
GoTo.com operates a free web-based product comparison and shopping 
service on the Internet. The core technology is based on a 
proprietary information integration engine. The engine provides 
almost instantaneous feature-level comparisons to the end-users, as 
well as  being used to unify disparate product specifications across 
manufacturers. This junior software engineer will become responsible

the data feed process. They may also be responsible for other aspects 
of the Search Engines group's work, which includes a text search 
process and various build and integration issues.
 
Required Experience/Education:
 
0-2 years post-academic programming experience (any language) in a 
Unix environment is  required. Experience in writing Shell scripts or 
other scripting languages is a plus.
 
Some (at least academic) exposure to, and a like for:  LISP, Logic 
Programming, Expert Systems, SQL.
   
Some knowledge of web languages and protocols such as  HTML, HTTP, and XML.
   
BS in Computer Science is a plus. A semester course on AI, and on 
database technology would probably qualify you for the background we 
need.
