	Princeton Capital is a national commercial finance company. Princeton Capital,
and sister companies Princap Mortgage Warehouse (PMW) and Financial Support Services
Inc.  (FSSI) together finance about $ .3 Billion in assets. Based on current rates of
growth, we expect to pass the $ 1 Billion mark by sometime in next year.

	Princeton Capital is headquartered in 25,000 sq ft of space, approximately 1
mile from the Princeton campus. The company and its affiliates employ just over 100
people. 

	Our asset based financing operation is supported by custom lisp software running
on Symbolics equipment. The system supports about 15 individuals, divided into small
groups performing a range of services including: a) telephone based client account
management; b) payment processing; c) credit and underwriting; and d) accounting, audit
reporting and document creation. The system tracks and controlls the movement of about $
5 Million per day. Each user has a PC which sits on a novell network and runs (at least)
an X Server. The Princeton office runs a 100 user novell licence.

	The Lisp programming environment in Princeton includes 3 Symbolics XL1200
machines (40-bit custom design) and an SGI workstation. Princeton capital has invested
substantially in Symbolics technology, including the Virtual Lisp Machine (VLM) product,
called Open Genera, which runs on the 64-bit DEC Alpha.

	We are interested in discussing opportunities for full time work with interested
and qualified individuals. You should have a stong desire to develop applications in
lisp and a solid background with as much experience as possible. A degree in computer
science, with several years experience is the minimum requirement, there is no upper
limit on qualifications. As much previous work with Symbolics equipment as possible is
desired. We offer very competitive salary and bonus packages commensurate with ability.
