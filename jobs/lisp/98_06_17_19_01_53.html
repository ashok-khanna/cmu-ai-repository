AI RESEARCH PROGRAMMER FOR INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM PROJECT

We are looking for a research programmer to assist in the 
development of intelligent tutoring systems as part of the CIRCLE 
project. CIRCLE, the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on 
Constructive Learning Environments, is a National Science 
Foundation-funded research center based at the University of 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie-Mellon University. The goal of the project 
is to develop a new generation of intelligent tutoring systems 
which foster the same kind of learning as one-on-one human 
tutoring. More information on CIRCLE can be found at 
http://www.pitt.edu/~circle.

The ideal candidate would have a B.A. or M.S. in computer 
science and some experience with AI programming, either from 
coursework, research projects or previous employment. Especially 
relevant are planning, reasoning and knowledge representation; 
some experience with natural language processing would be a plus.

Duties will largely consist of analysis and programming in 
Common Lisp, primarily the creation and testing of complex data 
structures. The work also includes C/C++ programming and use of 
the Windows API to support our GUI and perform other miscellaneous
programming tasks.

We are looking for an excellent programmer who writes in a 
simple yet consistent style, understands the importance of 
thoroughness and organization in testing, and can cope with the 
necessary complexities of working on a large, active project. 
Flexibility, creativity, enthusiasm, and an interest in AI are 
essential, as are the ability to follow directions, meet deadlines
and communicate with other staff members.

This project is part of the Learning Research and Development of 
the University of Pittsburgh. For more information about the 
LRDC or the University of Pittsburgh, see http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu 
or http://www.pitt.edu, respectively. We have a friendly, flexible 
work environment in a pleasant area of Pittsburgh, one of the 
U.S.'s most livable cities. The University of Pittsburgh has an 
excellent benefits program, including health insurance, retirement 
benefits and tuition reduction.

This is a full-time, permanent position. It is not a research position.

If you are interested, please send a cover letter describing your 
interests and background, along with a resume, salary history and 
references, to:

Reva Freedman
LRDC #819
3939 O'Hara St.
University of Pittsburgh
