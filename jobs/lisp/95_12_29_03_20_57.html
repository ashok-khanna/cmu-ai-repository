Job 794 - Graphics/Visualization Developer (avionics, C, SGI, Lisp, Motif)

Provide programming support for applications, and extensions to, a large
human performance modeling system that provides designers with techniques
for analyzing the human factors implications of their designs. The work
occurs on SGI computers in the C, C++ and LISP programming languages. The
major effort involves tailoring the analysis capabilities of this system to
various application areas, especially for advanced concepts within the
commercial airline domain. The ability to create and use computer-assisted
design (CAD) tools to support geometric modeling in a software simulation
is especially relevant.

Candidate has BS in CS, EE, or related, and 5 years experience (or
equivalent combination) with C, C++ (CAD a plus), SGI or similar UNIX
workstations, familiarity with the UNIX operating system, and domain
knowledge in relevant application. Also prefer experience with OO
