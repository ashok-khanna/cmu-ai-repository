Gensym is a leading provider of software products for developing and
deploying intelligent systems for decision support and control.  Our
flagship product, G2, is a graphical, object-oriented development
environment that helps organizations quickly solve complex, dynamic
problems.  Gensym's commitment to providing best-in-class products
through best-in-class employees has made us one of the world's most
interesting and rewarding software companies.  We are growing and need
qualified people to help manage this growth.

Gensym's Mid-Atlantic Region is in search of an Applications Engineer
in our Washington D.C. area office.  This person will provide
technical sales support for the region and work with Gensym customers
to help them define applications, build prototypes and construct
real-time intelligent systems.  The ideal candidate will have
knowledge of expert systems and experience in telecommunications,
process control, manufacturing automation, C and object-oriented
programming.  Experience with one or more high end software
development environments is desired.  Sales support or technical
support experience is desired but not required.  Experience with
network management systems in the telecommunications industry is a
plus.  The position will complement our existing sales force and will
demand excellent presentation, verbal and written communication
skills.

This is a great job!  It's an opportunity to work with real time AI
systems, visual programming environments, neural networks, databases,
and more in applications ranging from baking cookies to flying on the
space shuttle.  You get to meet some of the world's most interesting
customers and address their hardest problems.  You could be an
evangelist for a productive and fun tool.
