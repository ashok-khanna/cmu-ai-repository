language similar in syntax to LISP. The following capabilities are
supported natively in the language through additional A*E components:
*	Case-based reasoning
*	Database integration
*	TCP/IP Sockets-based inter-process communication
	Other interfaces may be built in C/C++ and linked into an A*E
application.
