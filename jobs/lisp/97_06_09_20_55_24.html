3D modelling and animation package and recent winner of a
Computer Graphics World Innovation Award from CGW
Magazine. 

Nichimen Graphics is always looking for talented people to
join our growing team. We offer a fast-paced but friendly work
environment, excellent salary and benefits, and an
opportunity to work in one of the most exciting industries in
the world. We make 2D and 3D animation tools for the
interactive entertainment developer market. Our customers
are mainly video game developers. Our product is completely
extensible and totally integrated. 

Our offices are located near the beach in Playa del Rey, only
