JOB AVAILABLE:

1 COMPUTATIONAL LINGUIST

We are looking for one - preferably postdoctoral - research assistant
to work on the CEC-funded LRE project SPARKLE in collaboration with
groups in Pisa, Stuttgart, Sharp (UK), Xerox (France), and Daimler
(Germany) on `Shallow parsing and (lexical) knowledge extraction for
language engineering'.

Applicants should be able to program in Lisp and/or C and have knowledge
of research in statistical and/or unification/constraint-based
computational linguistics. Our component of the research involves further
development of a robust statistical parsing system and of a system for
acquiring lexical information about the argument structure of predicates
from textual corpora utilising the robust parser.

Applicants will be paid on a scale commensurate with RA(1A) (salary 15986
UK pounds at age 27) and should be able to start full-time work on the
project between July and October 1996, for a period of 2-3 years. The post
will be based at Cambridge and the research will involve close collaboration
with a second RA at Sussex University. The grant includes provision
for project and conference travel. Further details can be obtained by
email from the first grant-holder, below. Applications should be submitted
via email and should include a latex source/postscript CV and the names
and email addresses of three referees.
