Modeling Consultant Profile

Overview
ESI Client's Modeling Consultants tackle one of the most challenging
conceptual design problems in a ESI Client Deployment - representing the
customer's products and processes within their software environment.
Modeling Consultants will learn ESI Client's configuration, pricing, and
commission products and will concentrate on coding the data and logic for
the systems to use.

The Modeling Consultants are the faces of ESI Client that every customer
will know and by which ESI Client will be judged.  We want every Modeling
Consultant to make such a good impression on their customers that they
receive job offers from them.  Do not misunderstand us, we do not want them
to leave ESI Client, but we do want their skill and capability to be
extremely desirable by their customers.

Technical Skills
Modeling Consultants do not necessarily need to have programming or
development experience although it is recommended.  The most important skill
that their modeling consultants possess is the ability to break down
problems and understand interdependencies. For that reason, we have broken
down this section into two parts - one to describe the skills required for a
Modeling Consultant with a computer science background and another to
describe the skills required for a Modeling Consultant with an engineering
degree.

Modeling Consultants with Computer Science experience:
Modeling Consultants should have at least 2 years of experience in at least
two the following technical areas

* Object Oriented Programming/Design methodologies
* GUI design
* Artificial Intelligence - LISP, Prolog, Computational logic,
Constraint-Solving, Constraint Satisfaction, etc.

Modeling Consultants with General Engineering experience:
Modeling Consultants should have an ME, EE, or IE background and at least
2 - 5 years of experience in the following technical areas

* Product design
* Product assembly/configuration.  Have worked in areas that involve
analysis and design of product assembly processes.
* Product or process modeling with solid modeling, Finite Element Analysis
(FEA), or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software.
* Product support.  Have worked in a position of supporting complicated
products in the field or during the sales process.

Additionally, any programming experience is beneficial, even if it isn't
object-oriented.  It helps to get over the initial coding "hump" when we try
to teach these engineers modeling at ESI Client.

Professional Skills
Modeling Consultants need to possess the appropriate level of professional
experience in order to be immediately effective at handling deployments of
ESI Client projects to their customers.  Some of the skills that are
absolutely necessary are:

* Strong technical communication skills
* Goal and deadline oriented
* Ability to travel up to 80% of the time
* Small to large Project Management capabilities
* Experience working with external customers in a project/deadline situation

Culture
ESI Client's culture has been and always will be "Whatever it takes."  Their
Modeling Consultants must have the kind of personality that takes on new
challenges every day without wavering.  They must be interested in
maintaining and growing their technical skills as well as their professional
skills.  We have no need for consultants that are interested in
concentrating only in the "management" aspects of consulting.

Typical Employment History
Modeling Consultants with Computer Science experience:
* Software developers who have a desire and ability to work with customers
and do customer oriented development
* Technical consultants from Big 6 consulting firms.  Typical consultants
from these sources are not technical enough - we need their most technical
resources.

Modeling Consultants with General Engineering experience:
* Design engineers from companies that specialize in controls design ,
electromechanical controls design, medical equipment design, or commercial
products design
* Consultants or engineers from energy and transportation companies with a
genuine interest in the software industry
* Consultants or engineers from organizations that service mission critical
processes in the energy and transportation companies.  Once again, they
should have a genuine interest in the software industry
