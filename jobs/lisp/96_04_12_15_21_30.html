Gensym is a leading provider of software products for developing and
deploying intelligent systems for decision support and control.  Our
flagship product, G2, is a graphical, object-oriented development
environment that helps organizations quickly solve complex, dynamic
problems.  Gensym's commitment to providing best-in-class products
through best-in-class employees has made us one of the world's most
interesting and rewarding software companies.  We are growing and need
qualified people to help manage this growth.

Gensym's Mid-Atlantic Region is in search of an Applications Engineer
in our Philadelphia area office.  This person will provide technical
sales support for the region and work with Gensym customers to help
them define applications, build prototypes and construct real-time
intelligent systems.  The ideal candidate will have knowledge of
expert systems and experience in process control, telecommunications,
manufacturing automation, C and object-oriented programming.
Experience with one or more high end software development environments
is desired.  Sales support or technical support experience is desired
but not required.  The position will complement our existing sales
force and will demand excellent presentation, verbal and written
communication skills.

This is a great job!  It's an opportunity to work with real time AI
systems, visual programming environments, neural networks, databases,
and more in applications ranging from baking cookies to flying on the
space shuttle.  You get to meet some of the world's most interesting
customers and address their hardest problems.  You could be an
evangelist for a productive and fun tool.
