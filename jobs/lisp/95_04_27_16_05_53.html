Subject: Lisp job opportunity in Spain
Message-ID: <CMM.0.90.4.799002136.pshell@NL.CS.CMU.EDU>
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

  The Cresus financial expert-system group at Union Fenosa in Madrid,
Spain is looking for a good Lisp and user-interface/window programmer to
do some programming work for a couple of months.  If you're interested
in working in Spain for two months starting preferably in May, send a resume
to:

        Pete Shell
        Center for Machine Translation
        Carnegie Mellon University

        or by e-mail to pshell@cmu.edu.


        Experience with CommonLisp and graphical user interfaces
is required.  We are porting our user interface to Allegro Lisp's CLIM
(Common Lisp Interface Manager) which is based on CLOS (Common Lisp
Object System). Knowing Spanish isn't a requirement since most people
here speak some English, although it would certainly help.  If
everything goes well, the contract could be extended into or past the summer.

        Carnegie Mellon and Union Fenosa do not discriminate.  Women and
minorities are encouraged to apply.
