               Research Programmer Position Available

We are looking for a research programmer, knowledgeable in C and LISP,
to work on research on learning and computer-based instruction.   The
two major responsibilities are converting existing intelligent tutors
from a Macintosh to a DOS/Windows environment and writing software to
administer laboratory studies in Mac Environment.  The person will be
supervised  by  John Anderson, professor of  psychology  and computer
science at Carnegie Mellon University.

The  first  task  will involve  occasional travel to San  Antonio  and
interaction with researchers at the  Air  Force Armstrong Laboratories
who will be testing the tutors.  The second task will include relating
research results to the ACT simulation of human cognition.  This is an
excellent  opportunity for  someone  who is  interested  in  gaining a
research  background in cognitive  science  and would like to see such
research have real impact on the world.

Send resumes to Helen Borek, Department of Psychology-BH345C, Carnegie
Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA  15213.  Via email to Helen+@cmu.edu
or via fax at (412) 268-2844.
