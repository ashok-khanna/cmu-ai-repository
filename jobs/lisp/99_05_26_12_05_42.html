The Intelligent Coordination and Logistics Lab (ICLL) at Carnegie
Mellon University seeks applicants for one or more open research
programmer positions to support ongoing projects in the area of
planning and scheduling. The ICLL has long been recongized as a leader
in the development of constraint-based scheduling techniques and
frameworks, and the lab has been engaged in the development of
innovative, AI-based solutions to complex planning and scheduling
problems for many years. Current research spans a broad range of topics
including:


* visualization, analysis and manipulation of plans and schedules,

* collaborative, mixed-initiative scheduling by user and system,

* constraint modeling and reasoning techniques,

* search techniques and heuristics for generation, iterative
improvement and localized  reactive repair of plans and schedules

* delayed-commitment scheduling algorithms and construction of robust
schedules,

* interleaved planning and scheduling,

* distributed, agent-based scheduling frameworks and methodologies, 

* (re)configurable scheduling system architectures


Current projects are investigating these issues and developing
experimental software systems in a number of application domains,
including integrated airlift and tanker mission scheduling, air
campaign planning, manufacturing production management and supply chain
coordination. Research activities range from development of basic
concepts/techniques to experimental system development to technology
hardening and transition.  


The successful candidate must have a B.S. or M.S. Degree in Computer
Science or a related field, demonstrated programming proficiency in
Commonlisp, Java or C++, and familiarity with Unix, NT, and MacOS
operating systems. Prior experience in the area of planning and
scheduling systems is a big plus, as is experience in any of the
following areas:  object-oriented design and programming techniques,
user interface design/development, large system development, and
team-oriented research. Salary is comensurate with experience and
competitive.


Carnegie Mellon University is located in Pittsburgh, PA, a city of
approximately 2 million with a high concentration of cultural and arts
events, a vibrant and growing high technology industry, and quite
reasonable cost of living. Carnegie Mellon University is an Equal
Opportunity Employer.


Interested applicants should send a resume to:
