==============================================================================
Systems Analyst Position: AI applications to Education in Lisp
Coaching, Explanation, etc. in Networked Computer-based Learning Environment
LRDC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position Description:

"Systems Analyst II", full time, 2 year position (assuming adequate
performance during 6 month provisional period) with possible renewal
contingent on funding.  ARPA funded project: "Collaboration, Apprenticeship,
and Critical Discussion: Groupware for Learning," Alan Lesgold, Sandy Katz,
Dan Suthers, and Arlene Weiner principal investigators.  Supervisor: Dan
Suthers. Start in September or October 1995.

The successful candidate will design, implement, and test various applications
of Artificial Intelligence techniques to education, including automated
coaches, problem solvers, explanation facilities, tutoring strategies, and
user modeling techniques. Work will most likely involve writing Common LISP
applications in a Unix environment. The functionality provided by these
applications will be made available by a server to client interfaces
implemented by other programmers on Mac or PC platforms. Hence interaction
with external programs and careful attention to memory management will be
required. Some implementation of AI functionality in other languages suitable
for client platforms may be required in cases where server-based functionality
is infeasible (e.g., for simulation engines which control real-time displays).
Ability to work well with other programmers who will be implementing the
server and user interfaces is essential.  Flexibility and quick response are
requisites, since this project is committed to revision and redesign as
needed, and to producing quick prototypes and usable systems in a relatively
short time.  Robustness of software will be achieved by group design
discussions, empirical testing, and scrutiny and possible revision of code by
others. Lone hackers need not apply.

Minimum Knowledge/Education: M.S. in Computer Science or equivalent
experience.

Minimum Experience Level: Prior experience with Common LISP and Artificial
Intelligence techniques is essential.  Successful participation in a
substantial multi-programmer software project.

Preferred Additional Experience: Prior experience in developing Intelligent
Tutoring Systems. Background in cognitive science, education, or the
psychology of learning.  Experience with CGI and/or client/server
communications.

Salary Range for Systems Analyst II: minimum 25,320, "control point" (beyond
which significant justification is required) 35,460. Excellent benefits.

We are also hiring for two other Systems Analyst positions. We reserve the
right to reallocate assignments and rewrite job descriptions to fit successful
candidates' qualifications and experience. Hence, if your background does not
match this description exactly but you have other experience that may be
relevant, you should read the other job postings.  If there is a match,
indicate in your application that your experience is relevant to a mixture of
the positions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duties, responsibilities, performance standards, and percentages of time:

 PLANNING: 20%
 Meet with project members to design the software and coordinate work with
other aspects of the project.
 Related Performance Standard: Ability to interact well with project members
from diverse backgrounds, including computer scientists, educators, and
psychologists, to evaluate needs, design systems, coordinate implementation,
and coordinate installation of the software in school sites.  Sufficient
understanding of software design techniques and project goals to contribute to
planning and design.

 PROGRAMMING: 50%
 See "Position Description."
 Related Performance Standard: Proficiency in Common Lisp and familiarity with
Artificial Intelligence techniques.  Use of modular, object oriented design
techniques.  Use of a code version control tool.  Be able to manage one's own
software development activities such that prototype modules and subsequent
improvements are available when they are needed for testing by other project
members.  Prioritize tasks and identify and discuss potential problems before
they impact on delivery deadlines.

 TESTING: 20%
 Thorough testing of implemented functionality under a variety of scenarios.
 Related Performance Standard: Ability to maintain test suites and conduct
tests in a systematic manner.

 DOCUMENTATION AND WRITING: 10%
 Code must be well documented. May be asked to write short reports on the
status, design, implementation, and testing of code.
 Related Performance Standard: Programming habits that include documentation
during the development process. Basic familiarity with word processing
software and willingness to learn new word processor. Ability to write clear,
concise documentation.

About LRDC:

Since its founding in 1963, the Learning Research and Development Center
(LRDC) at the University of Pittsburgh has emerged as the leading research
institution for cognitive science and technology applied to education.  LRDC
faculty serve on numerous national advisory bodies, edit a number of scholarly
journals, and have served as officers of the leading scholarly associations in
their fields.  LRDC researchers helped introduce such ideas as individualized
instruction; criterion-referenced testing; using technology to enhance,
individualize and manage learning; and the student as an active learner who
constructs his or her own knowledge much as a scientist constructs socially
shared knowledge.  Today, LRDC researchers are leaders in many areas of
research and development, including basic processes of learning, learning in
the workplace, subject matter learning in school, and the improvement of
schooling.  Approximately $11 million worth of sponsored research projects are
managed by LRDC.

The Center has its own building, a nine-story facility.  The building is fully
networked with local Ethernet interconnected to the University backbone, which
is connected to the Internet with T3 bandwidth.  LRDC houses more than a dozen
high-end workstations and more than 200 personal computer systems.  In
addition to the shared University-wide file service (AFS), LRDC maintains four
very large Novell file servers on its premises, along with about a dozen
high-speed network printers.  Within the Center's building, sound and video
studio facilities permit authoring and editing of multimedia presentations,
including mastering of CD-ROM disks.
