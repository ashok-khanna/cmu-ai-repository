The Cognition Laboratory at NASA Ames Research Center is seeking qualified 
programmers and  computer scientists to augment our human-system modeling 
effort. We have developed a software architecture, Apex, that combines advanced
AI techniques (esp. planning, plan execution) with models of human cognition, 
perception, and motor performance to model human performance in complex task 
environments, such as air traffic control, airline cockpits, and launch
control.

Candidates must have strong programming skills including experience with Lisp, 
a demonstrated ability to learn new task domains, and strong motivation and
initiative. 
The ideal candidate will have experience in one or more of the following
areas: artificial 
intelligence programming, human performance modeling, aviation/space
operations, 
software engineering, engineering simulation. Employment would be through
San Jose
State University Foundation. Salary is negotiable, and commensurate with
experience
and training.
