To whom it may concern,

Sorry to interrupt.  I'm Jerry Bires of TechSearch, a recruiting firm in
Sausalito, California.  I'm working for a client that needs Knowledge
Engineers for consulting engagements in Jacksonville, Florida.

A detailed job description of the opportunity with this pre-IPO client
follows.  If something strikes a responsive chord, please contact me and we
can go thru the job spec and I'll inform you about the client.

Best,
Jerry Bires

Amped up about AI?  If you can conclusively convince my hiring authority,
then you're a shoe-in as a Knowledge Engineer for a significant player in
this space.  The respected Gartner Group is on record saying my pre-IPO
startup's software and services are the market share leaders in their space.
Our executive management team has a solid track record of taking prior
companies through the initial public offering (IPO) of stock.   We're in our
3rd round of venture capital funding AND we're already profitable.  What
does this mean to you?  An exceptional likelihood of doing challenging work
and seeing your stock options turn into something of value. 

Rarely does a knowledge engineer work on something with such high visibility
and long-term impact. Our technology is folded into Microsoft's suite of
products, including Office and NT Server.  We've been approached by several
giant, publicly traded companies in the IT space about a buyout.  

Our professional services consulting group needs a knowledge engineer
experienced writing code with Lisp (or another expert system languages) and
Java.  You'll develop software for use by global 500 clients for various
internet-related business problems.  You'll draw upon your experience
designing web, client/server, and network architectures to act as technical
and team lead.  You'll construct large, scalable solutions addressing
various interesting problems for Fortune 500 companies.  Your software will
be used by millions of professionals at the largest companies in the world!
The tasks included writing code and mentoring others in writing code in Java
and Lisp, and coaching client IT staff and executives in the process of
developing an expert system. 

Your peers at our company have a strong academic background in artificial
intelligence (AI) and are, frankly, biased for candidates with degrees from
good schools.  As a professional services consultant, you're in a culture
oriented toward getting things done and keeping the client happy.  Aside
from that, management is very laissez-faire and lets consultants construct a
lifestyle that works for them.  You'll find yourself in a peer group of
consulting knowledge engineers who mix well, share information and get along
very well.

Minimum requirements for this position include at least 5 years of software
development experience, two years experience programming with Lisp and/or
Java and completion of a bachelor's degree.  You must be authorized to work
in the U.S.  Optional experience:  Graduate degree in Computer Science,
experience working for a global IT consulting firm.  We desire any AI or
object-oriented language development experience such as LISP/CLOS, CLIPS,
KEE, C++, AionDS, Neuron Data shell, Art*Enterprise, ART-IM; CORBA or
architecture design experience.

The type of software you'll design successfully performs functions that no
other software has ever been able to accomplish.

Your resume will be enhanced by having played a key role in creating this
type of software because the market for this company's services is growing
exponentially.  

We can work with new graduates who have limited experience.  However, you
must have strong academically proven Lisp skills and a fire in your belly
for AI.

We're willing to relocate candidates to Jacksonville.  However we cannot
sponsor visas.

We have engagements now in Jacksonville that will keep you busy for months.
There could be travel to other cities in Florida or to other cities in your
region, such as Raleigh or Atlanta.  Travel will never be more than 50% and
you will always be home on weekends.
