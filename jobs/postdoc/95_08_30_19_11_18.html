			Postdoctoral Position
			 Columbia University
	 Natural Language Processing / Statistical Techniques


We are seeking a PhD with expertise in natural language
processing and statistical analysis for a post-doctoral position at
Columbia University. The project involves the  application of both
statistical techniques and language generation to the problem of text
summarization. We are investigating the use of statistical analysis
along with lexical relations to represent information in text for
input to a language generation system in order to produce a
summary. 

Qualifications: Applicants should have completed a PhD in the natural
language processing sub-field of computer science, be familiar with
statistical techniques for language processing, with lexical
semantics, and with language generation. Programming knowledge and interest
in system building necessary.  Interested applicants should
send CV to Prof. Kathleen McKeown via email at: kathy@cs.columbia.edu
and to Dr. Judith Klavans at klavans@cs.columbia.edu
