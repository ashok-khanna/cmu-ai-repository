Information about the GRASP Lab
-------------------------------
The GRASP Laboratory, on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, 
provides a unique environment for research in computer vision, 
robotics, and manufacturing technologies.  Faculty from 6 different 
departments, post-doctoral fellows, visiting researchers, and students 
work together on joint research projects.  Computing facilities include 
approximately twenty Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, IBM and HP 
workstations and color X-windows terminals.  The lab also possesses 
several robot manipulators and mobile platforms: two PUMA 560 
manipulators, two PUMA 250 manipulators, one Puma 260 manipulator, 
four TRC Labmate mobile platforms, one Lord gripper with force and 
tactile sensors, three Zebra 6-dimensional force/torque sensors, one 
Zebra Zero six degree of freedom manipulator, an instrumented compliant 
robot wrist, a number of tactile sensing arrays, and one Whole Arm 
Manipulator from Barret Design Inc.  The lab's sensors and special 
purpose processors include: two SONY color cameras, 16 high resolution 
b/w Sony cameras, two robot mounted SONY stereo cameras, one fixed and 
one mobile laser range finder, four 8 bit video digitizers, a TIM-40 
24-bit RGB framegrabber and two video/image processing modules with 
TMS320C40 processors, a TRC BiSight 2-axis stereo vergence camera 
platform, a Perceptron Range Imaging System and a Cyberware 3030R 3D 
Scanner.
