AI/SE Computer Scientist for NASA Ames Automatic Programming Project


JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

NASA Ames Research Center, located in Silicon Valley, is seeking a
computer scientist with a PhD or advanced research experience in
automated reasoning and/or formal methods.  The job is to participate in
project-oriented research, technology development, and application
development in the following areas of advanced software engineering:

  * next-generation automatic programming systems

  * software verification and validation using formal methods.

This position is full-time and long-term with significant growth
potential. The initial responsibilities and salary are well suited to
candidates with a PhD obtained recently, or within the last ten
years. The ideal candidate will have skills both in basic research and
application development, and be able to fluidly use both in leading-edge
projects. Interpersonal and communication skills, both verbal and
written, are also important.

The project is oriented toward strategic research; that is, focused
research whose target application is in the 5 to 15 year time horizon.
Strategic research differs from pure basic research in being focused,
project-oriented, and team-oriented.  Strategic research differs from
applied research by its extended time horizon: the objective is to
develop fundamentally new technology, rather than just apply existing
technology.

This position is currently available.  US citizenship or green card
status is preferred. The bulk of the work will be performed on site at
NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley between San Jose and San
Francisco.  The job also entails travel to other NASA centers.  


BACKGROUND
----------

The goal of the Amphion project is to make knowledge-based software
engineering (KBSE) a reality for NASA.  KBSE uses techniques from
artificial intelligence and formal methods to raise the level at which
users program to the specification level (what is the problem to be
solved) rather than the detailed code level (how to solve a problem).
Programs are generated automatically from specifications. The Amphion
project is a pioneer in the real-world use of deductive synthesis for
program synthesis. In deductive synthesis, a program and its proof of
correctness are generated concurrently through automatic theorem
proving.

The Amphion project has developed a number of application-oriented
automatic programming systems. The project is now aiming toward the
development of the Meta-Amphion system - a suite of generic tools for
developing automatic programming systems.  Initial research toward this
goal won the best paper award at the KBSE'95 conference.

The project is also be developing technology for validation and verification
of intelligent autonomous systems, such as the next generation deep-space
satellites being developed by NASA.

TO APPLY
--------

Please send email to Dr. Michael Lowry (lowry@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov)
and cc Thomas Pressburger (ttp@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov).
   
containing the following: 

  * a cover-letter (ASCII);
  * a resume or curriculum vitae (ASCII or Postscript);
  * one or two recent papers. (Postscript format preferred. Microsoft RTF,
	Framemaker MIF, or LaTex format acceptable only if files are completely
	standard and cross-platform compatible. A URL to a paper on a reliable
	WEB site is also acceptable.)

        
Make sure your submission includes

  * names and contact information for references;

  * a description of your research project experience
    and/or application development experience related to
    automated reasoning and formal methods.

If you are unable to send email, a hardcopy of this information can be
mailed to:

   Dr. Michael Lowry
   MS 269-2
   NASA Ames Research Center
   Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000
   USA

Preliminary interviews will be held either by telephone or in the
Silicon Valley area.
