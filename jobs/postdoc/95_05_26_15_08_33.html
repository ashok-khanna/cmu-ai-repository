              Postdoc/Research Associate in automated signal recognition

We are launching a major new effort to develop techniques for automated 
identification/recognition of animal vocalizations under real-world conditions.
Two laboratories will be involved, one which will have primary  responsibility
for collecting and annotating field recordings of animal  vocalizations, 
whereas my lab will have primary responsibilities for developing the analysis 
procedures.  The primary responsibilities of the research associate will 
include algorithm development and evaluation, reporting results, as well as 
immediate oversight of the project.  The individual should have familiarity 
with a variety of recognition approaches for acoustic signals, for example 
dynamic time-warping, hidden Markov models, and artificial neural 
networks (TDNN and recurrent backprop).  Background in speech recognition is 
probably helpful but is not essential.  Oversight responsibilities will include
1) interacting with a programmer (see related advertisement), 2) interacting 
with another postdoc/ research associate who will interface with the other 
laboratory, and 3) helping to manage the local computer resources.  These will
comprise a compute server (of the class of SGI Power Challenge or DEC Alpha), 
workstations, a large disk farm, and a large (TB) near-line storage facility.

The salary range is $20,000 to $40,000, depending on experience.  The project 
will be conducted under contract with an anticipated start-date of July, 1995.
Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.   Via e-mail, fax,
or surface mail, send CV, a statement of interest, background, and 
qualifications, and names and contact for references.  The University of 
Chicago is an Affirmative-Action/Equal-Opportunity employer.
