Description: Two-year position working on natural language processing
within the Soar project.  Our main focus will be to extend the current
models of comprehension and generation (NL-Soar) within the context of
military simulations.  In particular, the current system is oriented
toward real-time dialog behavior between intelligent agents (e.g.
pilot, wing, air controller) participating in simulated engagements in
the tactical air domain. Although this work will continue under the
current position, we will also be responsible for providing a
real-time, incremental language capability between these agents and
command level agents also built within the Soar framework.

The natural language project consists of 1 faculty member, 3 graduate
students and a post-doc. In addition to the applications mentioned above,
current research using NL-Soar includes issues in language acquisition,
speech recognition, and simultaneous translation. The language project
exists within a larger Soar community (about 15 members at CMU, about 100
active researchers throughout the world). A person filling this position is
expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation
of the system, as well as contribute to the intellectual life of the community.

Qualifications: Applicants should have a B.S.,  M.S. or  Ph.D. in computer
science or computational linguistics. THIS IS A SYSTEM-BUILDING POSTDOC, so a
very strong background in building systems is required.  Experience in both
language generation and comprehension is preferred. Basic knowledge of
machine learning techniques helpful. APPLICANT MUST BE ABLE TO START WORK
BY SEPTEMBER 1.

To apply: send a resume and names of three references to physical or
e-mail address above. Please have recommendations letters specifically
address the system building strengths and weaknesses of the applicant.
