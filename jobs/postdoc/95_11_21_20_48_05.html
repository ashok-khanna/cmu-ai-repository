A post doctoral research fellow is required is to work on an
interdisciplinary project with the School of Computing and
Mathematical Sciences and the School of Biological and Chemical
Sciences.  The ideal candidate would be a good software engineer
preferably with experience in hybrid knowledge representation
for molecular biological applications, some skills in knowledge
elicitation and mathematical modelling - possibly for intelligent
real time instrumentation and control.  This is a system-building
position within the context of a specific application, so a strong
systems design and implementation background is required.

The individual will form part of a multidisciplinary research team.
The work is supported for 2.5 years by a grant from the EPSRC.
