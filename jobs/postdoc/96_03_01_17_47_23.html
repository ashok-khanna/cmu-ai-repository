			 Post-Doctoral Fellow

The Qualitative Reasoning Group at the University of Texas at Austin,
led by Professor Benjamin Kuipers, is looking for a post-doctoral
fellow to work on the Algernon KR system.

The Algernon knowledge representation system provides a unique set of
formal and practical features that have already proven effective for
building moderate-scale applications, and potentially can scale up to
very large knowledge bases.
	http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/qr/algernon.html

We are undertaking a project to extend the features of the language
and its implementation, evaluating it for its ability to meet the
needs of a separate, high-quality, research group building a very
large knowledge base in Biology.
	http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/

This is an opportunity for a suitably qualified and ambitious
scientist to take a leadership role in an important project, and to
have a significant impact on knowledge representation theory and
practice.

Tasks:

 - Extend the Algernon KR system with contexts, opaque references, and
other state-of-the-art mechanisms.

 - Extend and maintain the formal guarantees provided by Algernon
while adding features needed by pragmatic users.

 - Collaborate with the Biology KB group to support their use of
Algernon as the KR engine for their multi-function knowledge base.

 - Evaluate Algernon with respect to the BKB group's needs for
expressive power, inferential power, computational efficiency, and
scalability.

Qualifications:

 - PhD in Computer Science or related discipline.

 - Research accomplishment in the formalization and application of
knowledge representation systems.

 - Demonstrated skill and experience in implementation of KR systems.

 - Ability to work with pragmatically motivated user groups

Period:

 - Start immediately.
 - Funding guaranteed through 12-31-97.  Soft thereafter.

Salary:  competitive.

Send CV, Web URL, representative papers, and three letters of reference, to:
