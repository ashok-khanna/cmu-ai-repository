Subject: Research fellowship at Birmingham on Autonomous Intelligent Agents
Organization: Nova Southeastern University

                      THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM
                       SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
             Research Fellow: Autonomous Intelligent Agents

Applications are invited from established researchers with a PhD in AI
or Cognitive Science, and solid experience of Artificial Intelligence
programming (preferably Pop-11), for a three year research fellowship
(to start as soon as possible) working with Professor Aaron Sloman on a
project involving the design of autonomous intelligent agents, in
collaboration with DRA Malvern.

Work at Birmingham within the Cognition and Affect group is concerned
with generic architectures for sophisticated human-like intelligent
agents, including, for example, work on modelling human motivation,
emotional processes, high level control of attention, etc.

The work at DRA will apply our tools and techniques to develop
simulations of interacting agents for training commanders. This project
is concerned with exploring long term issues rather than producing a
product in three years, though there should be demonstrable prototypes.

The post is on the Research Grade 1A scale, with starting salary
in the range 13,941 -- 19,326 (Plus superannuation).

Please submit applications as soon as possible. Interviews will be held
soon after the closing date. The post will begin as soon as possible.
