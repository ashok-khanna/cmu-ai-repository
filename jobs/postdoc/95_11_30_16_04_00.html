Subject: Postdoctoral Fellowships at IRCS (UPenn)

The Institute for Research in Cognitive Science (IRCS) at the University of
Pennsylvania provides opportunities for several postdoctoral positions in
Cognitive Science. 

The Institute brings together researchers in the common pursuit of an
understanding of the human mind, and fosters the development of new technology
arising from this understanding.  Over 40 Penn faculty members across 5
departments are currently associated with IRCS, linking together the
disciplines of computer and information science, linguistics, mathematical
logic, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology.

Listed below are researchers whose area of investigation may be relevant to
this newsgroup:
