the mission to develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and provide quantitative
performance analysis of methods, algorithms, and underlying theories necessary
to design and build reliable sensor-based robots capable of executing sets of
tasks in unstructured workspaces.  Our current focus is in the areas of
cooperative robotic systems and complex non-linear control.

Interested applicants should send a letter (via email (preferred), fax, or
ground mail) with your vita to:
