		Post-Doctoral Research Positions in
	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / MACHINE LEARNING AND MUSIC
			     at the
	AUSTRIAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 [ Please distribute this call to anyone you think might be interested ]



We are pleased to announce the availability of several post-doctoral
research positions at the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial
Intelligence in Vienna, Austria.
We are looking for scientists to work in a research project on

  Artificial Intelligence Models of Expressive Music Performance.

The project is funded by a generous research prize/grant awarded to
Dr. Gerhard Widmer, of the Austrian Research Institute for AI,
by the Austrian Federal Government (a brief description of the current
state of this research and the results so far can be found at
http://www.ai.univie.ac.at/oefai/ml/music/musicproject.html).

The goal of the project is to apply Machine Learning methods to the
discovery and analysis of principles of expressive music performance;
that includes basic research on appropriate music representations,
the analysis and modelling, in AI terms, of musicological theories
of structural music perception and their relevance to musical
expression,
the development of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
for the analysis of complexly structured performance data, the analysis
of the learning results in the light of knowledge from musicology and
cognitive science, and many other interesting research tasks.

For this strongly interdisciplinary project, we are looking for a
(possibly heterogeneous) group of two or three post-doctoral researchers
with a strong background (and a completed Ph.D.) in

  - either machine learning / pattern recognition / general AI
  - or music theory / cognitive musicology or some related field.

Preference will be given to candidates who combine expertise
in both music and computing/AI and who already have a record
of interdisciplinary research involving one or more of the above fields.
Equally important (though not easily measurable) are creativity
and the ability and motivation to contribute innovative ideas to an
exciting research project; the PostDocs will be given a lot of freedom
in formulating research goals and pursuing their research and thus
shaping the project.

The salary will be in the area of ATS 380.000,- ( ~ ECU 27.500,-)
per year (before taxes).
The positions are initially open for two years, but can be extended
for up to four additional years.
The projected starting date is October 1998, but later dates are
possible.

If possible, applications should be sent by e-mail. 
Please send your application (with CV, publications list, one or two
substantial and pertinent publications, the names of two persons willing
to write a letter of recommendation if needed, and any other material
you consider interesting (e.g., photographs, link to home page, etc.)
