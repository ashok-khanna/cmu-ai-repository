      Lectureships in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

			       March 1995

Applications are invited for two Lectureships in the Computer Science
and Artificial Intelligence Group: one permanent and one two-year
fixed-term post. The persons appointed will be members of of the School
of Cognitive and Computing Sciences ("COGS").  The Group is highly rated
(awarded the highest rank in each of the last two research-assessment
exercises).

The permanent vacancy is for a theoretical computer scientist, to
replace Dr Edmund Robinson (now professor-elect of the University of
London). Theoretical computer science is one of the group's chief areas
of research strength with particular interests in the semantics of
programming languages and theories of concurrency.

The fixed-term post replaces a member of staff on secondment.
Appropriate subject specialisms include software engineering, software
design, human-computer interaction and CSCW.  Involvement with our
innovative MSc in Human-Centred Computer Systems is likely.

Salaries will be on the  1A or 1B scale.

Office, Sussex House, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH.
