Subject: Admin: Results of mail/news survey.
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

I received 68 messages requesting that we retain the mailing lists and
not switch to a newsgroup. Also, nobody volunteered to administer the
newsgroup creation process. So we will be sticking with mailing lists.

I've appended a summary of the comments I received to this message.
In addition, I received mail from several people who found their
current job through the list, and from several employers who found an
employee through the list.

Several people also commented that they liked my Prime Time Freeware
for AI book/CD-ROM.

One person asked me to archive the messages somewhere in the AI
Repository's Web pages. This is already being done; I just
forgot to announce it to the list. All postings sent to the list are
automatically archived in appropriate subdirectories of
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/
The equivalent web page is
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/other/jobs.html
Right now posts are given a filename based on the date and time received.

My decision is to remain with the status quo. If I ever decide to
create a newsgroup, it will be in addition to the mailing lists, and
will be moderated. There wouldn't be much additional effort on my part
(aside from the newsgroup creation bureaucracy), because posts to a
moderated newsgroup get sent to the moderator. 

Incidentally, I get some of the job announcements from newsgroups. I
wrote a PERL program that scans several newsgroups every night for
AI-related job postings, and saves them to a directory. About half of
them are junk, headhunters, or repeats, so I delete them, and the
remainder get posted about once a week. The rest of the announcements
are direct from the employers. It takes me only about 5 to 10 minutes a
week to manage the lists because of this automation, and most of that
time is spent dealing with bounces. 

Unfortunately, the scanner isn't sophisticated enough to detect
certain kinds of AI-related job announcements. For example, it cannot
retrieve AI Planning jobs, because the word "planning" is in about 75%
of all job postings (i.e., jobs that require employees with good
planning skills).

Here is a paraphrase of some of the comments I received:

   +  Can't read netnews. 

   +  Many employers do not permit employees to read newsgroups, but
      they do allow email.

   +  Employers who do permit netnews, do not always carry a full
      feed. Employees might feel very awkward asking them to carry the
      new newsgroup.

   +  Doesn't have the time to read news regularly.

   +  Mail messages are easier to redistribute.

   +  More likely to read messages via email.

   +  Mailing list has a high signal to noise ratio because it is
      effectively moderated.

   +  Mail is received quicker and in a more timely fashion than news.
      News posts are often delayed by days.

   +  News feed is unreliable, especially overseas.

   +  When actively searching for a job, mail is better.

   +  News expires and mail doesn't.

   +  Mail can be batch downloaded and read offline, keeping costs down.

   +  Can't use mail filtering tools with a newsgroup.

   +  The minimal effort in subscribing to a mailing list keeps riffraff out.

   +  Employer: Gets better and higher quality response from mailing list.

   +  Too much volume in news.

   +  If we switch to a newsgroup, it must be moderated. An unmoderated
      newsgroup would have more junk and noise than real announcements. 

   +  The volume of posts might not support three newsgroups, so may
      have just comp.ai.jobs.

   +  Call the newsgroup comp.ai.announce.jobs to prevent it from
      being used as a gripe forum.

   +  Permitting resumes is a bad idea -- it would increase the noise.
