The C. S. Draper Laboratory invites applicants for a two-year
PostDoc fellowship (The Solomon J. Buchsbaum Postdoctoral
Fellowship).  The areas of interest include guidance, navigation,
control, autonomous vehicles/systems, computer science, software
engineering, among others.  The fellowship is expected to be
highly competitive.

Recent (i.e., <= 3 years) recipients of PhDs, with US Citizenship,
are eligible.  Application deadline is 1 July 1995.

I, in particular, am seeking applicants with research
interests in digital image processing and computer vision.
We have an Image Recognition Systems group which conducts
research in variational and stochastic processing, multiscale
modeling, fractal and wavelet theory, and neural networks. Our
application areas include SAR processing, realtime autonomous
vision systems, sensor data fusion,  biomedical image processing,
NASA autonomous landing systems, underwater mine detection,
and others.  An applicant with complementary research interests
(e.g., model based vision) is highly desirable.

For background, Draper Laboratory is a Massachusetts chartered
not-for-profit R&D laboratory, and a leader in the development
of highly automated systems.  Draper is located next to the
MIT campus in Cambridge, MA, and maintains considerable educational
ties with the local universities, especially MIT, Harvard, BU,
Northeastern, and Tufts.

If you are interested in applying to the image processing / computer
vision areas, please send me your vitals:
