Industry Hosted Marie Curie Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Data and
Knowledge Management

Advertisement

Unilever Research delivers advanced innovation through science and technology
in order to support and drive forward Unilever's businesses. We have four
vacancies for postdoctoral fellows to carry out research in one of the
following areas: text analysis, agent based systems, data mining, data
visualisation and knowledge management in order to extend our understanding of
consumers and contribute to product design . The fellowships last two years and
will be based at our Port Sunlight Laboratory in North-West England. 

To apply you will possess a PhD in computational linguistics, computer science,
mathematics, statistics, AI, electronic engineering or a related discipline. In
addition you will have good computer programming skills, good communication
skills and ideally expertise in one of the following areas: computer graphics,
internet technology, collaboration via computer networks, knowledge management,
natural language engineering, complex adaptive systems, agent based systems,
decision trees, signal processing, surface modelling or operational research.
As a research fellow you will benefit from exposure to a modern,
forward-looking industrial research environment and receive structured training
under our Scientist Development Scheme. Help with relocation can be provided
where necessary. 

To apply for any of these positions send a full CV indicated your preferred
area of research and including two referees to Mark Butler, Unilever Research
Port Sunlight Laboratory, Bebington, Wirral, CH63 3JW, UK; or email
Mark.Butler@unilever.com including 'EU postdoc' in the subject line. We are
intending to fill at least one of these positions by the start of September
2000, therefore the application deadline is the 22 of May 2000. 

Description of training areas

Several research training areas have been selected within the Data and
Knowledge Management Host Group. We expect to place four postdoctoral
researchers dependent on their interests and experience: 

Text analysis involves the development of empirical methods that employ
learning techniques to automatically extract knowledge from natural language.
Potential application areas include consumer interview analysis and science
area mapping. 

Agent based systems consist of multiple components that are autonomous,
heterogeneous and intelligent. Two possible application areas are modelling
consumer behaviour and developing negotiation techniques for automated trading
platforms. 

Data mining is the process of discovering meaningful correlations from large
amounts of data using pattern recognition, statistical and mathematical
techniques. A potential application area is applying decision trees to consumer
data. 

Knowledge management is making the optimal use of knowledge within an
organisation. Possible research areas include investigating knowledge workshops
to determine optimal facilitation strategies. 

Virtual environments combine technologies from data visualisation, human
computer interaction and haptic simulation. Possible applications include
exploring consumer perception of the feel of surfaces, using controlled
environments to investigate consumer behaviour and using distributed virtual
environments to enable collaboration or support learning. 


Benefits to fellows

By the end of their two year stay, the fellows will have been exposed to a
modern, dynamic industrial research environment. As well as receiving
comprehensive training, they will gain valuable technical skills and an
understanding of business requirements. These professional skills will be
transferable not only to Europe. At a scientific level they will gain
experience at the cutting edge of Adaptive computation, Visualisation,
Statistic and Knowledge Management. At Port Sunlight, we view the Industry Host
Scheme as an excellent opportunity to broaden our research programmes and
skills base in these areas. We will also benefit by establishing and
strengthening Europe-wide links with leading research groups who will be the
principal sources of fellows. Finally, the scheme offers us new recruitment
opportunities, as Port Sunlight continues to expand. 

It is anticipated that the fellows will receive a subsistence allowance of
approximately 2050 euros per month along with a mobility allowance of
approximately 400 euros per month. 

Eligibility of fellows

The fellows must meet the following criteria:

1.	Nationality or residence
Fellows must be EU nationals of a Member of Associated State or be able to
provide proof of having resided in Member States for at least the last five
years prior to their selection by the host company (e.g. national residing
permits, employment contracts, university registration etc). Fellows should
ensure that they are bale to fulfil the immigration and visa requirements for
the Member or Associated State in which the host company is located. 

2.	Professional Situation
At the time of selection, fellows may not be employed by the company or an
affiliated organisation, any may not have been employed in research in any
industrial or commercial company for more than one year following completion of
their university studies (graduate level).

3.	Mobility
Fellows may not carry out their research training in the country of their
nationality. Companies may not appoint researchers who have carried out their
normal activity (work, studies etc.) in the country where the research is going
to take place for more than 12 months in the two years immediately prior to
their selection by the host company. Nationals of an Associated State may not
do research in an Associated State.
