Post-Doc Wanted!


The Andes project at the Learning Research and Development Center, 
University of Pittsburgh, seeks a computer science post-doctoral 
research associate.  The Andes project is developing a tutoring system 
that will teach college physics.  The system will be used both as a 
testbed for evaluating various instructional methods and as a means of 
improving instruction in a 1200-student university physics class.  The 
research associate will be part of an 11-person team composed of 
physicists, computer scientists and cognitive scientists.  The specific 
responsibilities of the research associate will be to develop a student 
modeling system.  The system will induce and maintain a model of the 
students' knowledge of physics given continuous data on the student's 
performance.  The system should employ techniques from recent research 
in AI methods for reasoning with uncertainty, such as Bayesian belief 
networks.  

The research associate should have a PhD in AI, preferably with a 
specialization in reasoning from uncertainty and some familiarity with 
machine learning.  Knowledge of C and Lisp are pluses, although not 
necessary.  The position is funded from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 
1997.  The compensation includes a competitive salary and full benefits.
