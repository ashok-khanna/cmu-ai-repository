DESCRIPTION:
Post doctoral candidate needed for a project involving research and
development in Intelligent Agents for information access, decision support
and interoperability. The project will involve research into general 
coordination of 
Agents for information gathering. The work involves topics in planning and 
learning 
with emphasis on  distributed intelligent agent architectures, coordination 
protocols 
and distributed control.The task is challenging in that it involves developing 
state of the art Intelligent Distributed Systems / Intelligent Agents in a 
real world environment while researching topics in machine learning, 
case-based reasoning and distributed systems.
 
The work environment is supportive and informal. The task involves
interacting with faculty, graduate students and research programmers
in a high motivation and high technical competency environment.
A good opportunity for publishing of papers based on original research. 
Compensation will be based on experience and qualifications. The
