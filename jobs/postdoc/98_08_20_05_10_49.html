Postdoctoral Researchers in Music Cognition

At the Nijmegen Institute of Cognition and Information (NICI) of the
Nijmegen University a research team was set up in September 1997, supported
by the Dutch Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO) as the PIONIER
project "Music, Mind, Machine". This project aims at improving the
understanding of the temporal aspects of musical knowledge and music
cognition using computational models. The research is interdisciplinary in
nature, with contributions from music theory, psychology and computer
science.
	A number of studies is planned, grouped according to the following
perspectives: the computational modeling methodology, the music domain
itself, and applications of the findings. The methodological studies are
concerned with the development of cognitive modeling languages, the study
of (sub)symbolic formalisms, the development of programming language
constructs for music, and the evaluation of physical metaphors in modeling
expressive timing. The domain studies focus on specific temporal aspects of
music, such as beat induction, grace note timing, musical expression and
continuous modulations in music performance. In these areas both the
construction of computational models and their experimental validation are
being undertaken. The theoretical results will be applied in e.g., editors
for musical expression for use in recording studios.
	In order to realize these aims, a multi-disciplinary research group
was formed, in which teamwork and collaboration play a crucial role. It is
expected that all team members are actively involved in building the team
and the realization of the project's aims. The demands on the team members
is high, conducting innovative and internationally recognized research.
However, in return, our stimulating research environment provides adequate
training and technical support, including a high-quality infrastructure and
recording and music processing facilities. Close contact is maintained with
the international community of researchers in this field.

More information on the project and a description of the planned studies
can be found at http://www.nici.kun.nl/mmm

 Ref 21.2.98
One postdoc will be responsible for improving an existing connectionist
model for quantization and will design and validate this and other models
and supervise their implementation. Quantization is the process of
separating the categorical, discrete timing components -durations as
notated in the musical score- from the continuous deviations in a musical
performance. The project has, next to the fundamental aspects
(connectionist models of categorical rhythm perception and their empirical
validation), an important practical focus and aims at developing a robust
component for automatic music transcription systems. The research will be
realized at the lab for Medical and Biophysics (MBFYS) and at the Nijmegen
Institute for Cognition and Information (NICI), both at the University of
Nijmegen and is funded by the Dutch Foundation for Technical Sciences
(STW). We are looking for a psychologist with experience in both
experimental methods and in computational modeling. Experience with
attractor networks is an advantage. Appointment will be full-time for three
years, with a possible extension.

Ref 21.3.98
The other position requires a Doctorate in Music Theory/Analysis,
Psychology, or Music Cognition. A thorough knowledge of the music cognition
literature is required, preferably centering on a computational modeling
approach. In addition, the candidate needs to have ample practical
experience in conducting experiments and a thorough knowldege of music
theory. Although the project focuses on musical performance and rhythmic
structure, research experience in these domains is not essential. He or she
must be able and willing to collaborate with the other members of the team
on existing research projects and contribute to the supervision of doctoral
level research. The ability to communicate clearly and work as part of a
team is crucial. Experience in collaboration with researchers from computer
science, artificial intelligence, or music technology would be beneficial,
as would some knowledge of these fields.
Appointment will be full-time for two years, with a possible extension.

The Faculty of Social Sciences intents to employ a proportionate number of
women and men in all positions in the faculty. Women are therefore urgently
invited to apply. The selection procedure may entail an assessment of
collaboration and communication skills. Applications (three copies, in
English or Dutch) including a curriculum vitae and a statement about the
candidate's professional interests and goals, and one copy of recent work
(e.g., thesis, computer program, article) should be mailed before the 1st
of November to the  Department of Personnel & Organization, Faculty of
Social Sciences, Catholic University Nijmegen, P.O.Box 9104, 6500 HE
Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Please mark envelope and letter with the
appropriate vacancy number. Questions can be addressed to Renee Timmers:
