Subject: Postdoc: Tutoring system at U.. of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA)

The  Andes project at the   Learning Research and Development  Center,
University  of Pittsburgh, seeks    a computer science   post-doctoral
Research   Associate with a background   in  tutoring systems or  user
modeling.  The Research Associate will coordinate the Andes project as
well as develop one module of the Andes tutoring system.

The goal of the Andes project is to develop and test a tutoring system
that teaches college  physics.   The system will  be  used both   as a
testbed for evaluating various instructional methods and as a means of
improving instruction in a 1200-student university physics class.  The
Research  Associate  will be part  of   an 11-person  team composed of
physicists, computer scientists and cognitive scientists.

The Research Associate will have two main responsibilities.  One is to
develop  a help  system that coaches    the student on procedural  and
strategic   issues involved in physics    problem solving.  This  help
system is one of  6 main modules  in the Andes  tutoring  system.  The
second responsibility of the Research Associate  will be to coordinate
the software development and testing of the  whole Andes team.  In the
later stages of the project, the  Andes team will conduct formal field
experiments with  students  using  various   versions of  Andes.   The
Research Associate will be responsible  for coordinating the fieldwork
as well, and meshing it with the software development.

The Research  Associate should have  a PhD in Artificial Intelligence,
preferably with  a specialization  in intelligent tutoring  systems or
user   modeling.   Knowledge of   Lisp  and  experience  in team-based
software development  are necessary.   The  position  is funded for  3
years,  starting January  1,    1996.  The  compensation  includes   a
competitive salary and full benefits.  If interest, please immediately
contact Kurt VanLehn (the PI) via the following:
