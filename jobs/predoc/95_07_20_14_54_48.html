                EMERGENT AND EVOLUTIONARY   BEHAVIOUR,
                    INTELLIGENCE,  AND  COMPUTATION
                                (EEBIC)

Applications are invited  for  a number of Studentships  for full-time
PhD research in  the School of Computer  Science to carry out research
within the recently founded EEBIC group.

The group's research interests include: evolutionary computation (e.g.
genetic  algorithms  and   genetic programming),  emergent  behaviour,
emergent   intelligence  (e.g.   emergent  communication),    emergent
computation and artificial  life and  their practical applications  in
hard engineering problems.

The members  of the group,  at  Birmingham and  elsewhere, are  active
researchers in Artificial Intelligence, Engineering or Psychology with
a  variety  of   different backgrounds  including   Biology,  Computer
Science, Engineering, Psychology and Philosophy. In addition to EEBIC,
the research experience of the members  of the group includes computer
vision, neural nets, signal processing, intelligent autonomous agents,
hybrid  inference systems,  computer emotions, logic  and many others.
The  group interacts very closely  with the Cognition and Affect group
led  by  Aaron Sloman  who is  a   member of both   groups.  (For more
information  see   URLs: ftp://ftp.cs.bham.ac.uk/pub/groups/cog_affect
and http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs .)

The successful  applicants will  join the  group's effort  to  explore
EEBIC in many interesting directions (from engineering to  psychology,
from new practical applications  to new theoretical frameworks).  They
will have  constant  interaction  and  collaboration  with  the  other
members of  the  group.

In addition to  the usual  requirements of possessing  a good  honours
degree (equivalent to  a first or  upper second class  degree in a  UK
university) and  being EU  residents, the  successful candidates  will
need to be particularly open minded to the cross-fertilisation in  the
group deriving from  the different backgrounds  and experience of  the
members.

Additional information  about how  to  apply and about  the  School is
available via WWW from URL: http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk
