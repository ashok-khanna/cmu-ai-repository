Studentship Announcement

Position:

We have a position available for a new Ph.D. student, funded by a three
year grant.  The position is not restricted by citizenship.  It is
starting 1 October 1995.

Context:

The research work is to be done in the Partial Evaluation Group at
IRISA (Brittany, France).  This group mainly consists of 1 faculty
member, 2 research scientists, 4 Ph.D. students, and 1 research
assistant.  More information about the place and the research topics of
the group can be obtained from our Web page (URL:
http://www.irisa.fr/EXTERNE/projet/lande/consel/index.html)

Research Area:

Partial Evaluation is a program transformation approach.  It is aimed
at specializing programs with respect to invariants.  We are working on
partial evaluation of imperative and applicative languages.  We are
applying this approach to applications such as operating systems (in
collaboration with the Oregon Graduate Institute).

Ph.D. Topic:

The research project is aimed at developing partial evaluation
techniques for real time and distributed systems.  An example of this
is telecommunication applications.  As such, this topic combines both
systems and programming language aspects.  Applicants should have a
solid background in some of these areas.

Please contact Charles Consel (consel@irisa.fr) if you need further
information.  To apply send a resume, the name of three references, and
a statement of purpose.
