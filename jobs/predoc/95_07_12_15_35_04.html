POSITION OPEN FOR A DOCTORAL STUDENT IN THE
INTEGRATED ENGINEERING PROGRAM AT OHIO UNIVERSITY
_________________________________________________

Project: Study of Mobile Robots mounted with a six DOF manipulator.
         The project involves:
         * interfacing an off-the-shelf manipulator arm to a mobile robot
         * interfacing the electronics needed for control of the
           manipulator on the mobile base
         * programming the system using a real time operating system
           like Vx-Works
         * linking the mobile base and the manipulator to an off-board
           host computer, running a real time os,  using wireless ethernet.
         * interfacing of external sensors like vision systems to the
           mobile base
         * developing algorithms for autonomous navigation, manipulation
           and retrieval of objects.


Requirements: The candidate must have either a mechanical or electrical
engineering background. The candidate  must have had prior experience in
dealing with  interface and control of electrical and mechanical systems.
The project requires a fairly in-depth understanding of  both electronics
and mechanical systems design and is a challenging prospect for students
wishing to develop skills in both the fields. There are additional
requirements for admission into the program.
