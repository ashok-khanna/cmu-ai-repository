Nonmonotonic Reasoning (NMR) and Belief Revision (BR). At present there
are two main lines of work:

* The development of a toolkit for nonmonotonic reasoning which will offer
  implementations of a variety of methods for NMR and BR. Of particular
  interest are strategies for rendering these methods more practical. The
  focus is likely to be on issues such as structuring, combination with
  Object Oriented techniques, parallelization etc.

* We are looking at applications of these methods to practical problems.
  The area that has attracted most interest in this respect is Legal
  Reasoning, although other areas such as the analysis of negotiation
