The Computational Intelligence Research Laboratory (CIRL) would like
to encourage students interested in doctoral studies in formal aspects
of AI to consider graduate school at the University of Oregon in
Eugene.  Research at CIRL primarily centers on knowledge
representation and reasoning, with an emphasis on constraint
satisfaction and reasoning about action and physical devices.  Faculty
members include:

        James M. Crawford
        David W. Etherington
        Matthew L. Ginsberg
        Joseph C. Pemberton

We plan to hire one additional faculty member to join us in the fall.

CIRL has funds available to support up to four new Ph.D. students next
year.  The lab fosters an intimate relationship among a small group of
researchers working in closely-related areas and the graduate students
we supervise.  The existing CIRL faculty members currently supervise
five graduate students, two of whom will be graduating this year.

Eugene is a community of approximately 150,000 located just west of
the Cascades in Oregon.  An hour and a half from both skiing and the
ocean, it offers a wide range of outdoor activities and a reasonable
cost of living.

If you are interested in more details about CIRL, please feel free to
get in touch with any of us or to look at our WWW page at
http://cirl.uoregon.edu.  Applications should be made through the
University of Oregon Computer and Information Sciences department.
Details on the CIS program and application materials can be obtained
from betty@cs.uoregon.edu.

The deadline for applying to the Ph.D. program at the University of
Oregon is March 1, although extensions can be granted for
exceptionally qualified students.

Thanks!

                                                Matt Ginsberg
