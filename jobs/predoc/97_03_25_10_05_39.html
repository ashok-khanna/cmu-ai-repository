Two positions will shortly become available, in an industrial research
team working on a leading-edge system of concept processing, for two
graduates or near-graduates to work in Conceptual Lexicography. Their
backgrounds will include one or more of the following: Cognitive
Science, Lexicography, (Non Chomskyan) Linguistics, Cognitive Grammar,
Neurolinguistics, or Semantics. Skills in English, either as a first
language or as a completely bilingual ability, are essential. It would
be desirable for the candidate to have a knowledge of computational
linguistics and/or artificial intelligence, and to possess some skills
in computing (eg. Microsoft Access, Windows NT, C or C++).

The parts of the project in which each will be working involves the
application of a comprehensive system of conceptual codes to the
construction and use of conceptual dictionaries in the development of
one or more products. The individuals will be required to work closely
with three other lexicographers and to liaise with all other members of
the team.  Each candidate should be able to unambiguously establish
his/her  ability to conduct research, and to demonstrate a clear and
definite interest in this
R & D area. Salaries are competitive, and the company provides a full
set of benefits and an annual bonus plan.

If you are interested in these positions, please first fax or e-mail me
your CV, as soon as possible before April 8th, and provide a phone
number where we can reach you for a confidential conversation.
