The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (OGI) has
several openings for outstanding Ph.D. students in its Center for
Information Technologies.  The center includes faculty from the
department of Computer Science and Engineering and the department
of Electrical Engineering and Applied Physics.  Center members
perform research in a broad range of information processing areas
including nonlinear and adaptive signal processing, statistical
computation, decision analysis, speech, images, prediction, control,
economics, and finance.

We are specifically looking for potential Ph.D. students who hold
masters degrees in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering with
knowledge and/or interest adaptive signal processing, statistics,
speech and image processing, neural networks and machine learning.  We
seek qualified candidates to join research projects in Fall / Winter
of 1995.  Special funding opportunities are available for U.S.
citizens and U.S. nationals, although foreign nationals will also be
considered.  Research areas include neural networks, adaptive signal
processing, simulation of human auditory and visual perception,
speech and image processing, time-series prediction, learning theory,
algorithms, and architectures.  Specific projects include speech
enhancement in cellular communication, sunspot and solar flux
forecasting, speech and image representation, novel techniques for
regression, and economic and financial applications.

      Research Interests of Faculty and Postdocs in CIT


Hynek Hermansky (Associate Professor, EEAP and CSE);

Hynek Hermansky is interested in speech processing by humans  and
machines  with  engineering  applications  in  speech and speaker
recognition, speech coding, enhancement, and synthesis. His  main
research  interest  is  in  practical engineering models of human
information processing.


Todd K. Leen (Associate Professor, CSE and EEAP):

Todd Leen's research  spans  theory  of  neural  network  models,
architecture  and  algorithm  design  and  applications to speech
recognition. His theoretical work is  currently  focused  on  the
foundations  of  stochastic learning, while his work on Algorithm
design  is  focused  on  fast  algorithms  for  non-linear   data
modeling.

John Moody (Associate Professor, CSE and EEAP):

John Moody does research on the design and analysis  of  learning
algorithms, statistical learning theory (including generalization
and model selection), optimization  methods  (both  deterministic
and  stochastic),  and  applications  to  signal processing, time
series, economics and finance.


Misha Pavel (Associate Professor, CSE and EEAP):

Misha Pavel does mathematical and  neural  modeling  of  adaptive
behaviors   including  visual  processing,  pattern  recognition,
visually  guided  motor  control,  categorization,  and  decision
making.  He is also interested in the application of these models
to sensor fusion, visually guided vehicular control,  and  human-
computer interfaces.


Eric A. Wan  (Assistant Professor, EEAP and CSE):

Eric Wan's research activities include learning algorithms and
architectures for neural networks and adaptive signal processing.
He is particularly interested in neural applications to time series
prediction, speech enhancement, adaptive control, active noise
cancellation, and telecommunications.


Andy Fraser (Associate Professor, Portland State University)

Andrew Fraser's research interests include non-linear dynamics,
information theory, signal modelling, prediction and detection.  He is
particularly interested in the application of modelling and prediction
to signal encoding and detection problems.


Holly Jimison (Assistant Professor, Oregon Health Sciences University)

Dr. Jimison is the Director of the Informed Patient Decision Group at
the Biomedical Information Communication Center at OHSU.  She is
interested in multimedia systems for patient-physician communication
and in application of decision theory to shared medical decision
making.
Hong Pi (Senior Research Associate, CSE):

Hong Pi's research interests include neural network models, time series
analysis, and dynamical systems theory.   He currently works on the
applications of nonlinear modeling and analysis techniques to time
series prediction problems.


Thorsteinn S. Rognvaldsson  (Post-Doctoral Research Associate, CSE):

Thorsteinn Rognvaldsson studies both applications and theory of
neural networks and other non-linear methods for function fitting
and classification. He is currently working on methods for choosing
regularization parameters and also comparing the performance of
neural networks with the performance of other techniques for
time series prediction.
