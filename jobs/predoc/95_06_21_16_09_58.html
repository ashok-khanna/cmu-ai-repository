               Neural Computing Research Group
               -------------------------------

       Dept of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics

              Aston University, Birmingham, UK



                 PHD RESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS
                 -------------------------


    ***  Full details at http://neural-server.aston.ac.uk/  ***


The Neural Computing Research Group has attracted substantial levels of 
industrial and research council funding and will therefore be able to offer 
a number of full-time PhD studentships to commence in October 1995. 

Currently we are seeking candidates for four studentships. These will pay 
full fees at the home rates and hence are suitable for UK and European 
Union citizens only. The studentships also cover living expenses at the same 
rate as a research council studentship.


Feature Extraction Techniques for Nonstationary Financial Market Time Series 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project will examine conventional and neural network techniques for the 
extraction of features to elucidate hidden structure in generally multivariate 
financial time series.The problem domain is made more complicated by the 
inherent nonstationarity of the time series. Techniques based on dynamical 
systems theory and statistical pattern analysis will be developed and applied 
to real-world data. 

The ideal candidate should be mathematically and computationally competent 
and have a general interest in the field of financial mathematics, although 
no previous experience in this area is required. The project is in 
collaboration with a financial company, Union CAL Ltd, London.


Validation and Verification of Neural Network Systems 
-----------------------------------------------------

(Two Studentships)

One of the major factors limiting the widespread exploitation of neural 
networks has been the perceived difficulty of ensuring that a trained network 
will continue to perform satisfactorily when installed in an operational 
system. In the case of safety-critical systems it is clearly vital that a 
high degree of overall system integrity be achieved. However, almost all 
potential applications of neural networks entail some level of undesirable 
consequence if the network generates incorrect or inaccurate predictions. 
Currently there is no general framework for assessing the robustness of 
neural network solutions or of systems containing embedded neural networks. 

These two studentships will be closely associated with a substantial project 
funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to address
the basic issues involved in validation of systems containing neural networks.
The studentships are funded by two industrial companies: British Aerospace and 
Lloyds Register of Shipping, and will involve developing case studies to 
demonstrate the applicability of validation and verification techiques to 
real-world applications involving neural networks. 

Potential candidates should be mathematically and computationally competent 
with a background either in artificial neural networks or another relevant 
field. 


Neural networks applied to ignition timing and automatic calibration
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This project involves a collaborative research programme between the Neural 
Computing Research Group and SAGEM in the general area of applying neural 
networks to the ignition timing and calibration of gasoline internal 
combustion engines. 

The ideal student would be computationally literate (preferably in C/C++) 
on UNIX and PC systems and have good mathematical and/or engineering 
abilities. An awareness of the importance of applying advanced technology
and implementing ideas as engineering products is essential. In addition
the ideal candidate would have some knowledge and interest in 
internal combustion engines and also relevant sensor technology.

The minimum entry qualification is a First Class or Upper Second Class
Honours degree in a relevant discipline, or the equivalent overseas 
qualification. 

Overseas applicants whose first language is not English must provide evidence
of competence in English. Acceptable evidence includes possession of a UK or
North American degree, or a formal certificate such as the British Council's
ELTS (6.0 or better) or the USA TOEFL (550 or better).
