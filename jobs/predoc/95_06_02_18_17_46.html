                THE UNIVERSITY OF WEST FLORIDA
         Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of
                   Human & Machine Cognition

          Florida AI Graduate (MS) Student Fellowship

The Institute for the Interdisciplinary Study of Human & Machine
Cognition (IHMC) at the University of West Florida invites your
application for the Fall of 1995. This is a special research
fellowship restricted to Florida residents.

The IHMC was founded with legislative support in 1990 as an
interdisciplinary research unit. Additionally, IHMC has succeeded
in securing substantial extramural support and has established an
enviable research and publication record. Interdisciplinary research
is underway in the computational and philosophical foundations of AI,
computers in education, knowledge-based systems, neural networks,
internet-based autonomous agents, cognitive psychology, and reasoning
under uncertainty.

The University is situated in a 1000-acre protected nature preserve
bordering the Escambia River, and is approximately 14 miles north of
the country's finest white-sand beaches. New Orleans is only 3 hours
away by car.
The successful applicant(s) will have a BS in Computer Science with
outstanding academic performance, a GRE score of at least 1400, and a
strong interest in one or more of the following areas: AI, cognitive
science, human/machine interaction, or any of several other areas. The
Florida AI Graduate Student Fellowship includes a tuition-waiver and a
half-time graduate research assistantship at the IHMC while pursuing a
MS in Computer Science.

Applicants should email <kford@ai.uwf.edu> their vita and a letter of
application to:

        Dr. Kenneth Ford, Director
        Institute for Human and Machine Cognition
        University of West Florida
        Pensacola, FL 32514.
