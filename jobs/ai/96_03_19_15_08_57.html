                         RESEARCH PROGRAMMER POSITION

             The Pittsburgh Area Cognitive Tutoring (PACT) Center
                          Carnegie Mellon University

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The PACT Center is developing cognitive computer tutors for high school
mathematics.  Each of these tutors

     ~ focuses on the use of mathematical knowledge in reasoning about
       real world problem situations
     ~ emphasizes the use of modern computational tools
     ~ is constructed around a cognitive model of the knowledge students
       are aquiring

We have developed and successfully deployed the PUMP Algebra Tutor in
six city and suburban high schools in conjunction with the Pittsburgh
Urban Math Project and are expanding to new sites.

POSITION

A full-time programmer is currently needed to assist in the development
and evaluation cognitive computer tutors for geometry and algebra II. 
Responsibilities will include

     ~ programming a production system cognitive model of problem 
       solving and mathematics knowledge,
     ~ problem-solving interface development,
     ~ data analysis, and
     ~assistance in deploying and maintaining the computer tutors. 

BS or equivalent in cognitive science, cognitive psychology or computer
science and AI programming experience in Lisp is required.  Cognitive
modeling experience, production system programming, prior job experience
in cognitive science research, research programming is desireable. 

The initial appointment is for one-year, but additional years are
anticipated.  We would like to hire immediately, although we can wait as
long as May for a particularly strong candidate.

Please send resumes to Albert Corbett ( email:  corbett +@cmu.edu, FAX:
268-5576, or Human Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon
University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213).  For more information on the project
