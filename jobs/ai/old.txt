                   RESEARCH ASSISTANT POSITION 

       User Interface Design for Mechanized Theorem Provers

                     University of Glasgow


Applications are invited for a Research Assistant post available under the
EPSRC grant `User Interface Design for Mechanized Theorem Provers'.

This project will investigate the design of user interfaces to theorem
proving tools such as HOL, ERIL, or LP.  The project will employ methods of
research into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) - including cognitive science
and the psychology of programming - to formulate and test hypotheses about
the effectiveness of user interface features for theorem provers.  The aim is
to produce design principles for interfaces that will help increase the
practical usability of theorem proving systems. A distinctive feature of the
project is its interdisciplinary nature, with investigators in HCI (Phil
Gray) and theorem proving (Tom Melham and Muffy Thomas).

The post requires someone with a Ph.D. or comparable experience.  Ideally,
the appointed candidate will be an expert in the relevant HCI techniques
(including empirical evaluation), know a bit about logic and formal
reasoning, and be able to learn about theorem proving quickly.  Applicants
who are primarily theorem proving experts but willing to master the relevant
methods of HCI will also be considered. In any case, good programming ability
is required for rapid prototyping of interface ideas.

The post is for three years, starting on or after 1 November 1994 (the actual
start may be negotiated). The appointment will be on the RA 1A Scale (13,941 -
17,813 pounds p.a.) with an annual increment. The appointed researcher will be
equipped with a workstation and have access to funds for travel.

The Computing Science Department at Glasgow has an excellent research
environment.  The Department received the highest possible rating of 5 in
the most recent UK research assesment exercise. There are large and active
research groups in formal methods and HCI, with links to psychology and
graphics. The city of Glasgow is an exciting place to live, with a rich and
varied offering of theatre and the arts. There is mixture of modern and
grand Victorian architecture (and affordable housing) and the Scottish
Highlands and Islands are within easy reach.

Written applications should be sent to Dr Tom Melham, Department of Computing
Science, The University of Glasgow, Scotland, G12 8QQ, to arrive no later than
30 September 1994.  Your applicantion should include a covering letter
outlining your qualifications for the position, a Curriculum Vitae, a complete
list of publications, and the names and addresses of two referees.  Informal
inquiries are also welcome - these should also be sent to Tom Melham,
preferably by electronic mail addressed to tom@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk.

The University of Glasgow is an Equal Opportunities Employer.

To prevent any more subscription requests from appearing on the lists,
my mailing list software now looks for certain keywords (e.g.,
subscribe, signoff, unsubscribe, etc.) in the message. If it finds
any, it will redirect the message to me for approval.

It is trivial for me to add new mailing lists. If folks want to see
more specialized job announcement mailing lists (e.g., nlp-jobs,
robotics-jobs, etc.), let me know and I'll add them.

Right now the lisp-jobs mailing list has 341 members, of which about
40 have been added since the list was moved from anzus.com to
cs.cmu.edu. The ai-jobs mailing list has 38 members so far, and the
prolog-jobs mailing list has 46 members.

Reply-To: d.rosen@ieee.org
Organization: New York Medical College

Full-time position for Software Engineer/Developer with recent Degree.
Possible alternative: Part-time Experienced Software Engineer/Developer.

Starting date: Immediate/September.

A federally-funded research team at New York Medical College is
applying neural networks and advanced probabilistic/statistical
methods to improve the accuracy with which the stage (of advancement)
of cancer cases can be evaluated -- an important factor in determining
treatment.

We seek a skilled developer to take primary responsibility for the
design and implementation of our neural network software, which will
be geared towards flexible experimental use in our fast-paced research
program, as well as a simple GUI prototype of clinical production
software.  The successful candidate will work with us (medical, neural
network, and statistical researchers) to plan the best path from our
current C code to a more carefully-designed, extensible, OO approach,
perhaps with partial rapid implementation in an interpreted language,
and evaluate the possible role of other available tools and libraries.
It is expected that eventually, much of the resulting software will be
freely distributed for use in many fields.

Candidates should have demonstrably outstanding skills in designing
object-oriented software, and in C++ (or both C and some OO language)
development under the Unix[/X11] environment.  Prefer knowledge of as
many of the following as possible: neural nets, statistics, numerical
/ scientific computation, portable GUI, prototyping language (Python,
Smalltalk, Perl, S-plus, ...), MS Windows, and Unix system
administration.

New York Medical College (NYMC) is located in the community of
Valhalla, NY, just half an hour north of New York City.  The position
would be on-site, though doing some portion of the work remotely could
perhaps be arranged.

NYMC is the third-largest private medical university in the United
States. It is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Institution.
Currently we do not believe we could justify hiring an individual who
is not already authorized to work in the U.S.

If you are interested and qualified, please e-mail your resume to me
as soon as possible (plain text preferred).

A Research Assistant's post on a three-year University of Glasgow funded
research project VIPIR:  Voice Processing for Information Retrieval, a
joint project between the Computing Science and Statistics Departments.

The aim of the project is to develop voice processing techniques which will
integrate with the storage and retrieval of documents containing images and
text.   Extensive use will be made of statistical approaches, especially
the Hidden Markov Models.   The research will be based on a Sun
SPARCstation running HTK and will use some Power Macs.

Preference will be given to a candidate with a PhD in information

RRA, a major NYC consulting company, currently has full-time openings in
Los Angeles, to relocate to Lake Tahoe, Neveda.

2 Lead Engineers
Experience should include a solid grounding in OOA, OOD, C++ and Windows as
well as proven project management experience.  Experience with Oracle,
PowerBuilder, or statistical analyses would be a plus. Salary is $70-90K
depending on experience.  These two people would be resposible for a team
of 5 other more junior people.  They need to be able to handle daily project
management with minimum intervention by management (approx 1/2 day per week).
This project is estimated at 2 years development time.  We wish to move the
project up to Tahoe as soon as possible, but these two people will have some
input as to when (not if) that move occurs.  These individuals should expect
10-15 days of travel per month during the Analysis phase of subsequent
projects.

5 Junior Windows Developers
Experience should include solid C++ and Windows programming experience.
Experience with Oracle, SQL, or statistical analysis would be a plus.  Salary
ranges are estimated at 35-65K depending on experience.

1 Windows/Mac Developer
Experience should include solid C++ and Windows programming experience.  In
addition some Macintosh programming experience is required.  This person
would be spending half of their time developing a commercial project targeted
at low cost home users in Windows, and the other half maintaining an existing
Macintosh program and supporting its users.  This individual will obviously
need strong communication and support skills.  It is anticipated that this
project will be moved to Tahoe in the Summer of 1995.

1 Macintosh Developer
Experience should include a solid grounding in object-oriented software
development on the Macintosh, excellent C++ skills, and be well versed in the
Apple Human Interface Guidelines.  Experience with Genetic Algorithms,
ODBMS's, and Neural Networks would be a plus.  This person will be joining an
existing team of 2 other Developers.  This is the first project to be moved
to Tahoe, and the move will occur within 2 months of this person joining
the team.  Due to the short time here in LA, we will pay all reasonable
moving expenses for this position both to LA (if necessary) and again to
Tahoe.  Salary is $55-75K depending on experience.

	  POSITION IN MATHEMATICAL/COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
		       CITI -- Montreal, Canada


The Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI), a research
laboratory of the Canadian Department of Industry, invites
applications for a position as research scientist in mathematical and
computational linguistics.


DUTIES: Work in close cooperation with the other members of the CITI's
machine-assisted translation team in developing new techniques in
machine-assisted translation. The team includes computer scientists,
linguists and translators. More specifically, the employee will be
expected:

      1) to play a key role in the development of abstract translation
      models of the translation process, especially with respect to
      their mathematical and computational properties. The relevant
      models range from classical rule-based linguistic models (ex:
      unification grammars) to stochastic models (ex: Hidden Markov
      Models), and are meant to provide the foundation for the
      development of a new generation of translation support tools;

      2) to participate in the implementation and testing of these
      models as they are embodied in tools designed to perform tasks
      such as automatic translation checking, automatic transcription
      of spoken translations and, in the longer term, automatic
      translation of simple texts.

      3) publish the results of his/her research; monitor the relevant
      literature. 


REQUIREMENTS: Applicants should have a Ph.D. in applied mathematics or
computer science or possess a proven track record of high-quality
research in these areas.  Some previous research experience in
computational linguistics would be an important asset, as would
experience in computer programming using languages such as C, Lisp and
Prolog . While a good knowledge of both French and English would be
desirable, an excellent knowledge of either language would be
sufficient.


TERMS: The position is open for an initial term of three years with
the possibility of renewal. The CITI is located in Laval, a suburb of
Montreal. Salary will be commensurate with qualifications, as assessed
by a ministerial committee responsible for the evaluation of research
scientists. Priority will be given to Canadian citizens, but all
applications will be considered.


Applicants should send a detailed resume before October 1, 1994 to:

entire range of Oracle products, they are involved in ongoing intensive
training. In addition to their superb technical skills, our support
professionals possess excellent interpersonal skills.

A position in Worldwide Support is one for problem solvers. Our
technical support team tests and analyzes each product before our
customers ever see them. Then, once our product is installed on a
customer site, they must often deliver a detailed analysis and working
solution to our clients' problems under strict time constraints. Our
support division is the final piece of Oracle's total systems solution.

CONSULTANTS:
              Oracle Consultants provide expertise in customizing Oracle
products to meet the specific needs of clients in various industries. In
addition, our consultants often find themselves in the roles of teacher
and advisor for our customers. Currently, we have Consultants working on
state-of-the-art software systems used in everything from computer
integrated manufacturing, to fighting heart disease, to ensuring
astronaut safety in space. Our Consultants take on significant
responsibilities; the systems that we install are often critical to our
clients' business success, and our Consultants are responsible for the
final customization and implementation of those systems.

PRODUCT MANAGERS:
                Oracle Product Managers are the creative force behind
our products. They work in conjunction with our developers, salespeople,
and customers to design and position our products in the
marketplace. Each Product Manager is responsible for a specific Oracle
product, taking it from design through development and beyond. Because
Oracle continues to develop a wide spectrum of products including the
ORACLE RDBMS, networking, development tools, and applications, there are
a variety of select Product Manager opportunities.

Superb technical skills, creativity and foresight are the "trademarks"
of Oracle Product Managers.

 APPLICATION PROGRAMMER POSITION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER

Position: Software Engineer / Systems Analyst / Programmer

Location: NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA

Computer programmer needed to design and implement complex space science
support software using integrated commercial off-the-shelf applications.
Initial programming tasks will involve upgrading the existing system to use
current versions of LabVIEW (National Instruments), HyperCard (Claris) and
CLIPS (NASA) on the Macintosh platform. As the project evolves, migration to
a RISC-based platform is likely. Programming in C, Lisp, CLIPS and LabVIEW
will then be required. The user interface will be developed under X or Motif.
Whether on the Macintosh or the RISC-based platform, rapid prototyping will
first be required. As the user requirements crystallize, flight-qualified
software will be developed. Therefore, the candidate must be able to produce
robust, well-documented code quickly. Good communications skills are required
to interface to various NASA personnel as well as outside scientists,
hardware manufacturers, software vendors, contractors, etc. The candidate
will also be responsible for design and development of Mosaic project
presentation, possibly extending to other space science aspects.

The ideal candidate is a strong programmer with diverse experience on the Mac
and some UNIX environment. Experience developing in some of LabVIEW, CLIPS,
HyperCard, C, Lisp, X, Motif, Mosaic required.

Note: This is a contractor position, not a civil servant position. Green Card
or US citizenship is required.

OPERATIONS AND ENGINEERING STAFF

September 27, 1994
Prediction Company

Prediction Company is a small (currently ~12 people) Santa Fe, NM
based startup firm utilizing nonlinear forecasting technologies for
prediction and computerized trading of derivative financial
instruments. The senior technical founders of the firm are Doyne
Farmer and Norman Packard, who have worked for over ten years in the
fields of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. The technical staff
includes other senior researchers in the field. The company has the
backing of a major technically based trading firm and their partner, a
major European bank.

The Prediction Company computing environment consists of 14 Sun
Workstations and servers (SS2s, SS5s and SS10s), 8 PCs (486/66 and
Pentium) and various pieces of communications and networking gear.  We
maintain a telecommuting environment with multiple dialup lines and
the ability to run SLIP, PPP or serial X protocols over dialup
connections.  Our main development language is C++, with Perl, Tcl,
Splus and SQL being used where appropriate.

The openings described below offer a unique opportunity to get in on
the ground floor of something big.  Prediction Company is structured
as an S corporation with direct profit flow to stock holders.  All
positions include a stock options grant which will give the employee
the opportunity to reap the benefits of Prediction Company's success.
We are seeking to build a high-powered and flexible team of
scientists, engineers and domain specialists to conquer this new area
of financial engineering.

Prediction Company offers a relaxed and informal work environment.  We
are located in a converted studio on the top floor of a building in
the Guadalupe commercial district.  Our offices include a full
kitchen, shower and roof deck.  We are within easy walking distance of
many cafes, restaurants and the historical central plaza of Santa Fe.
Prediction Company does NOT have the hectic pace or high pressure of
conventional Wall Street investment firms and Santa Fe is definitely
not New York or Chicago.

Santa Fe is an almost 400 year old city (settled in 1605, one
of the oldest in the country) of ~60,000 people with a wealth of
cultural and recreational opportunities.  Known as a center for the
visual arts, Santa Fe is host to many festivals and exhibitions.
Located at 7000 feet elevation in the foothills of the Sangre De
Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico, Santa Fe has an abundance of
outdoor diversions.  Biking, hiking, camping, rock climbing, fossil
hunting and skiing (within 45 minutes at Ski Santa Fe and 90 minutes
at Taos Ski Basin) are all possible within a short drive.


Software Engineer - Research Support

          POSITION IN MATHEMATICAL/COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
                       CITI -- Montreal, Canada




The Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI), a research
laboratory of the Canadian Department of Industry, invites
applications for a position as research scientist in mathematical and
computational linguistics.

DUTIES: Work in close cooperation with the other members of the CITI's
machine-assisted translation team in developing new techniques in
machine-assisted translation. The team includes computer scientists,
linguists and translators. More specifically, the employee will be
expected:

      1) to play a key role in the development of abstract translation
      models of the translation process, especially with respect to
      their mathematical and computational properties. The relevant
      models range from classical rule-based linguistic models (ex:
      unification grammars) to stochastic models (ex: Hidden Markov
      Models), and are meant to provide the foundation for the
      development of a new generation of translation support tools;

      2) to participate in the implementation and testing of these
      models as they are embodied in tools designed to perform tasks
      such as automatic translation checking, automatic transcription
      of spoken translations and, in the longer term, automatic
      translation of simple texts.

      3) publish the results of his/her research; monitor the relevant
      literature.


REQUIREMENTS: Applicants should have a Ph.D. in applied mathematics or
computer science or possess a proven track record of high-quality
research in these areas.  Some previous research experience in
computational linguistics would be an important asset, as would
experience in computer programming using languages such as C, Lisp and
Prolog . While a good knowledge of both French and English would be
desirable, an excellent knowledge of either language would be
sufficient.


TERMS: The position is open for an initial term of three years with
the possibility of renewal. The CITI is located in Laval, a suburb of
Montreal. Salary will be commensurate with qualifications, as assessed
by a ministerial committee responsible for the evaluation of research
scientists. Priority will be given to Canadian citizens, but all
applications will be considered.


Applicants should send a detailed resume and a small sample of their
recent scientific production (article, tech. reports, etc) before
November 15, 1994 to:

This post is concerned with the development of techniques for enhancing
the representational structure of large-scale lexicons. The work will
involve surveying and collecting existing lexical resources, rapid
prototyping of enhancement techniques, testing and evaluation through
construction of pilot applications, and refinement of the techniques
into usable tools. A PhD in Computational Linguistics or a closely
related area, experience of lexical representation  and good programming
skills,  including familiarity with PROLOG and either POP11 or LISP, are
essential. Familiarity with the lexical representation language DATR, as
well as other lexical formalisms, is highly desirable. Experience of
large-scale lexicon development or acquisition, and of developing tools
for language engineering would also be an advantage.

The first position is for a computer scientist who has at least a
Bachelor's degree (preferably a Master's) in computer science, with
extensive programming experience in C and significant experience in
C++. Experience with statistical modelling and machine learning
techniques is a big plus.  Motif experience will be helpful, although
it is not required.  The candidate should also be well-versed in UNIX
and must be willing to participate in some shared administrative
responsibilities.

This first position is a combination of programming and research, so
the candidate should demonstrate a willingness and ability to program
efficiently and accurately, but he or she should also be interested in
and capable of pursuing research ideas as they come up in the course
of the project.


  *************************************************************

       Mathematician (Probability) / Experimentalist / Programmer


For the second position, a qualified candidate must have the Ph.D.
degree, preferably math, physics, computer science; with extensive
programming experience and expertise in C and significant experience
and expertise in C++. Ability to innovate approaches to applied
mathematical problems in the area of probability required. Experience
with statistical modelling within general pattern recognition field
also important. Familiarity with natural language field a plus but not
absolutely necessary. Candidate should know UNIX well and in general be
a highly expert programmer.  This is not a job for those who are
theoreticians only, but rather is for someone who is equally at home
with issues of statistical modelling theory, experimental method, and
detailed coding matters. Motif experience would be nice, though again
not required. Mentoring of less experienced (though able) researchers
is involved as well.

Salary and conditions highly competitive.

Please send cover letter, cv, and at least 3 contactable references
(covering programming abilities, for the first position; and
mathematical, experimental and programming abilities, for the second
position) to: Ezra Black (black@itl.atr.co.jp). Thank you.

   While we all wear suits and ties, our primary focus is to get the job
   done.  The hours are long, but we don't punch a clock, we don't fill
   time sheets, we don't hold long planning meetings, and we don't go
   through formal code reviews.  The atmosphere, in this way, is more like
   a startup.  And we have no tolerance for bureaucracy.

   We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate in
   employment on any basis that is prohibited by federal, state, or
   local law.

                              Positions in:  Washington D.C

             Copyright (C) 1995 by Lee Johnson International, I.R.S, INC.

Company Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our client Company's consulting practice division provides C++ and
Smalltalk-80 expertise to World Class software developers and research
labs, thus providing an opportunity to work shoulder-to-shoulder with
some of the brightest software developers in leading edge environments.
As one of our placements said, "To get a feel for the difference between
being a Developer and a Senior Consultant, think of the Developer as being
a Weaponsmith, and the latter being a Gladiator."

This consulting practice, which augments the parent Company's very
successful object-oriented system-software product, has been in
business since 1990 and is led by the founders of a large software
Company's  consulting practice division that they grew from zero to $75
million revenue and 300+ consultants before left to start this new
object-oriented consulting practice.  They hope to exceed their previous
accomplishment.  So far, they have assembled a team of 26+ extremely
competent consultants plus an outstanding sales team from the most
successful software companies in the World.  They have regional offices
in Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver,
Los Angeles Piscataway, Phoenix, San Francisco, Seattle,
Washington, D.C., London, Tokyo, Paris, Australia, and Wiesbaden, Germany.

Career Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Other fast-track, highly competent people we have placed in Senior
Consultant positions said their technical prowess has been greatly
increased by the opportunity they have to work closely with World Class
developers, as well as the parent Company's  World Class product
engineering group, has been like getting a MSCS in one year ... and that's
from people who already had a MSCS!  They also say that being in close
contact with their clients (in some cases, CEOs and Research Lab Directors)
has sharpened their business and speaking skills.  All feel that in
addition to adding to their already extensive Smalltalk skills, that after
a year into the job, they have also become an expert in the parent
Company's system-software product.  One Consultant we placed was promoted
to a Senior Consultant in about a year and one-half, and then Regional
Consulting Manager 6 months later.  Another was promoted to Regional
Consulting Manager a year after starting, then Engineering Director of a
new division a year after that. Another was given a challenging individual
assignment in Europe six months after starting!  Everyone at the Company
says their business is only limited by their ability to find high-achiever
Smalltalk experts who, like everyone in the Company, make a 150% effort.

Upward visibility possibilities and the business contacts gained are
unbelievable!  As the consulting practice grows there will be a need for
managers for all the new offices that will be opened.  Other possible
avenues could be into Sales or Engineering at the parent company.   In any
event, the experience you will be able to put on your resume will make you
EXTREMELY valuable!

Senior Consultant Job Description

The Technical Lead Consultant will divide his/her time approximately as
follows: 50% of time providing consulting in advanced Smalltalk programming
techniques and object-oriented applications design as a technical leader
on technical problems which the customer is unable to resolve
independently;  25% of time developing prototype applications and
providing technology transfer to clients;  25% of time giving formal
instruction in advanced Smalltalk and use of the Company's software
development product.  The position requires 50% - 80% travel (3-4 days per

                     functions you PERSONALLY performed (e.g., analysis,
                     design, coding, testing, etc.); (3) Description of type
                     of project, CPU, OS, languages, methodologies, tools;
                     (4) The end result (e.g., the system went into
                     production or was shipped on schedule).  You should
                     also have a Summary of Expertise at the beginning of
                     your resume that lists the GENERIC AREAS (e.g. GUI
                     design, Network Management design, etc.) that you are
                     truly expert in, as well as CPU, OS, languages, tools,
                     and methodologies.

terms to documents on the basis of semi-automatic analysis of title
and abstract.
Robust natural-language processing is one of the techniques that will
be used.

We offer positions in a challenging project in which several
international and Dutch companies have taken an active interest.

The project is foreseen to start on June 1, 1995, and is to run for

*******************************************************************************
    4 LECTURESHIPS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE ENGINEERING AT DURHAM UNIVERSITY
*******************************************************************************

The Department of Computer Science at Durham University is looking to
recruit 4new lecturers in the field of Natural Language Engineering.
The 4 lecturerswill join the Laboratory for Natural Language
Engineering, one of the foremostcentres in this subject, and actively
collaborate on the LOLITA (Large-scale,Object-based, Linguistic
Interactor, Translator and Analyser) project.

We expect to recruit 2 experienced lecturers on the B scale, and 2
junior oneson the A scale.

The experienced lecturers will have an excellent research track-record
in thefield, with substantial publications, a good PhD supervision
success rate and ahealthy fund-raising portfolio.

The junior lecturers will be researchers of clear potential and dedication.

All the lecturers must have a PhD in Computer Science or related
areas, be veryhighly motivated, ready to work in a tightly knit group
on a long term project,and able to teach at the required 'excellent'
level. They would be expected totake up their posts as soon as
possible, but not later than October 1995.

We are looking in particular for the following areas of NLE:
planning(discourse and dialogue), learning (grammatical and semantical
rules, newconcepts, optimisations), applications (large scale systems,
front-end,user-defined modes), knowledge representation and
elicitation (concept mappingacross languages and domains, supervised
and automatic analysis of corpora,encyclopedic knowledge); however,
specialists in other areas of NLE are verywelcome to apply.

The LNLE is a thriving group of 22 researchers (reader, lecturers,
RA's andpostgrads).  Our central piece of work is the LOLITA system
(see below fordetails).  The LNLE is part of the Department of
Computer Science, a rapidlyexpanding and very successful department,
whose other main wing is theinternationally renown Centre for Software
Maintenance. At the last ResearchAssessment exercise we have been
awarded a grade 4. We have excellent computingfacilities, and we are
soon to move into a substantial newly-refurbishedlocation.

Formal advertisments will shortly appear in the Guardian and the Times HES.

Informal enquiries may be addressed to:

*******************************************************************************                                THE LOLITA PROJECT

Here are a few facts about LOLITA:

- based on a conceptual graph of more than 100k nodes, compatible with WordNet;

- able to perform the fundamental morphological, grammatical,
semantical,pragmatical, discourse analysis and generation functions;

- under development for more than 8 years, at present a team of more
than 20 researchers working on it;

- mainly written in Haskell, a pure lazy functional language, with
high orderfunctions, polymorphic types and type classes (more than 45k
lines of code,corresponding to approx 450k lines in an imperative
language);

- can handle analysis of real text samples; prototype applications
includequery, dialogue, template extraction, translation and language
tutoring;

- advanced inference capabilities, including multiple inheritance,
relevantimplication, epistemic reasoning and plausible reasoning
(analogy, closedpersonal world assumption and plausible epistemic);

- processes English and Chinese; Italian and Spanish under development;

- very fast execution times (a parallel version under development);

- applications with Siemens Plessey, Rolls-Royce and other major
companies andgovernmental organisations;

- chosen by the Royal Society for its prestigious 1993 Soiree Exhibition;

- registered for the 1995 MUC-6 competition (sponsored by ARPA, the
AdvancedResearch Projects Agency of the USA).

               Computer Systems and Communications Group 
          Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India. 

POSTS :   

     The Computer Systems and Communications Group is looking for 
researchers with bright academic record both at the post-doctoral 
and  senior  levels  to further strengthen  and  consolidate  its 
speech research programme. Positions of visiting fellow, visiting 
scientist  and  visiting professor are open for  scientists  from 
outside India (NRIs as well as others) based on their  experience 
and contributions to the field. These appointments may be  looked 
upon  either  as a) stepping stones to tenure  positions  in  the 
institute  (for those intending to stay back in India), or as  b) 
means  to establish personal links and interaction with TIFR  and 
other  Indian  groups (for those wishing to spend a year  or  two 
here  and  return to their home base). The  honorarium  paid  for 
vising  appointments  is more than adequate to  cover  all  local 
expenses and accommodation. 
     
THE GROUP :

     The CSC Group has been in existence for over forty years and 
has built India's first digital computer in the mid-fifties.  The 
group  has been active in the speech area since the early  seven-
ties  and  has  made contributions in  speech  synthesis,  speech 
recognition,  speech  perception  and speech coding.  It  is  now 
recognized as the Nodal Centre for Speech Technology research  of 
the  Knowledge Based Computing Systems (KBCS) project  funded  by 
the  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the  Depart-
ment of Electronics (DOE) of the Government of India. 

     The  research  activities of the group  include,  a)  speech 
recognition, b) speech synthesis, c) speech signal processing, d) 
search  algorithms,  e) natural language processing,  f)  cursive 
script recognition and synthesis, g) coding techniques, h) paral-
lel  processing  and development of  high-speech  interconnection 
network  i)  real-time systems, j)  development  of  architecture 
compiler and k) computer visualization. 

     The  group has extensive research facilities including i)  a 
cluster  of several Sparc 10 and Vax workstations and PC 486  and 
386s,  ii)  a speech data acquisition system and a  `KAY'  speech 
analysis  workstation. In addition, the researchers can make  use 
of  the institutes' central computing facilities including a  DEC 
Alpha cluster consisting of AXP 3000/800s and 4000/720s.

THE INSTITUTE :

     The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in an  autonomous 
government  funded  research  institution  that  has  established 
itself  in the international arena in nuclear science,  mathemat-
ics,  computer  science, molecular biology, radio  astronomy  and 
science  education  over the last five decades and will  soon  be 
celebrating its Golden Jubilee. 

     The institute is located in the southern most tip of the the 
long island of Bombay and is surrounded by the sea on three sides 
and is only two miles from downtown Bombay (including the  finan-
cial,  business and cultural centres). The surroundings are  com-
pletely  free  of noise, pollution and crowds normally  found  in 
large  cities.  On-campus accommodation will  be  available  with 
modern amenities for the visiting scientists. The institute  runs 
free  bus services to downtown Bombay and the local  rail  termi-
nals.

This requires the ability to deal professionally with end users of varying 
technical experience with strict deadlines.  Third, the expert system is 
important to the company because of its impact on network quality and capital 
savings.  This is an opportunity for your work to be used on a real world
problem with significant impact.

The following qualifications are required for the position:
	- an MS or PhD in Computer Science/Engineering, or a related field
	- Substantial Lisp programming experience
	- Experience with Sun Workstations

Senior Software Developers - Agent-Oriented, Distributed Real-Time Systems

The Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) is seeking to
appoint a Senior Software Developer to work on strategic, leading-edge
projects in the area of Distributed Real-Time Agent-Oriented Systems.

Candidates must have a solid grounding in Computer Science, possess
excellent C++ skills using Unix, and have a proven track-record in
software development, using object-oriented methodologies, preferably
the Booch methodology.

AAII performs strategic research and development in AI. Systems developed 
at AAII include a real-time fault diagnosis system for the space shuttle, 
an air traffic management system which ensures optimal runway usage under 
complex constraints, an intelligent telecommunications management system, 
and an advanced simulation system for the RAAF. These are all based on 
original research and product development carried out at AAII over the past 
six years. These projects have culminated in the development of a new, C++
based agent-oriented programming environment, dMARS.

In dMARS, agents are intelligent computer processes which have the capacity 
to reason about their goals, how to achieve them, when to abandon them, and 
so on. The dMARS system allows for many such agents to be distributed and
controlled transparently across multiple machines.

Because of the challenging nature of the work undertaken, AAII is seeking
world-class technical staff to tackle its new projects. You will be working 
on some of the most exciting and innovative projects being undertaken in 
Australia, and will be part of a highly-motivated team which has a diverse
range of skills. The Institute is a very dynamic environment with much
interaction between the members of the different projects, leading to a
valuable exchange of ideas.

The current role, requires extensive industrial/commercial experience in a
software engineering environment. As a guide, a minimum of 5 years in a lead
role would be expected. As well, substantial interpersonal skills are sought
as the role requires a mentoring/leading approach within a team environment.

Salary: negotiable, commensurate with the applicant's experience and ability.  
All applications will be treated in strictest confidence.

Written applications, including a current resume and names of two referees,
should be forwarded to the address shown below. Alternatively, you are welcome
to email your application to: jobs@aaii.oz.au.

	Personnel Department,
	The Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute,
	Level 6, 171 La Trobe Street,

Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

There was a bug in the mailing list filter that prevented it from
filtering out certain kinds of subscription requests. This bug has
been fixed.

Also, the mailing lists are large enough now (450 on AI-Jobs, 435 on
Lisp-Jobs, 152 on Prolog-Jobs) that I cannot track down mail bounces.
If mail to your email address bounces for any reason, the email
address will be removed from the mailing list. If, after a service
failure at your end, you find yourself no longer receiving job
announcements, try resubscribing. If your mailer tacks on a bad return
address, use the MAIL command to specify a reliable email address. For
example,  
   mail foo@cs.bar.edu
   subscribe ai-jobs John Foo, Bar University
will set up a subscription for foo@cs.bar.edu and send a confirmation
message to foo@cs.bar.edu.

Subject: Admin: Replace lists with newsgroups?
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

A subscriber has suggested that the AI-related jobs mailing lists be 
replaced or augmented with a newsgroup or newsgroups. Since I do not
have the facilities for a bidirectional email/news gateway, nor do I have
the time to write one, this would probably mean replacement. 

Before there is any discussion of this proposal (and such discussion
will NOT take place on this list), I would like to hear the answers to
two questions. Please email your responses to me directly at mkant@cs.cmu.edu.

   1. Would a change from a mailing list to a newsgroup adversely
      affect any of the list subscribers? Are there any subscribers
      who do not have access to netnews, or who strongly prefer to
      receive the job announcements in email form? Are there any other
      good reasons to remain as a mailing list? 

   2. Are any of you willing to take responsibility for the RFD and CFV
      process? I do not have the time to do this myself, but would be
      available to review the RFD and CFV posts before they went out.

My interpretation of the proposal is that it would replace the mailing
lists with three (unmoderated) newsgroups:
   comp.ai.jobs
   comp.lang.lisp.jobs
   comp.lang.prolog.jobs
The charters for these newsgroups would be for job postings, graduate
fellowship announcements, and postdoctoral position announcements.
Some issues to be discussed in the RFD include: posting of resumes, and
minimal moderation (to remove irrelevant posts and ensure that subject
lines are properly formatted).

Also, if this proposal does go forward, I'd like to see a proposal for
creating the following (unrelated) newsgroups that I think would be
equally useful:
   comp.ai.announce.books         Announcements of new AI books & publications
   comp.ai.announce.conferences   Announcements of AI conferences
The latter is necessary because news.announce.conferences is
essentially defunct, and even when it wasn't, the newsgroup needed
splitting anyway.

*       an ability to take on some management, training and
        supervision roles
*       good socials skills, particularly an ability to communicate
        with clients
*       an ability to work quickly and effectively, willing to work
        hard on occasions to meet tight deadlines
CRL is situated 12 miles west of London and is housed in a prestige
purpose built complex. Practicalities dictate that candidates are
likely to be currently UK-based.

Subject: Admin: Results of mail/news survey.
Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

I received 68 messages requesting that we retain the mailing lists and
not switch to a newsgroup. Also, nobody volunteered to administer the
newsgroup creation process. So we will be sticking with mailing lists.

I've appended a summary of the comments I received to this message.
In addition, I received mail from several people who found their
current job through the list, and from several employers who found an
employee through the list.

Several people also commented that they liked my Prime Time Freeware
for AI book/CD-ROM.

One person asked me to archive the messages somewhere in the AI
Repository's Web pages. This is already being done; I just
forgot to announce it to the list. All postings sent to the list are
automatically archived in appropriate subdirectories of
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/
The equivalent web page is
   http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/Groups/AI/html/other/jobs.html
Right now posts are given a filename based on the date and time received.

My decision is to remain with the status quo. If I ever decide to
create a newsgroup, it will be in addition to the mailing lists, and
will be moderated. There wouldn't be much additional effort on my part
(aside from the newsgroup creation bureaucracy), because posts to a
moderated newsgroup get sent to the moderator. 

Incidentally, I get some of the job announcements from newsgroups. I
wrote a PERL program that scans several newsgroups every night for
AI-related job postings, and saves them to a directory. About half of
them are junk, headhunters, or repeats, so I delete them, and the
remainder get posted about once a week. The rest of the announcements
are direct from the employers. It takes me only about 5 to 10 minutes a
week to manage the lists because of this automation, and most of that
time is spent dealing with bounces. 

Unfortunately, the scanner isn't sophisticated enough to detect
certain kinds of AI-related job announcements. For example, it cannot
retrieve AI Planning jobs, because the word "planning" is in about 75%
of all job postings (i.e., jobs that require employees with good
planning skills).

Here is a paraphrase of some of the comments I received:

   +  Can't read netnews. 

   +  Many employers do not permit employees to read newsgroups, but
      they do allow email.

   +  Employers who do permit netnews, do not always carry a full
      feed. Employees might feel very awkward asking them to carry the
      new newsgroup.

   +  Doesn't have the time to read news regularly.

   +  Mail messages are easier to redistribute.

   +  More likely to read messages via email.

   +  Mailing list has a high signal to noise ratio because it is
      effectively moderated.

   +  Mail is received quicker and in a more timely fashion than news.
      News posts are often delayed by days.

   +  News feed is unreliable, especially overseas.

   +  When actively searching for a job, mail is better.

   +  News expires and mail doesn't.

   +  Mail can be batch downloaded and read offline, keeping costs down.

   +  Can't use mail filtering tools with a newsgroup.

   +  The minimal effort in subscribing to a mailing list keeps riffraff out.

   +  Employer: Gets better and higher quality response from mailing list.

   +  Too much volume in news.

   +  If we switch to a newsgroup, it must be moderated. An unmoderated
      newsgroup would have more junk and noise than real announcements. 

   +  The volume of posts might not support three newsgroups, so may
      have just comp.ai.jobs.

   +  Call the newsgroup comp.ai.announce.jobs to prevent it from
      being used as a gripe forum.

   +  Permitting resumes is a bad idea -- it would increase the noise.

driving their own research projects in areas relevant to the group, are
all encouraged to apply.

The research of the group focuses on user-adaptive interfaces,
multimodal communication, large-scale natural-language-processing
systems, application of statistical and machine-learning techniques to
natural-language processing, and text and document processing. Current
projects deal with user-adaptive help systems, speech-to-speech
translation, integration of natural-language and speech technology,
spoken-language interfaces to virtual realities, dialogue models for
voice-controlled telecom services, support systems for human
translation, and information filtering.

SICS is located just north of Stockholm and consists of over 50
professionals plus students and visitors. It is a non-profit research
foundation sponsored by the Swedish National Board for Technical and
Industrial Development and several major Swedish companies. In addition
to language engineering and human-computer interaction, SICS has a
strong position in distributed and parallel computer systems, logic
programming, high-speed networks, formal design methods, software
methodology, knowledge-based systems, neural networks and virtual
realities. SICS has close contacts with university- and institute-based
research both inside Sweden and in Europe, North America and Japan. More

JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

Canon Research Centre Europe Ltd
Guildford, UK

Canon Research Centre Europe is looking for new recruits for its
Natural Language group. We are looking for people who will fit well
into the group on a permanent basis, rather than for a specific
project. A good computer science or linguistics background is
important, as are excellent programming skills. Top quality computer
scientists without any previous experience of Natural Language
Processing are encouraged to apply, as well as people with experience
in the area.

For more information about these openings, and about Canon Research
Centre Europe in general, our URL is http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/.

Our work ranges from long-term basic research to solving specific
problems quickly, and from interactive spoken dialogue systems to
large-scale text translation. We are currently embarking on embedding
our Natural Language software in realistic hardware platforms.
Skills/expertise relevant to this area would be useful.

Creativity and a flair for innovative work are essential.

Canon Research Centre Europe has been on the University of Surrey
Research Park since 1988. We doubt that you would be disappointed by
salary, equipment or working environment. Our recruitment policy is one
of equal opportunity.

Please note that you need to have the right to work in Britain. If you
are not a citizen of one of the member states of the European Union,
please check whether you are eligible before applying.

If you are interested, please mail a detailed CV to

        nljob@canon.co.uk

Plain text is preferred, but other formats (PostScript, LaTeX,
Framemaker, troff, etc.) are acceptable. Alternatively, you can send a
paper copy to:

        Kazuko Cooper (NL)
        Canon Research Centre Europe

        tel: +44-1483-448844
        fax: +44-1483-448845

There is no specific deadline for applications for these positions,
which will be processed as they arrive until suitable people have been
found. We expect to be hiring about 3 more people over the course of
1995.

Subject: HELP!!! Indexer Needed!!!
Date: 1 Apr 1995 19:40:34 GMT
Organization: Northeastern University, College of Computer Science

I am in dire need of someone who can put together a solid and effective
index for a somewhat advanced book on Fuzzy Logic. I am submitting a bid
to package a job, and am including about $1300 for an indexer (may be
negotiable). The best situation would be if I could find someone who had
both experience indexing and knows something about Fuzzy Logic, rather
than just someone who would be able to submit a key-word list. 

The book will about 600 pages, and the job will need to be done fairly
quickly (like 7-to-10 day turn-around), to probably go out around the last
week of April.

If anyone knows someone who can help me and might be interested, please
have them send me e-mail that includes their name, phone number, address,
and some idea of their experience in both in indexing and in computer
language and terminology.

Thanks in advance for any help.

			Signal Analysis Specialist
			Programmer, Systems Designer

The HAL Trust is a research and development project funded to implement
a speech recognition system that incorporates a cognitive-based-phonological
strategy.  The project has implemented the cognitive strategy and produced 
encouraging results.  The approach seems to yield a highly efficient and
effective back end to a recognition system.

We are currently seeking to obtain greater expertise in the fields of signal 
processing, programming and computational science.  We anticipate hiring at 
least one full-time researcher-developer.  The near term objective is to 
expand and complete the development of a full pilot system.  To accomplish 
this we seek the expertise required for the development of traditional front
ends to recognition systems, such as knowledge of (acoustic) signal processing 
techniques.  In particular we seek a strong creative ability to tailor front 
end development to the pattern requirements of the cognitive-based strategies.
We are open to exploration of traditional methodologies such as hidden Markov 
models but would also value ideas on alternative approaches.  Programming 
skills and computational sophistication are highly desirable.
	
We envision an intense research and development effort over the next 6-12 
months.  The position would provide the opportunity to make a significant 
research contribution to the overall design of the system.  In addition, the
objective of the project is to develop a commercial project.  The trust has 
significant managerial expertise involved in
the project.  This creates an opportunity for growth and long
term involvement for a suitably qualified individual.

At present the project is based at the University of London.  The position
is for an initial period of 6-12 months at the University facilities with the
potential for a longer term commitment at the end of one year.  The position
is available immediately.  Salary is commensurate with expertise and the cost 
of living in London.  For further information please contact:

ideal candidate should be fluent in a variety of systems,
architectures and programming languages, understand user interface
tools, especially some of the new modalities of communication (speech,
gesture, handwriting) and most of all, be committed to making a strong
contribution to the next generation of user interfaces and intelligent
systems.  Specifically, you should have the following:

EDUCATION: MS Computer Science with substantial work experience (PhD
ok too!)  Experience with speech recognition, gesture recognition,
handwriting recognition, and/or natural language processing required.
Knowledge of HMMs and neural nets is higly desirable. 
Experience with geographic mapping systems, logic programming, distributed
databases, and networking would also be desirable.  Finally, knowledge
of CORBA would  be a big plus.
  
SKILLS: PC's: 	MS Windows and Visual Basic,  OLE,  Prolog, C, C++
	 Unix:  X-Windows, C, C++, Prolog, shell and Perl scripts, WCL,
		Tcl and Tk
 		
TASK: You will be responsible for building next generation multimodal
interfaces, implemented in an intelligent agent architecture.  Users
will state their needs through a multimodal interface integrating
speech recognition, natural language processing, handwriting,
gestures, and direct manipulation.  You will build an architecture
allowing each modality to be used whenever  appropriate and to supply
constraints to the others.   The design of the interface will be guided
by ongoing usability experiments, whose systems you will also support.

The interface will be be part of an intelligent agent architecture,
which allows distributed information resources operating on multiple
platforms to communicate and cooperate over the Internet in addressing
users' needs.  The architecture will span multiple platforms (PC's,
Unix, Macs, PDA's) and network bandwidths. To maximize generality, it
will take advantage of emerging standards such as CORBA.

Salary and benefits will be competitive.

funding bodies to support the development of the LR most urgently
needed.  Language Resources include all data necessary for language
engineering, such as monolingual and multilingual lexica, text
corpora, speech databases and terminologies.

The Association has members drawn from every country in the European
Union and expects to attract subscribers from throughout the world. At
present, ELRA is financed from membership fees and grants; in the
future the Association will derive income from the sale of licences to
users world wide. After an initial start-up period of four years, it
is planned that the Association will be financially independent and
self-supporting.

The Association is seeking a Chief Executive to manage the activities
of the Association.  This person is likely to be an independent

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP
University of Pennsylvania, Philadelpha PA

TraumAID is a joint project of the University of Pennsylvania, Medical College 
of Pennsylvania and University of Delaware, that aims at providing real-time 
decision support during the initial definitive management of multiple trauma
in Emergency Centers. The project is seeking a post-doctoral fellow in
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING to begin in the Summer or Fall of 1995.

TraumAID is an on-going, multi-disciplinary project that has involved expert
system reasoning, planning, plan recognition, natural language generation,
physics-based modelling and computer animation. The post-doctoral fellow will
be expected to contribute to a newly-funded study of how computer-generated
decision-support can be effectively communicated to clinical personnel so that 
it influences their decisions and actions; this differs significantly from
otherwork on decision-support interfaces in that the clinical personnel are
attending to patients and not to a computer screen. We are seeking a
fellow with  experience in at least one area central to the project and
willingness to gain experience in others. Relevant areas include observational
studies of human communication, Natural Language generation, speech synthesis,
and discourse processing.

The Research Associates will interact closely with faculty and graduate
students, and will be able to take advantage of all resources of the
University, including close ties with Penn's Institute for Research in
Cognitive Science. Initial appointments will be for one year, but we expect
the position to be renewable for a second year as well.

Applicants should send a vita, including the names of at least three
references, by e-mail to bonnie@central.cis.upenn.edu. If e-mail is
impossible, hard-copies may be mailed to:

	Professor Bonnie Lynn Webber
	Dept of Computer & Information Science
	University of Pennsylvania
	200 South 33rd Street, 5th floor
	Philadelphia PA 19104-6389

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled. The University
of Pennsylvania is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Employer.

Wanted: We're looking for professionals who can apply techniques in data
        analysis, machine learning and decision-theoretic reasoning to
        real-world industrial applications.  A Masters or PhD in computer
        science or equivalent experience is preferred.  An ability to interact
        with clients to determine their needs would be very helpful.
        Top-notch programming ability is a definite plus.

==============================================================================

"Some of the world's greatest software developers work at Harlequin."

We are world leaders in symbolic processing, electronic publishing and
related software applications.  We write in C, C++, Dylan, Lisp, ML,
Postscript, Prolog, and whatever else it takes.  Including English.

Harlequin's Electronic Publishing Division specialises in
Postscript-compatible technology, producing versions of its own software
for previewing images and text on screen or printing them either directly
to hard copy or indirectly through a pre-press system.

The Symbolic Processing Division develops software that helps to raise the
level at which computers appear to operate by enabling computers to
represent, change, manipulate, and communicate ideas, relationships, plans,
and implications.  From this environment come Harlequin's powerful software
development tools, such as LispWorks, Knowledgeworks and CLIM, together
with our unique application delivery tool, Transducer, as well as
Harlequin's own vertical market applications.

"We promise not to train you, but be ready to learn fast.  And never be
afraid to ask how, or why, or why not."

What do you get if you take a bunch of compiler writers and application
programmers, add some special hardware developers, and mix together with
color imaging technologists, technical authors, customer support officers,
product managers (and product marketing managers), QA administrators, sales
and marketing, and a liberal smattering of other talented people?  You get
a global computing company that works together (in harmony mostly, but not
always) to produce the world's finest software.

Harlequin started life in Cambridge, UK in 1986.  Today we have two offices
in Cambridgeshire, one in Manchester, an office in Sydney, Australia, and
three U.S. facilities in Cambridge, MA, Menlo Park, CA, and Seattle, WA.
Further operations are planned as we grow to some 250 staff world wide.

             Research Assistant/Associate in

             Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition


Applications are invited for the post of Research Assistant or Research
Associate to work on an EPSRC-sponsored project. The project is
aimed at enhancing the HTK-based large vocabulary speaker independent
continuous speech recognition system developed by the Cambridge University
Engineering Department Speech Group. The appointment will be for 18 month,
in the first instance, starting as soon as possible.

The HTK-based large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system
has a vocabulary of up to 65,000 words, uses cross-word context dependent
HMM models and N-gram language models. The current project is working
on increasing the robustness of the system.  Aspects of this work include
speaker adaptation, noise and channel compensation and adaptive language
modelling.

Candidates should have a good first degree in a relevant discipline and
preferably have a higher degree. The post requires experience of HMM based
speech recognition, especially the aspects mentioned above, C programming,
and use of a UNIX environment. Familiarity with HTK is a distinct
advantage.

Further details and an application form can be obtained from Mavis Barber,
Engineering Dept, Trumpington Street, Cambridge, Tel:  +44-1223-332752,
Fax: +44-1223-332662 or email: mavis@eng.cam.ac.uk. The closing date
for applications is 31st May 1995.

Prospective candidates are also encouraged to contact me directly if they
wish to discuss the project further.

Subject: US-GA-Atlanta: DOCUMENT IMAGE UNDERSTANDING, Senior Tech Lead
Date: 9 May 1995 20:05:35 GMT
Organization: FrontRunners, Inc.

==========================================================
POSITION SUMMARY:

An established advanced technology development unit has an 
extremely attractive, newly created position open for a 
senior candidate with proven expertise in DOCUMENT IMAGE 
PROCESSING. Operating as part of a larger image processing 
group, this individual will lead new commercial product 
development efforts and champion corporate-wide, high-
profile document image processing applications.

Flexible, well funded environment of multiple small teams.

Location: Atlanta. 
==========================================================

BACKGROUND:

This group as a whole has the mission of applying leading 
edge technologies to corporate thrusts within product 
divisions. Multiple well-funded projects are already 
underway involving advanced image understanding, image 
processing, and tracking techniques. However, corporate 
divisions also have a critical interest in DOCUMENT IMAGE 
UNDERSTANDING applications in particular; although there is 
an enormous need for robust item processing techniques, the 
development group is missing a senior champion for existing 
document IU technologies, both to lead efforts in augmenting 
the existing technology base, and to aid product divisions 
in applying existing solutions. E.g., early prototypes of 
some core solutions have been created, but have not been 
tuned or tested for robustness.


QUALIFICATIONS:

* Advanced degree in CS/EE or related discipline, or a BS 
with excellent experience.
	
* 3+ years of applied document image understanding 
experience, preferrably in real world applications. A 
broad background in image understanding and image 
processing techniques is highly desirable.

* Significant team leadership skills/experience

* Creativity combined with pragmatism: emphasis is on 
demonstrating workable solutions and on 
application/adaptation of existing technology in new 
areas.


RESPONSIBILITIES:

* To lead the technical team in developing a range of 
document IU projects, including several custom projects 
to handle forms processing for insurance, banking, and 
government.

* This is a initially a technical lead position focused on 
cooperative concept development and prototyping. However, 
with growing familiarity with company, responsibilities 
are expected to rapidly evolve from technical leadership 
into project management. Will eventually be responsible 
for championing Document IU technologies corporate-wide. 
Initiative is recognized and highly valued within the 
mother group.


COMMENTS:

* This is an outstanding opportunity for a high-energy 
individual to move into a senior, project management 
position rapidly. Further, the current market situation 
is such that any initiatives within the document image 
understanding area are likely to be fully internally 
funded.

* Work permit required.

Subject: SWITZERLAND-CSCS: Research Position in Applied AI
Date: 8 May 1995 11:38:10 GMT
Organization: Swiss Scientific Computing Center CSCS

Centro Svizzero di Calcolo Scientifico (CSCS), located in  Manno,
Ticino,  part  of  the  Swiss  Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich has an immediate opening for a

                        RESEARCH SCIENTIST

with background in Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The main part of the work consists in research and support in the
application  of  AI  to  parallel  programming,  high-performance
computing, and scientific computing.

In the framework of the Priority Program Informatics  (SPPIF)  of
the  Swiss National Science Foundation, the CSCS conducts applied
research on a project on intelligent programming environments for
massively  parallel  programming.   The  basic  idea  consists in
combining domain-oriented  specification  formalisms,  artificial
intelligence  methods,  and  program  synthesis techniques into a
high-level   programming   environment   with    user-transparent
parallelization of applications. The project started in late 1992
and it is the responsibility of the new collaborator to  continue
the AI part of the project.

Other duties include support and consulting for other projects at
CSCS.  Artificial Intelligence has been identified as a strategic
direction for CSCS. It is the new  collaborator's  responsibility
to  build  up  competence  in  AI (in particular intelligent user
interfaces,  knowledge-  based   software   engineering,   expert
systems,  and data mining), to consult developers in the field of
embedding AI  into  their  applications,  and  to  establish  and
maintain  contacts  with  related institutions in Switzerland and
abroad.

CSCS is looking for a skilled and experienced computer  scientist
with   solid  education  and  experience  in  AI.   Autonomy  and
initiative are considered  as  key  aspects  of  the  candidate's
personality.  Good  programming  knowledge (preferably C/C++) and
familiarity with rule-based expert system shells  are  mandatory.
Knowledge of parallel programming is a plus, but not required.

CSCS offers excellent working conditions.

Please send cover letter and resume to:

ITT AEROSPACE/COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION
 
ITT Aerospace/Communications Division (A/CD), headquartered in Fort
Wayne, Indiana, is a unit of ITT Defense and Electronics.  A/CD is a
world leader in three major high-technology business areas:
 
FORWARD AREA BATTLEFIELD COMMUNICATIONS
 
With the U.S. Army, A/CD developed the current standard combat net radio
for the Army and Marine Corps, the Single Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System (SINCGARS).  SINCGARS is now entering its fourth generation
in manpack, vehicular and airborne configurations.  The radios are
produced in ITT's world-class Fort Wayne manufacturing facility.  The
plant has earned the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command's
contractor performance certification and the internationally-recognized
ISO-9001 registration for the design, production and repair of
communications equipment.
 
ITT SINCGARS' frequency-hopping VHF technology makes it virtually
jam-proof.  During the 1991 Middle East conflict U.S. Marine Corps
communicators reported ITT SINCGARS was the only combat net radio that
could not be jammed by hostile forces.
 
The system has consistently performed well beyond U.S. Army
specifications  under combat conditions in Desert Shield/Desert Storm,
Operation Just Cause in Panama and the Korean demilitarized zone.
According to U.S. Department of Defense reports the radios "...displayed
an astounding 7,000 hours
mean time between failure (MTBF) during Desert Storm."  U.S. Army
specifications require 1,250 hours MTBF.
 
About 75,000 SINCGARS have been built for the U.S. Army and Marines and
national defense forces in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  Its latest
generation, the SINCGARS TCS, is a data-capable communications system
with the ability to interface with a wide variety of US communications
systems.
 
SATELLITE SYSTEMS
 
A/CD develops and produces high-performance satellite systems.  The
company's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and High Resolution
Infrared Radiation Sounder provide quality meteorological imagery and
data from the low-Earth orbit NOAA Advanced TIROS-N satellites.
 
ITT Imagers and Sounders are the heart of the latest NOAA Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite series - GOES-Next.  A/CD also
manages the navigation packages for all U.S. Global Positioning System
satellites.
 
SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES
 
ITT A/CD's San Diego engineering center is internationally recognized
for research and development in speech recognition and speaker
verification technologies.
 
ITT's SPEAKERKEY(TM) speaker verification system is being licensed for a
wide variety of applications, notably as a low-cost, reliable home
incarceration monitoring system.  SPEAKERKEY is also useful in
safeguarding computer networks and long-distance telephone systems.

MOBIT (MOdel Based Intelligent Training)

Introduction

The Mobit project is part of the Intelligent Systems Integration
Programme, ISIP, and comprises four partners, Scottish Nuclear,
Digital, Scomagg and Heriot Watt University.

Background

Traditional computer based training, CBT, systems are currently being
used for some training tasks but they have many disadvantages. CBTs
are very inflexible and cannot cope well with incremental changes in
system operation, nor are they suitable for some complex tasks. MOBIT
sets out to tackle some of the problems of CBTs by creating both a
flexible and a widely applicable system.

Interacting models of the domain, the trainee and a domain expert are
used. If any changes to the system or to the training requirements of
the system are required then the appropriate models can be adjusted to
give the updated system without a complete redevelopment of the
system. This model based approach also permits a flexible training
program to allow training to be performed at the appropriate pace for
each trainee or for targetted retraining. Successful completion of the
project will provide a powerful flexible system.

The project objectives are to

   Develop a generic model based training system
   Produce a supporting specification methodology
   Produce a set of software tools
   Identify and support multiple representations of the domain expertise
   knowledge
   Construct two demonstrator systems .

Prior to building the demonstrators a demonstrator prototype PROMO is
being constructed.

        Speech Recognition Systems Position Available

           International Computer Science Institute

                        Berkeley CA


The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley,
California now has a position available in the Realization Group.  This
is a staff position with a focus on speech recognition system design.
The job will involve both research and development. Applicants should
have several years of experience in designing and writing speech
recognition software, and have an interest in developing recognizers
that incorporate results from basic research within the group. It would
be best if the applicant also had experience in speech research as
well, although development experience is the more important
qualification.  Ordinarily, applicants will have a Ph.D., although
strong professional experience can substitute for this requirement.

The Realization group at ICSI does a combination of hardware, software,
and algorithms for research and development of systems for speech
processing and other machine implementations of human signal processing
and pattern recognition.  In the past, much of the emphasis has been on
hybrid neural network/ hidden Markov model based speech recognition,
robust recognition in the context of additive and convolutional noise,
study of robust properties of the human auditory system, and research
into the interaction of statistical sequence recognition with robust
signal processing.  Hardware and software tools also continue to be
developed in the group, leading to strong capabilities for training
with computationally intensive algorithms.  The group includes a strong
group of Berkeley CS and EE graduate students, as well as by fruitful
collaborations with other researchers (including Greenberg from
Berkeley, Bourlard from Belgium, Hermansky from OGI, Cohen and Franco
from SRI, and Robinson from Cambridge U). The group is led by Nelson
Morgan.

ICSI is an independent, non-profit basic research institute affiliated
with the University of California campus in Berkeley, California, and
is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

                  Intuitive Interfaces to Information 
              Systems Project--The Role of Human Language

Information systems now occupy a position of central importance 
in our economy, and successful business competition depends 
critically on effective and efficient processing of information.  
The importance of information processing and of the development of a 
National Information Infrastructure (NII) is acknowledged throughout 
industry, and the importance of a strong NII to the nation's 
well-being is recognized and strongly supported at top levels of 
government.  But, in order to provide full benefit from and full 
access to these information services, significant advances are needed 
in ease-of-use.  Natural and intuitive interfaces are required to 
empower the user, to exploit the potential of information services, 
and to bring information access to everybody.

Human language is clearly the medium and human language technology 
is the key to fulfill this need.  A host of potential application 
areas require human language interfaces.  Generic examples include 
information retrieval based upon natural language queries, machine 
translation of text from one language to another, automatic 
extraction of information from text for creating databases, 
dictation of text by voice, and domain-specific spoken language 
understanding for natural interactions with information systems.  
These applications represent a wave of potential services that will 
be enabled by natural intuitive interfaces using human language 
technology.  The I3S study was created to support and foster this 
vital development.

*************************************************************
The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation

Information technology is advancing at break-neck speeds.
Competition is going global. Business success demands innovation,
agility, and the right strategic partners working together to
get further faster and at less expense.

It was this philosophy-the value of cooperation-that led ten
major U.S. corporations to launch MCC more than a decade ago,
and it continues to be MCC's guiding philosophy today. Shrinking
margins and limited resources make consortial research more
valuable today than ever before, providing a proven strategy for
accelerating technology development and leveraging scarce R&D
resources.

Today's MCC is a rich environment for multidisciplinary
research and development, technology integration, and
alliance-building, with a pervasive commitment to accelerating
the creation, commercialization, and adoption of innovation in
information technologies and advanced electronics. MCC's objective
is to enhance the ability of member companies to harness the
power of information technology to attain sustainable competitive
advantage.

Founded by major computer and semiconductor manufacturers, MCC's
membership has diversified to include a broad range of high-profile
corporations from electronics, computers, aerospace, semiconductors,
and related industries, as well as major end users of advanced
technology. MCC's membership reflects the full range of companies
that are vital to the life cycle of information technology and
advanced electronic products. Active involvement of small- and medium-
sized manufacturers, along with well-established alliances with
government research and development agencies and leading universities,
allows MCC's partners to make cost-effective use of R&D resources.

               of Information using Semantic Agents

              Project Manager Position Description

Project summary:
InfoSleuth is developing and deploying new technologies for 
finding information in both corporate and external networks, 
such as those based on the emerging National Information 
Infrastructure (NII).  The InfoSleuth research is based on 
MCC's acclaimed Carnot technology, developed in a collaborative 
project over the last 4 years.  Carnot has been successfully 
used to integrate heterogeneous corporate information resources.  
The InfoSleuth Project will investigate the use of Carnot 
technology in a more dynamically changing environment, such as 
the Internet, where new information sources are constantly being 
added and for which there is no formal control of the registration 
of new information sources.  In this type of environment, traditional 
techniques for expressing and optimizing database queries are 
inadequate because of the rapidly changing schema information and 
the fuzzy nature of the queries.  InfoSleuth will build on Carnot's 
semantic modeling capabilities to enable "deep" descriptions of 
available information sources, and InfoSleuth will deploy semantic 
agents to carry out distributed, coordinated, self-adapting search 
algorithms.

TECHNICAL  REQUIREMENTS 

- Extensive knowledge of both research and commercial products in 
  a number of the following technology areas: agent-based computing, 
  database management, information retrieval, object-oriented programming 
  languages, distributed processing, and artificial intelligence

- Established track record as an innovative researcher in the 
  project area.

- Demonstrated ability to lead a world class research team made 
  up of MCC personnel, personnel at sponsoring companies, university 
  professors and students, and collaborators at other companies.

- Ability to market current and proposed programs to potential sponsors.
  The InfoSleuth Project will be expanded with new sponsors throughout 
  1995 and early 1996. There is a potential for initiation of additional 
  MCC projects related to InfoSleuth in late 1995 and beyond.

- Experience in the management of consortium projects. Sponsors of 
  the InfoSleuth Project will be a diverse group of companies and 
  government agencies with diverse goals for their return on investment 
  as a result of their sponsorship of the project. Sponsors will 
  include both users of InfoSleuth technology who want to improve 
  their organizational productivity in the short term while waiting 
  for commercial InfoSleuth products to emerge and organizations that 
  will be developing commercial InfoSleuth products. 

PROJECT  MANAGER'S  GENERAL  RESPONSIBILITIES 

1. Technical leadership
   - Provide the technical direction necessary to develop 
     plans for studies/projects which respond customer needs.
   - Serve as a senior technical contributor to the study/project.
   - Establish responsibilities for subordinate staff in a manner 
     which maximizes the use of available technical talent.
   - Formulate plans for follow-on consortium projects or product 
     developments as appropriate.
2. Business Development
   - Identify, qualify, and take the steps necessary to close 
     deals with potential study/project sponsors.
   - Prepare proposals and "white papers" for government contracts 
     which represent new business opportunities or ways to gain 
     additional leverage for existing projects.	
3. Administrative Management
   - Recruit, develop, and retain a competent and motivated staff.
   - Monitor and control project expenditures to insure adherence 
     to budget.
   - Develop contingency plans modifying staffing levels, project 
     deliverables, and other direct costs as necessary to respond 
     to changing financial conditions.
   - Ensure that MCC policies are understood by the project staff 
     and followed.
4. Customer Satisfaction
   - Ensure the timeliness and quality of study findings and project 
     deliverables.
   - Contribute to effectively reporting findings and transferring 
     technology to sponsors.
   - Maintain close liaison with sponsors to understand changing 
     needs and expectations.

*************************************************************
The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation

Information technology is advancing at break-neck speeds.
Competition is going global. Business success demands innovation,
agility, and the right strategic partners working together to
get further faster and at less expense.

It was this philosophy-the value of cooperation-that led ten
major U.S. corporations to launch MCC more than a decade ago,
and it continues to be MCC's guiding philosophy today. Shrinking
margins and limited resources make consortial research more
valuable today than ever before, providing a proven strategy for
accelerating technology development and leveraging scarce R&D
resources.

Today's MCC is a rich environment for multidisciplinary
research and development, technology integration, and
alliance-building, with a pervasive commitment to accelerating
the creation, commercialization, and adoption of innovation in
information technologies and advanced electronics. MCC's objective
is to enhance the ability of member companies to harness the
power of information technology to attain sustainable competitive
advantage.

Founded by major computer and semiconductor manufacturers, MCC's
membership has diversified to include a broad range of high-profile
corporations from electronics, computers, aerospace, semiconductors,
and related industries, as well as major end users of advanced
technology. MCC's membership reflects the full range of companies
that are vital to the life cycle of information technology and
advanced electronic products. Active involvement of small- and medium-
sized manufacturers, along with well-established alliances with
government research and development agencies and leading universities,
allows MCC's partners to make cost-effective use of R&D resources.

                RESEARCH POSITION FOR A COMPUTATIONAL LINGUIST

We are advertising a research position in the VERBMOBIL project, which
is funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF).
VERBMOBIL is concerned with the development of a portable
speech-to-speech translation system for "face-to-face"-communication.

The VERBMOBIL-subproject at the Department of Computational
Linguistics in Tuebingen is concerned with Semantic Evaluation and
Transfer for Machine Translation between German and English, in
particular:

- the semantic repraesentation, disambiguation and translation of
  temporal expressions

- the semantic repraesentation, disambiguation and translation of
  complex words

- the computational modelling of these empirical domains, and

- and the implementation of a working subsystem of VERBMOBIL in
  collaboration with other VERBMOBIL sites.

Candidates should have experience in computational linguistics
(particularly in unification-based formalisms) or computer science.
Knowledge of German and experience in Machine Traslation,
NL-Syntax/Semantics (particularly in Head-Driven Phrase Structure
Grammar, Discourse Representation Theory and in the semantics of tense
and aspect), Logic, or Prolog-Programming is highly desirable.  The
successful candidate will be expected to work both on theoretical
issues and practical implementation.

The project started in 1993 and will last until December 1996, with
the possibility of extension depending on funding.  The successful
candidate would be expected to take up the position as soon as
possible.  The position is at the rank of "Wissenschaftlicher
Mitarbeiter" (salary on the German payscale of BAT IIa; minimum of
65 000 DM per year).

Applications should include CV and an outline of research experience
and interests.  Names and addresses of references would be helpful.

Organization: SOAS


          Signal Analysis /Pattern Recognition Specialist
                    Programmer, Systems Designer

     The HAL Trust is a research and development project
     funded to implement a speech recognition system that
     incorporates a cognitive-based-phonological strategy.
     The project has implemented the cognitive strategy and
     produced encouraging results.  The approach seems to
     yield a highly efficient and effective back end to a
     recognition system.

     We are currently seeking to obtain greater expertise
     in the fields of signal processing, programming and
     computational science.  We anticipate hiring at least
     one full-time researcher-developer.  The near term
     objective is to expand and complete the development of
     a full pilot system.  To accomplish this we seek the
     expertise required for the development of traditional
     front ends to recognition systems, such as knowledge
     of (acoustic) signal processing techniques.  In
     particular we seek a strong creative ability to tailor
     front-end development to the pattern requirements of
     the cognitive-based strategies.  We are open to
     exploration of traditional methodologies such as
     hidden Markov models but would also value ideas on
     alternative approaches.  Programming skills and
     computational sophistication are highly desirable.

     We envision an intense research and development effort
     over the next 6-12 months.  The position would provide
     the opportunity to make a significant research
     contribution to the overall design of the system.  In
     addition, the objective of the project is to develop
     a commercial product.  The trust has significant
     managerial expertise involved in the project.  This
     creates an opportunity for growth and long term
     involvement for a suitably qualified individual.

     At present the project is based at the University of
     London.  The position is for an initial period of 6-12
     months at the University facilities with the potential
     for a longer term commitment at the end of one year.
     The position is available immediately.  Salary is
     commensurate with expertise and the cost of living in
     London.  For further information please contact:

RADSS  Technologies is a new company with experience developing  
artificial intelligence solutions for difficult transportation and  
optimization problems.  With this background and a proven track record,  
we intend to be the software supplier of choice for transportation  
companies.  Our success with our first product - a railcar allocation  
optimization model - has created the need to add a new member to our  
team in Calgary.

With a post-graduate degree in computing that has given you a good  
appreciation of optimization problems - and artificial intelligence  
approaches to solving them -  you are interested in getting in on the  
ground floor of an innovative software company. Your academic foundation  
has been augmented by your industrial track record, ambition,  
independence, and your desire to be on the leading edge.  In addition,  
you like working in teams, and have no qualms about wearing different  
hats as the need arises.

Product manager

As a product manager working with an existing optimization product, you  
will be measured on how well you service the needs of your  
clients.  You will develop the product to meet (but usually anticipate)  
the needs of your stakeholders, and you will put in mechanisms to build  
a strong user community.  You will be on top of research in the field  
to help you direct the products evolution.  In addition, you will  
assist marketing by providing demonstrations and presentations of the  
product to a wide audience.

You have experience in ORACLE database development (including Pro-C,  
Forms 3 and 4.x), C, C++, customer support, AIX, and X emulation  
software.  When the client base grows, you will be expected to undertake  
recruitment and leadership roles to fit the needs of this unit.  You are  
comfortable managing a budget and being measured on results, and have an  
exceptional ability to communicate and listen.

If you are interested, and can work in Canada, please send a resume to

RADSS Technologies
505 - 2nd Street S.W.
Calgary, CANADA

or email to radss@awp.com

We would like to thank all applicants in advance, and will be contacting  
short-list candidates only.

Incorporated in 1984, Carnegie Group, Inc. is an advanced software systems
integrator focusing on applying knowledge-based technologies within a client-
server architecture.

The company was founded by four widely respected computer scientists from
Carnegie Mellon University, to apply knowledge-based technology in the
commercial arena.


Carnegie Group's systems enable clients to automate critical, re-engineered
business processes within their organizations to improve productivity ,
product quality, customer service -- and ultimately, the bottom line.
Because they process not only numerical data but information and know-how as
well, these systems are especially well-suited to problems that are now solved
manually (if at all) but that require scarce or expensive knowledge, skills
and expertise.

Carnegie Group currently has two openings for a GUI engineer on our
TRAC2ES team.  TRAC2ES is a decision support system for mass casualty
evacuation from natural disasters and military arenas.  This revolutionary
system will be built with user-interactive and GUI technologies, linked to
worldwide transportation/medical data networks and quickly deployable in
emergency situations.

We offer the ideal professional setting for the innovative engineer who is
seeking a career in a world-class development environment.  As a member of
our team, you'll enjoy a competitive compensation package, relocation
assistance and significant opportunities for growth.  Interested?

               Member of Technical Staff
                  POSITION  AVAILABLE

MCC is one of the nation's leading technology development and 
commercialization consortia.  Its mission is to strengthen and 
sustain the competitiveness of its nearly 100 member organizations 
and customers that share common technical and product requirements 
in electronics and information technology.  MCC conducts a wide 
range of activities intended to accelerate the development and 
commercialization of advanced technology in the areas of advanced 
electronic systems, information management, intelligent systems, 
and distributed systems management.

The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) is 
a research and development consortium serving the electronics and 
computer industries. Our focus is information technologies and 
advanced electronics. With a membership and customer base of 
nearly 100 corporations, public and non-profit agencies, and 
universities, MCC provides a forum where industry, government 
and academia can collaborate, leveraging investments - and 
expertise - in the development of high-risk, high-impact technology 
while reducing costly duplication of efforts. This collaborative 
environment provides an opportunity to cooperate on projects that 
are inherently multi-company or multi-industry. 

The specific opportunity available is described below:

             InfoSleuth:  Networked Exploitation 
             of Information using Semantic Agents
                 Member of Technical Staff 

PROJECT SUMMARY 

InfoSleuth is developing and deploying new technologies for
finding information in both corporate and external networks, 
such as those based on the emerging National Information 
Infrastructure (NII).  The InfoSleuth research is based on 
MCC's acclaimed Carnot technology, developed in a collaborative 
project over the last 4 years.  Carnot has been successfully 
used to integrate heterogeneous corporate information
resources.  The InfoSleuth Project will investigate the use 
of Carnot technology in a more dynamically changing environment, 
such as the Internet, where new information sources are 
constantly being added and for which there is no formal control 
of the registration of new information sources.  In this type 
of environment, traditional techniques for expressing and optimizing 
database queries are inadequate because of the rapidly changing 
schema information and the fuzzy nature of the queries. InfoSleuth 
will build on Carnot's semantic modeling capabilities to enable 
"deep" descriptions of available information sources, and 
InfoSleuth will deploy intelligent agents to carry out distributed, 
coordinated, self-adapting search algorithms.

More information on Carnot and InfoSleuth can be found on the 
World Wide Web at:
   http://www.mcc.com/projects/carnot
   http://www.mcc.com/projects/infosleuth

THE OPPORTUNITY

To participate in challenging research aimed at constructing 
practical solutions for finding, accessing, browsing, investigating, 
and updating information residing in a distributed system of 
structured (data bases) and unstructured (text documents) 
information sources. The specific problems are: integration of 
DBs based on semantic domain models, data mining, document retrieval 
and extraction of information from text. The work is conducted in 
the form of application partnerships with organizations funding 
the project. This collaboration grounds the research in real 
problems encountered at large companies and institutions.

The position involves programming in various languages (some of 
them non-orthodox) and working on systems (design and implementation) 
consisting of many different components of two types: commercially 
available ones and those developed within the framework of the project.

QUALIFICATIONS

Excellent programming skills (on the designing and coding levels), 
a passion towards programming, and the tendency to view work more 
as a source of pleasure and happiness than as a routine duty are 
the most valuable qualifications expected.  Specific languages 
include, but are not limited to:
                                 - C++
                                 - Tcl/Tk
                                 - Lisp

Require knowledge and experience in more than one of the 
following areas:
         - modeling of information and knowledge representation
         - databases
         - natural language processing
         - developing graphical interfaces

Master's in Computer Science or Computer Engineering required.

Fast growing start-up company near LAX is adding  a key person to its
development staff.  This person will have responsibility for  the on-going
design and development of the text analysis portion of a document
processing system.  The work will be done in both C Language and PERL and
will run in a Unix environment.  Our technical approach stresses the use of
document structure and features to aid in text analysis, thereby minimizing
the need for full natural language understanding.    If you have worked in
this area, and believe that a pattern matching approach can be a pragmatic
method of extracting information from predictably formed text documents, we
have a great opportunity for you!

The company is creating a system to analyze documents and extract
information.  The information is made available through either a local or a
WWW browser.  In addition to our text analysis work, we are pushing on
technology boundaries in the areas of object-relational multi-media
databases, multi- engine voting OCR systems, and Web publishing.  Are you
interested in this type of work in a dynamic, young company? If so, and if
your background qualifies you, send, fax, or e-mail your resume to me, Dot
Ringer, so we can start a discussion.

Candidates must be immediately available and in the Los Angeles area
(sorry, we cannot relocate).

case-based reasoning, model-based approaches to diagnostic
reasoning and methodologies for knowledge engineering.

Other leading members of the group include Professor Tom Addis,
who also has over 20 years involvement in the field and is a
former chairman of the Artificial Intelligence Professional Group
of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He is currently
conducting research into graphical programming interfaces and
into theoretical aspects of the representation and use of
knowledge.

Fellows will normally need to have a PhD degree as well as a
track record of successful published research in either Machine
Learning or Knowledge Based Systems. They will be expected to
have an active area of ongoing research which fits closely with
the Department's current interests. In addition they will be
expected to contribute to the overall development of the
Department's research culture. Specifically, they will:

  - Undertake and publish research in their chosen subject area

  - Maintain expertise in their discipline and disseminate it to
    others


  - Support and facilitate the research of other members of the AI
    Research Group

  - Contribute to the Department's PhD training program for its AI

Description: Two-year position working on natural language processing
within the Soar project.  Our main focus will be to extend the current
models of comprehension and generation (NL-Soar) within the context of
military simulations.  In particular, the current system is oriented
toward real-time dialog behavior between intelligent agents (e.g.
pilot, wing, air controller) participating in simulated engagements in
the tactical air domain. Although this work will continue under the
current position, we will also be responsible for providing a
real-time, incremental language capability between these agents and
command level agents also built within the Soar framework.

The natural language project consists of 1 faculty member, 3 graduate
students and a post-doc. In addition to the applications mentioned above,
current research using NL-Soar includes issues in language acquisition,
speech recognition, and simultaneous translation. The language project
exists within a larger Soar community (about 15 members at CMU, about 100
active researchers throughout the world). A person filling this position is
expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation
of the system, as well as contribute to the intellectual life of the community.

Qualifications: Applicants should have a B.S.,  M.S. or  Ph.D. in computer
science or computational linguistics. THIS IS A SYSTEM-BUILDING POSTDOC, so a
very strong background in building systems is required.  Experience in both
language generation and comprehension is preferred. Basic knowledge of
machine learning techniques helpful. APPLICANT MUST BE ABLE TO START WORK
BY SEPTEMBER 1.

To apply: send a resume and names of three references to physical or
e-mail address above. Please have recommendations letters specifically
address the system building strengths and weaknesses of the applicant.

==============================================================================
Systems Analyst Position: AI applications to Education in Lisp
Coaching, Explanation, etc. in Networked Computer-based Learning Environment
LRDC, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position Description:

"Systems Analyst II", full time, 2 year position (assuming adequate
performance during 6 month provisional period) with possible renewal
contingent on funding.  ARPA funded project: "Collaboration, Apprenticeship,
and Critical Discussion: Groupware for Learning," Alan Lesgold, Sandy Katz,
Dan Suthers, and Arlene Weiner principal investigators.  Supervisor: Dan
Suthers. Start in September or October 1995.

The successful candidate will design, implement, and test various applications
of Artificial Intelligence techniques to education, including automated
coaches, problem solvers, explanation facilities, tutoring strategies, and
user modeling techniques. Work will most likely involve writing Common LISP
applications in a Unix environment. The functionality provided by these
applications will be made available by a server to client interfaces
implemented by other programmers on Mac or PC platforms. Hence interaction
with external programs and careful attention to memory management will be
required. Some implementation of AI functionality in other languages suitable
for client platforms may be required in cases where server-based functionality
is infeasible (e.g., for simulation engines which control real-time displays).
Ability to work well with other programmers who will be implementing the
server and user interfaces is essential.  Flexibility and quick response are
requisites, since this project is committed to revision and redesign as
needed, and to producing quick prototypes and usable systems in a relatively
short time.  Robustness of software will be achieved by group design
discussions, empirical testing, and scrutiny and possible revision of code by
others. Lone hackers need not apply.

Minimum Knowledge/Education: M.S. in Computer Science or equivalent
experience.

Minimum Experience Level: Prior experience with Common LISP and Artificial
Intelligence techniques is essential.  Successful participation in a
substantial multi-programmer software project.

Preferred Additional Experience: Prior experience in developing Intelligent
Tutoring Systems. Background in cognitive science, education, or the
psychology of learning.  Experience with CGI and/or client/server
communications.

Salary Range for Systems Analyst II: minimum 25,320, "control point" (beyond
which significant justification is required) 35,460. Excellent benefits.

We are also hiring for two other Systems Analyst positions. We reserve the
right to reallocate assignments and rewrite job descriptions to fit successful
candidates' qualifications and experience. Hence, if your background does not
match this description exactly but you have other experience that may be
relevant, you should read the other job postings.  If there is a match,
indicate in your application that your experience is relevant to a mixture of
the positions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Duties, responsibilities, performance standards, and percentages of time:

 PLANNING: 20%
 Meet with project members to design the software and coordinate work with
other aspects of the project.
 Related Performance Standard: Ability to interact well with project members
from diverse backgrounds, including computer scientists, educators, and
psychologists, to evaluate needs, design systems, coordinate implementation,
and coordinate installation of the software in school sites.  Sufficient
understanding of software design techniques and project goals to contribute to
planning and design.

 PROGRAMMING: 50%
 See "Position Description."
 Related Performance Standard: Proficiency in Common Lisp and familiarity with
Artificial Intelligence techniques.  Use of modular, object oriented design
techniques.  Use of a code version control tool.  Be able to manage one's own
software development activities such that prototype modules and subsequent
improvements are available when they are needed for testing by other project
members.  Prioritize tasks and identify and discuss potential problems before
they impact on delivery deadlines.

 TESTING: 20%
 Thorough testing of implemented functionality under a variety of scenarios.
 Related Performance Standard: Ability to maintain test suites and conduct
tests in a systematic manner.

 DOCUMENTATION AND WRITING: 10%
 Code must be well documented. May be asked to write short reports on the
status, design, implementation, and testing of code.
 Related Performance Standard: Programming habits that include documentation
during the development process. Basic familiarity with word processing
software and willingness to learn new word processor. Ability to write clear,
concise documentation.

About LRDC:

Since its founding in 1963, the Learning Research and Development Center
(LRDC) at the University of Pittsburgh has emerged as the leading research
institution for cognitive science and technology applied to education.  LRDC
faculty serve on numerous national advisory bodies, edit a number of scholarly
journals, and have served as officers of the leading scholarly associations in
their fields.  LRDC researchers helped introduce such ideas as individualized
instruction; criterion-referenced testing; using technology to enhance,
individualize and manage learning; and the student as an active learner who
constructs his or her own knowledge much as a scientist constructs socially
shared knowledge.  Today, LRDC researchers are leaders in many areas of
research and development, including basic processes of learning, learning in
the workplace, subject matter learning in school, and the improvement of
schooling.  Approximately $11 million worth of sponsored research projects are
managed by LRDC.

The Center has its own building, a nine-story facility.  The building is fully
networked with local Ethernet interconnected to the University backbone, which
is connected to the Internet with T3 bandwidth.  LRDC houses more than a dozen
high-end workstations and more than 200 personal computer systems.  In
addition to the shared University-wide file service (AFS), LRDC maintains four
very large Novell file servers on its premises, along with about a dozen
high-speed network printers.  Within the Center's building, sound and video
studio facilities permit authoring and editing of multimedia presentations,
including mastering of CD-ROM disks.

                      UNIVERSITY OF SALFORD
                     Department of Surveying

          Chairman of Department: Professor P S Barrett

APPOINTMENT OF LECTURER IN CONSTRUCTION IT

A Construction IT professional, with energy and enthusiasm for
education and research, is required to join the team of lecturers
in the Surveying Department.

A strong construction background with some practical experience
would be ideal and familiarity with one or more of the following
is sought, STEP and other classification systems, expert systems, case-based rea
soning, neural networks, Virtual Reality, applications software such as AutoCADor Superproject.

Applicants should preferably possess a good Honours degree in an
appropriate discipline and will probably have a postgraduate
qualification. Evidence of research experience and a publication
track record is sought.


The Post

The successful applicant will be expected to contribute to
undergraduate and postgraduate teaching in IT in Construction and
to join a multi-disciplinary research group. Teaching duties will
be geared, as far as possible, to the successful candidate's own
particular specialisms and most courses within the Department
have a large IT element.

Beyond teaching, a range of skills is required to encompass
research and publication and postgraduate supervision, as the
Department has large numbers of full-time and part-time research
postgraduates many of whom have an IT focus.


The Department

The Department of Surveying was established in August 1990 having
previously been a division within the Department of Civil
Engineering.  In August 1991 the Department expanded to
accommodate the Construction Management Unit.

The Chairman of the Department is Professor P S Barrett.
There are 2 other Professors
                    -    Professor P S Brandon
                    -    Professor G Brown
and 19 full time Academics.

There are  4 undergraduate courses in the Department:

     a)   BSc(Hons) in Building Surveying

     b)   BSc(Hons) in Construction Management (fully sponsored
          course)

     c)   BSc(Hons) in Quantity Surveying

     d)   BSc(Hons) in Property Development & Asset Management


and in addition there are two specialist Construction IT
postgraduate courses

     (i)  MSc in IT for Property and Construction - mainly full
     time for individual students

     (ii) MSc in Construction IT (IGDS) - mainly part time for
     company sponsorship.


The Department is situated in the newly refurbished Bridgewater
Building which is on the Meadow Road complex adjacent to the
River Irwell and separated from the main campus by a 5 minute
walk through the park.

The Department has well developed links with industry which
provides input to the undergraduate courses and the research
activity currently undertaken.  It presently works with over
eighty firms.

The University merges with University College Salford, which is
on an adjacent campus, on 1st August 1996.  The Department of
Construction and Surveying at the College offer only part-time
degree courses and following merger the Department of Surveying
will offer its four existing full time undergraduate courses plus
the part-time courses currently offered by the College.


Undergraduate Courses

The Quantity and Building Surveying courses were validated for
a further 7 years in 1993 by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors and afford graduates full exemption from the
Institution's examinations.  The Department holds RICS Accredited
Centre status.  The Construction Management course is recognised
by the Chartered Institute of Building for exemption purposes.

All courses in the Department became modularised in October 1993
and in common with the rest of the University follow a pattern
of 2 semesters which currently fit into the 3 term pattern still
followed by year 4 of the old schemes.  Modularised Surveying
courses can be either a full time 3 year or 4 year integrated
sandwich course whilst the Construction Management Course is a
4 year 'thin' sandwich course with 6 months of each of the first
three years spent with the sponsoring contractor.  The Property
Development course is a 3 year full time course and gains
exemption from the general practice professional examinations of
the RICS.


Postgraduate Courses and Programmes

In 1990 an MPhil programme for building surveyors was launched
supported by 28 firms and this programme takes around 15
graduates per year mainly on a part time basis the success of
this has led to similar MPhil programmes for Construction
Management and Quantity Surveying.  In the same year the
University launched a fully self-funded Master's Degree Course
in Information Technology for Property and Construction with a
substantial grant from Unisys.  This course provides exemption
from Part 1 of the British Computer Society examination.

The number of full time postgraduate students has grown
considerably in recent years and there are presently well over
100 postgraduates working in the Department including Research
Fellows, Research Assistants, Research Students and students on
the taught Postgraduate courses.  In October 1995 the new IGDS
(Integrated Graduate Development Scheme) in Construction IT takes
its first delegates onto its part-time modular masters programme.


International Activities

International activities are wide and varied and many countries
are requesting assistance from, or collaboration with, the
Department, particularly in the areas covered by the Department's
work in Construction IT.  It has one of the strongest research
and postgraduate groups in the world in this area of academic
expertise.

The Department has featured significantly in the technical press
and is represented strongly on regional national and
international committees.


Departmental Research Activities

The Department was awarded a 5A research rating in the 1992 UFC
Research Selectivity Exercise the highest possible rating,
indicating a world class research programme.

A recent development has been the formation of the National
Centre of Excellence for Construction IT which is a government
authorised implementation body for national strategy based in the
Department. It is a collaborative venture between Industry &
Research Institutions to develop a research work plan for the UK
Construction Industry.

Over the past 3 years the Department has received research grants
from a variety of bodies such as EPSRC, DTI, DoE,  European
Commission and others.  Its research has been particulary strong
in the area of Property and Construction Information Technology
but there are other research strengths in Facilities Management,
Building Management and Economics European Occupational Health
& Safety Law, Materials Science and Management of Construction
Organisations.

The University has formed 6 Research Institutes under the
leadership of Professor Peter Brandon, the former Chairman of
this Department, who has been appointed to the position of Pro-Vice-Chancellor (
Research).  These cross former Departmental
boundaries and the TIME (Technology, Information Management and
Economics) Research Institute is the one in which most members
of this Department belong within the Research Centre for the
Built and Human Environment. Associate membership of any of the
other Research Institutes is encouraged. The Construction IT
group has existing strengths in Virtual Reality, Case based
reasoning, Knowledge based expert systems, Integration, IT
Management and Process Modelling.  An applicant with interests
in these or other related areas would be particularly welcome.

Unreasonable Ambitions?

Easily satisfied visions have no place at Hewlett-Packard's Corporate Research
Centre in Bristol, UK . Here, more than two hundred researchers from all
over Europe (and beyond) work together to achieve research goals which
will lead to new products for the company in three to five years time.

The Model Based Systems Department is one research group within this
organisation. We are currently looking for a number of new people to help us
shape the future of personal computation and communication. Mobile
communications technology combined with portable computation provides a rich
environment for supportingc distributed teamwork. As a department we aim to
provide software support to give such teams the functionality they need.

The MBSD contains projects working on advanced services for specific domains
(healthcare and financial), and is forming projects which will focus on
developing appropriate technologies to be used across domains. One of these
will focus on the technologies required to support the computational
requirements of advanced services.

Our goal is to support the work of teams of professionals by providing
easy and effective access to personalised communication and computation.
Since we believe that in general people will still want to use a variety
of types of terminal (from pagers to PCs), we aim to ensure that users no
longer view their devices (phone, laptop, pc, etc.) as separate, but
instead as different access tools on a single workspace. Both unstructured
and structured data will be communicated, and structured data will be
manipulated by applications within the user's personal workspace. We believe
that agent technologies may have an important contribution to make to the
fulfilment of this vision.

We aim to combine development of short-term solutions to
problems with a longer-term research programme, looking at the issues which
arise from the work. We anticipate that Agent based programming will provide
some insights into these issues. In particular, the concept of an "agent as
proxy", acting on behalf of an individual who is "away", will be very
important.


Job Description

We are looking for a software architect - a graduate with
several years experience of prototype development in a high level programming
language. This person will take responsibility for the design and
implementation of a series of prototype services and applications in
different domains. Experience with Smalltalk would be preferred, although
enthusiasm for the project and willingness to learn a new language is also
acceptable.

In return for your commitment and creativity we offer the opportunity to work
with some of the best technical people in multi-disciplinary teams. You will
have access to excellent resources, and will be a part of an extremely
successful and diverse multi-national company, with all the attendant
opportunities for personal growth and development. Our salary and benefits
package will meet the expectations of the highest calibre people.

Subject: NASA Ames S/W Engineer for Automatic Programming Project
Organization: NASA/Ames Information Sciences
Date: Wed, 9 Aug 1995 03:20:52 GMT


Background:

The goal of the Amphion project is to make knowledge-based software
enginnering (KBSE) a reality for NASA. KBSE uses techniques from
artificial intelligence and formal methods to raise the level at which
users program to the specification level (what is the problem to be
solved) rather than the detailed code level (how to solve a problem). 
Programs are generated automatically from specifications.

The Amphion system is a general-purpose KBSE system that has been
applied to several NASA domains: space science observation geometries
(Amphion/NAIF), space shuttle navigation (Amphion/TOT), and
computational fluid dynamics (Amphion/CFD). The most mature of these
applications - Amphion/NAIF - has generated software currently in
use by space scientists. One example is a visualizer for the 1995/1996 
Saturn Ring crossing, when Saturn's rings appear edge-on to the earth,
thus providing unique observation opportunities. 

More information can be found on the WWW at 
       http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/amphion/index.html

We are currently expanding Amphion from a research system to a robust
industrial-quality system that will be distributed to various NASA 
user communities.

Job Description and Requirements:

We are seeking an experienced software engineer who has had
significant system-building and customer support responsibilities on 
software projects. The major job responsibilities will be to continue
development and refinement of the user interfaces; system building,
robustifying, and maintenance; and working directly with
customers. In the next year customers will mostly be space
scientists and engineers working on unmanned missions such as 
Galileo (Jupiter), Cassini (Saturn), and Mars Surveyor, and New
Millennium. Secondary responsibilities will be to support and 
participate in research aimed at next-generation KBSE systems.

The base qualification for this job is previous project experience 
building and maintaining UNIX-based software systems, and subsequent
customer support. Experience with Lisp and X-Windows is a plus.
Good candidates should be well organized, highly motivated, and able
to learn quickly. This job offers significant technical growth.
The following is a partial list of sciences and technologies that are 
relevant to this job; we expect most of these to be learned on the job
(please mention previous training or experience):

Solar System Astronomy, celestial mechanics, automated theorem proving,
knowledge representation and acquisition, formal specification languages,
Lisp, CLOS (common lisp object system), user interface technologies 
including Garnet, Motif, HTML (Word Wide Web) and X-WIndows, 
and application languages including Fortran and C++.

Salary will be commensurate with experience and education.
This is a full-time permanent position, available immediately.
US citizenship or green card status is required. The bulk of 
the work will be performed on site at NASA Ames Research Center
in Silicon Valley (the south San Francisco bay area).

To apply:

Please send an electronic copy of a cover-letter and resume
or curriculum vitae (ASCII or Postscript) to

        lowry@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov

If you are unable to send email, a hardcopy of your resume can be 
mailed to:

Dr. Michael Lowry
MS 269-2
NASA Ames Research Center
Moffett Field, CA 94035

Preliminary interviews will be held either by telephone, in the
Silicon Valley area, or at IJCAI'95.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER
Windows Developer
 
Wonderware is the leading supplier of industrial automation
software for use within manufacturing environments.  Our man-
machine interface (MMI) products run on IBM PC and compatible
computers in industrial and process automation applications.
 
Our Rubicon Technology Division currently comprises only three
people, but is poised for substantial growth due to the extreme
success of our product InSupport and its massive future potential.
 
This presents a "being in the right place at the right time, best
of both worlds" opportunity, in that you will be working in a
closely-knit, extremely entrepreneurial, non-bureaucratic environ-
ment, but with the backing and support of one of the fastest
growing software companies in the country.
 
Working closely with the original developers of the product, you
will "jump right in" on the development of a major rewrite of
InSupport.  InSupport is a Windows based diagnostics and
documentation tool, used for supporting industrial processes and
equipment.
 
On a day-to-day basis, you will work in C++ with MFC, to develop an
embeddable, easily extensible, portable expert systems engine that
access a relational database.  You will also create tools that
allow development end users to embed their existing documents in
our product or vice versa.  The overall strategy is to move in the
direction of general connectivity from our system to a host of
multimedia authoring tools.
 
To be considered for this position, you will need to have: at least
3 years of C++ and Windows based software development background;
experience in all aspects of development including designing the
architecture, user interfaces, document formats, etc.; and good
oral and written communication skills.

The salary range is variable, from $45K to $100K depending on

questions about the department, the job, what it's like to work
for a bank (for instance, we don't wear suits) and most of all
we would like to see resumes (including salary requirements) from
interested parties.

                            Euro-PUNCH Project

                 Research Assistant Position for One Year

Under the terms of a grant recently awarded to the Euro-PUNCH Project we
expect to offer a one year's Research Assistant position in Cambridge to
investigate the use of:

          Neural Networks in the Prediction of Risk in Pregnancy

Euro-PUNCH is a collaborative Project funded by the Human Capital and
Mobility Programme of the Commission of the European Communities.  Thus,
the post is available only to a citizen of a European Union Member State
(but not British), who wishes to come to work in the United Kingdom.

From the obstetrical point of view, the principal focus of the Euro-PUNCH
Project lies in the use of patient-specific measurements of an
epidemiological nature (such as maternal age, past obstetrical history,
etc.) as well as fetal heart rate recordings, in the forecasting of a
number of specific Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes.

From the neural network point of view, the Project involves the design of
pattern-processing and classification systems which can be trained to
forecast problems in pregnancy.  This will involve continuation of work on
pattern-classification and regression analysis, using neural networks
operating on a very large database of about 1.2 million pregnancies from
various European countries.  Challenging components of the project include
dealing with missing and uncertain variables, sensitivity analysis,
variable selection procedures and cluster analysis.

Many leading European obstetrical centres are involved in the Euro-PUNCH
project, and close collaboration with a number of these will be an
essential component of the post offered.

Candidates for this post are expected to have a good first degree and
preferably a post-graduate degree in a relevant discipline.  Come
familiarity with medical statistics and neural networks is desirable but
not essential.

Salary (on the RA scale) will depend on age and experience, and is likely
to be in the range of #14,317 to #15,986 per annum.  Appointment would be
subject to satisfactory health screening.

Applications will close on 23rd August 1995.

Interviews will be held in Cambridge and are likely to be on Wednesday 30th
August 1995.

Applications (naming two referees) should be submitted to:

	  Dr Kevin J Dalton PhD FRCOG
	  Division of Materno-Fetal Medicine, Dept. Obstetrics & Gynaecology
	  University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital
	  Cambridge  CB2 2QQ

	Research Positions in Multi-Lingual Information Retrieval
		at the Rank Xerox Research Centre

The Multi-Lingual Theory and Technology group at the Rank Xerox
Research Centre (located in Grenoble, France) is looking for motivated
researchers to work on problems in information retrieval and natural
language processing. Two positions are available.

			Research Associate

The candidate will provide technical support for our work in
multi-lingual information retrieval and contribute to the development
of an information retrieval system suited to our research needs.
Secondary work will involve other aspects of natural language
processing, as our interests range from automatic translation to text
generation to information retrieval in a multi-lingual setting. There
are a number of active projects that range in scope from long term
basic research to short term prototyping.

Applicants should have the equivalent of at least a U.S. master's
degree in computer science. A degree in a closely related field may
also be acceptable if they have a strong computational
background. Candidates must have excellent skills and considerable
experience with Unix and C/C++ programming. Some experience with both
corpus linguistics and large scale information retrieval problems
would be highly desirable. The applicant must be able to communicate
effectively in English and knowledge of other major European languages
would also be helpful.  There is no specific deadline for application,
but we expect the position to be filled early in 1996 at the latest.

			Research Scientist

The candidate will collaborate in the development of new approaches to
solving multi-lingual information retrieval problems and will also
contribute to our ongoing work to develop statistical and linguistic
tools for analyzing text in English, French, German, and other major
European languages. In particular, (s)he will collaborate with other
researchers at RXRC on projects involving the automatic extraction and
translation of terminology from multi-lingual text collections.

Applicants should have the equivalent of a PhD in computer science or
some closely related field and have practical experience with
information retrieval and a strong computational background. The ideal
background would include some experience with computational
linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, and/or the
statistical analysis of text. Experience with large scale information
retrieval problems is also desirable. Candidates will be expected to
develop new ideas and work on long term basic research, so creativity
and strong personal motivation are essential qualities. The applicant
must be able to communicate effectively in English, and working
knowledge of French, German, or other major European languages would be
valuable. The position will be available in mid-1996.

Applications should be sent to:

designer.  For sure, you're always reaching for those moments of insight and flat-out 
brilliance.  Windows and mice?  Some days you itch for more:  intelligent systems 
that can get what you want, when you want it, as if they had real understanding.

wide-open mind.  Because we're new, you'll have a voice in shaping a corporate 
culture for the century ahead.  Bring us your ideas. 

We're Televitesse -- a Newbridge affiliate, born to change the way people use Mass 
Media.  Televitesse Systems develops intelligent multimedia solutions that put 
people first.  Right now, we're launching a media revolution called accesTV.  It's a 
personal assistant that actually watches TV for you,  attending every word to zero in 
on subjects you care about.  accesTV will be huge with a world-wide market of 
Cable Companies, Telcos,  Broadcasters and people in the financial industry.  One 
day soon,  everyone will want it.  Televitesse Systems is backed by Newbridge 
Networks Corporation, a world leader in multimedia communications.  We're 
destined to grow.  Fast.

of transcripts in confidence to Human Resources at Televitesse Systems Inc.  603 
March Road, Kanata,  Ontario K2K 2M5  by Nov. 1st 1995. 

Only those candidates selected for an interview will be contacted.

                  Intuitive Interfaces to Information 
              Systems Project--The Role of Human Language

Information systems now occupy a position of central importance 
in our economy, and successful business competition depends 
critically on effective and efficient processing of information.  
The importance of information processing and of the development of a 
National Information Infrastructure (NII) is acknowledged throughout 
industry, and the importance of a strong NII to the nation's 
well-being is recognized and strongly supported at top levels of 
government.  But, in order to provide full benefit from and full 
access to these information services, significant advances are needed 
in ease-of-use.  Natural and intuitive interfaces are required to 
empower the user, to exploit the potential of information services, 
and to bring information access to everybody.

Human language is clearly the medium and human language technology 
is the key to fulfill this need.  A host of potential application 
areas require human language interfaces.  Generic examples include 
information retrieval based upon natural language queries, machine 
translation of text from one language to another, automatic 
extraction of information from text for creating databases, 
dictation of text by voice, and domain-specific spoken language 
understanding for natural interactions with information systems.  
These applications represent a wave of potential services that will 
be enabled by natural intuitive interfaces using human language 
technology.  The I3S study was created to support and foster this 
vital development.

*************************************************************
The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation

Information technology is advancing at break-neck speeds.
Competition is going global. Business success demands innovation,
agility, and the right strategic partners working together to
get further faster and at less expense.

It was this philosophy-the value of cooperation-that led ten
major U.S. corporations to launch MCC more than a decade ago,
and it continues to be MCC's guiding philosophy today. Shrinking
margins and limited resources make consortial research more
valuable today than ever before, providing a proven strategy for
accelerating technology development and leveraging scarce R&D
resources.

Today's MCC is a rich environment for multidisciplinary
research and development, technology integration, and
alliance-building, with a pervasive commitment to accelerating
the creation, commercialization, and adoption of innovation in
information technologies and advanced electronics. MCC's objective
is to enhance the ability of member companies to harness the
power of information technology to attain sustainable competitive
advantage.

Founded by major computer and semiconductor manufacturers, MCC's
membership has diversified to include a broad range of high-profile
corporations from electronics, computers, aerospace, semiconductors,
and related industries, as well as major end users of advanced
technology. MCC's membership reflects the full range of companies
that are vital to the life cycle of information technology and
advanced electronic products. Active involvement of small- and medium-
sized manufacturers, along with well-established alliances with
government research and development agencies and leading universities,
allows MCC's partners to make cost-effective use of R&D resources.

Assessment Exercise.  In 1997 the Department will move into a spacious
new building, accompanied by a significant
expansion of its teaching and research activities.


The Department has a small but growing research group in Intelligent
Systems.  The aim of the group is to investigate the theoretical
principles of artificial intelligence and their application to
real-world domains.  Research topics covered by the group include:
knowledge representation and reasoning, especially automated
deduction; constraint logic programming and constraint solving;
machine learning, especially case-based reasoning, learning to plan,
learning grammars for natural languages; generalisation and
computational learning theory; natural language processing.  The
Department expects the successful candidate to be able to make a
significant contribution to this research group or a related area.  A
proven record in research is essential.  Proven ability in university
teaching will be an additional recommendation.

                      EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS



General
-------
In the Institute for Perception Research (IPO), Philips Research and
the Eindhoven University of Technology have a close collaboration. The
essence of the research programme is: how do humans assess information,
especially in interaction with hardware and software. The study of this
topic has a fundamental as well as an applied component. As a
consequence of the involvement of humans with technology, the study has
a strong interdisciplinary character. Actual themes include: perceptual
sound quality, language generation, speech synthesis, perceptual image
quality, interactive instruction, multimodal communication, information
ergonomics and communication resources.

IPO will participate in a European research project of which the
main objective is to integrate and further develop the enabling
technologies required for the design of speech operated human-machine
interfaces, for applications inside the automobile. Demonstrator
systems will be developed for the languages German and French, which
will be tested in the laboratory as well as in the car. IPO will 
participate in the project with two researchers, one for dialogue
management and one for spoken language generation. The first job
is planned for the full project period of 39 months, the second
job will start about 6 months after the start of the project and is
planned for 30 months. The project is expected to start in November
1995.

You may have noticed a slight change in the moderation of the
AI-related jobs mailing lists. Previously, all job postings had to go
through me, resulting in the posts arriving in spurts.

Last week I sent out the enclosed email message to everybody who had
submitted an approved job posting within the last year (more than 600
companies). From now on, I'm assuming that any company that submitted
a valid post in the past is responsible enough to submit only valid
posts in the future. The moderation program now transmits posts from
people on the approved list without requiring human intervention. The
mailing list will still kick out obviously misdirected subscription
requests from these people.

The net result is less work for me, and more timely job postings for you.

Mark Kantrowitz, moderator
mkant@cs.cmu.edu


Greetings,

Sometime during the past year, a job announcement, postdoc announcement, or
predoctoral studentship announcement relating to Artificial Intelligence,
Lisp, or Prolog was either posted by you to one of the following mailing
lists, or was forwarded by a third party to one of these mailing lists:

    AI-Jobs		ai+ai-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    Lisp-Jobs		ai+lisp-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    Prolog-Jobs		ai+prolog-jobs@cs.cmu.edu
    AI-Postdoc		ai+ai-postdoc@cs.cmu.edu
    AI-Predoc		ai+ai-predoc@cs.cmu.edu

The purpose of this email message is to provide you with information about
these mailing lists and the requirements for submitting an announcement to
one or more of these lists. My apologies if you receive multiple copies of
this message.

Best regards,

Mark Kantrowitz
mkant@cs.cmu.edu

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

These mailing lists are moderated. Announcements not meeting the following
requirements will be rejected:

   1. Material appropriate for these job mailing lists include AI, Lisp,
      and Prolog job announcements and AI predoctoral and postdoctoral
      fellowships. 

   2. All announcements must be of genuine positions. Resumes and
      discussion are not permitted. 

   3. The postings must be directly related to the purpose of the list. 
      For example, a C++ job announcement should not be sent to the AI-Jobs
      mailing list unless the position requires significant AI expertise.
      AI expertise must not be merely "desirable", but a specific job
      requirement.  

   4. Cross-posting between the various AI job lists is permitted, provided
      the post is clearly germaine to each list.

   5. Churning is not permitted. You may post the same job announcement
      no more than once a month. If there was a significant error in a 
      previous job announcement, you may repost a corrected copy. The
      post should indicate that it is a corrected copy near the top of
      the announcement and should summarize the corrected information.

   5. ** SUBJECT LINE FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS **

      The goal of the Subject line formatting requirements is to provide
      enough information in a single line to enable the mailing list
      subscribers to decide whether to read further. The subject line
      formatting requirements are as follows,

          Type: Description at Company (Location)

      where 

         -  Type is "Job", "Fellowship", "Postdoc", "Internship",
            "Lectureship", or something similar.

         -  Description is a short description of the job, such as a list
            of relevant AI fields (e.g., "NLP", "Robotics", etc.)

         -  Company is the name of the company offering the position.
            If you are a recruiter, please add "[Recruiter]" after
            the company name.

         -  Location is the location of the position. 

      For example, a Speech Recognition postdoctoral appointment at CMU
      would have the following subject line

        Postdoc: Speech Recognition at Carnegie Mellon Univ. (Pittsburgh, PA)

      and an expert systems position at Gensym might have the 
      following subject line

        Job: Real-Time Expert Systems, Lisp at Gensym (Cambridge, MA)


   6. Body formatting requirements:

      Please use a line-length of no more than 78 characters.

Countrywide Funding Corp, the nation's largest mortgage lender, is seeking
personnel for its AI department in Pasadena, California.

The primary responsibility will be to help develop data mining applications
to improve the efficiency and economy of mortgage origination. In the
last few years the mortgage banking industry has experienced a revolution in
the use of computer technology. It is now a fundamental component in remaining
competitive. Countrywide has been at the forefront of this trend. Its
award-winnning underwriting expert system CLUES underwrites 12,000 mortgage
applications a month. CLUES takes a couple of minutes to evaluate the risk of a
loan, including automatically ordering credit reports and property appraisals.
Countrywide's loan-servicing help desk fields 200,000 questions a month from
current borrowers. Several new projects are currently underway, each with the
potential to reduce costs for customers and improve profitability.

Both medium and senior positions are open. Candidates should have a Masters's
degree in computer science or a related field, a couple of years or more work
experience in AI and familiarity with knowledge induction tools, statistics,
databases and expert system shells. Candidates should be able to evaluate
and apply AI research to practical projects. A working appreciation of
standard software engineering principles is required.  Good communication
skills are essential, since some of the time is spent with non-technical
business people both in knowledge acquisition and project planning. Some
background in financial applications is desirable but not required.

Countrywide provides competitive salary and benefits, including medical,
dental, vision, life insurance; 401K (with the company providing matching
funds), stock options, retirement.

E-mail or fax resumes, plus a cover letter describing salary history and phone
number, to:

Cycorp is seeking enthusiastic, highly-motivated, multi-talented people
for positions in ontological engineering.  These positions involve
working with and extending the Cyc technology -- an immense, broad,
multi-contextual knowledge base which our group has developed over the
last eleven years.  Cyc already contains a useful selection of
fundamental human knowledge:  facts and heuristics for reasoning about
the objects and events of modern everyday life.  Cyc enables a multitude
of knowledge-intensive products and services which could revolutionize
the way in which people use and interact with computers, and Cycorp is
dedicated to making this happen.  Cyc currently supports ground-breaking
pilot applications in the areas of heterogeneous database browsing and
integration, captioned image retrieval, and natural language
undestanding.   We are looking for a few individuals to join us in this
challenging enterprise.


Those chosen as Ontological Engineers will:
-------------------------------------------
o have a facility with formal logic (predicate calculus)
o be self-motivated, yet work well in a team

Programming ability is a plus, but not required.  Familiarity with AI,
esp. knowledge representation, is also a plus, but not required.

For immediate consideration, send your resume and a cover letter to:

pressure, and the ability to adapt in the face of changing 
responsibilities.  We want you to make a significant contribution 
to our company, and you will have  the opportunity to grow and 
help define your own future.  If this sounds like you, then we 
want to meet you.  We offer competitive salary (commensurate with

Sender: ai@A.GP.CS.CMU.EDU

The Andes project at the Learning Research and Development Center,
University of Pittsburgh, seeks a full-time research programmer to
help develop a Bayesian reasoning system.  The Andes project is
developing an intelligent tutoring system that will teach college
physics.  The system will be used both as a testbed for evaluating
various instructional methods and as a means of improving instruction
in a 1200-student university physics class.  The research programmer
will be part of an 11-person team composed of physicists, computer
scientists and cognitive scientists.

The specific responsibilities of the programmer will be to develop a
student modeling system.  The system will induce and maintain a model
of the students' knowledge of physics given continuous data on the
student's performance.  The student modelling system will be written
in either C++, C or Java.  The system will employ techniques from
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for reasoning with uncertainty, notably
Bayesian belief networks.  Bayesian belief networks are probably the
fastest growing technology in AI.  We are willing to train a suitably
prepared candidate in this highly marketable skill.

The ideal candidate will have a BS in computer science or its
equivalent and significant experience in C++ or C programming.  A
background in statistics and/or AI are a definite plus.  The position
is funded from now until August 31, 1997.  There is a strong
possibility that funding will be extended for one or two years beyond
that date.  The compensation includes a competitive salary, full
benefits and reduced tuition for graduate and undergraduate courses at
the University of Pittsburgh.  If interested, please immediately
contact Kurt VanLehn via the following:
