SUMMARY: 

Leadership Roles

ExpLore Reasoning Systems (ERS) is a rapidly expanding software
consulting firm servicing clients in the mid-Atlantic region. We
build high-performance, distributed expert systems for
mission-critical applications. Current applications include
systems for:

. automated loan-processing 
. financial planning 
. automated differential diagnosis 
. program scheduling systems 

ERS, Inc. is an employee-centered company comprised of 
exceptionally skilled professionals who have created an
enlightened, productive environment in which to solve
interesting problems. ERS offers an outstanding salary structure
based upon hours worked, not hours "donated". We work with
clients who respect our skills, recommendations, and autonomy.

Sound like you share our ethos? Contact us!

ERS' offices are located in McLean, Virginia, near Washington,
DC. Client support is accomplished largely on-site.


BACKGROUND:

ExpLore Reasoning Systems provides complete solutions for
heterogeneous computing environments. We help our clients attain
a superior competitive position via selected process-automation
technologies. Our specialties include:

. CORBA- and I-net-based object-oriented architectures 
. rule-based implementations of dynamic policy 
. interaction with legacy databases

Strong relationships with blue-chip, financial sector clients
have led to a history of steady growth with continual openings
for self-directing professional staff. 

ERS's goal is to offer the best employment environment possible.
We emphasize:

. interesting work with regular exposure to different and 
  evolving technologies
. close association with our clientele and end users
. a highly competitive compensation package, including full 
  benefits, overtime pay, and relocation expenses 
  reimbursement. 

As a result we have attracted a staff of highly-experienced
system-construction superstars who quickly assume leadership
positions on their projects.

As a member of ERS you will be involved with all aspects of
system development, from requirements elicitation through
production rollout.  Most positions require excellent coding
skills and the ability to guide the client through their first
use of rule-based or distributed-object systems.
