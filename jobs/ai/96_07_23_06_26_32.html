 			Istituto Trentino di Cultura
 		Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica
 		

The Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (IRST) is seeking a
person for a research position in case based reasoning (CBR) and machine
learning.  The position is advertised as part of a long term plan whose goal
is to strengthen the IRST group working in the area of Reasoning and CBR in
particular. The position requires highly motivated outstanding individuals
capable of working in a research group including researchers, programmers,
and students.

The successful candidate will be responsible for the development and
deployment of advanced case-based reasoning software. The position will
involve working on research and technology transfer projects, as defined by
IRST's research plan. The work will involve close collaboration with
industry. Publishing is encouraged.

Istituto Trentino di Cultura (ITC) is a regional research organisation
created in 1962, in order to promote research activities in the Trentino
area.  ITC has currently a staff of 200 full-time researchers (plus several
fellows, consultants and visiting scholars) and a 1996 provisional budget of
more than 13,100,000 ECU.

IRST is the main research centre of ITC. Its organisation and planning are
directed to pursue both basic and applied research, through a co-ordinated
design that integrates objectives of research excellence and responsiveness
to local, national, and international development needs. IRST's main efforts
are concentrated in interactive sensorial systems, cognitive and
communication technologies and in the design, fabrication and testing of
intelligent smart optical and bio-sensors.

The successful candidate will be in the Cognitive and Communication
Technologies division, working in a group of people concerned with Automated
Reasoning and Knowledge Representation. This group at the moment has nine
full time researchers, some post-docs, and various PhD and Master
students. More specifically, he or she will closely collaborate with the
people developing a state of the art CBR tool to be applied in a number of
different applications (Natural Resource Management, Fraud Detection, DSS in
the Banking environment).
