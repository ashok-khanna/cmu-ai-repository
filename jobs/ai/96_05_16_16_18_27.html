  Research Programmer Position Available

        Department of Psychology
        Carnegie Mellon University
        Pittsburgh, PA  15213  USA


The ACT-R research group is looking for a research programmer to
continue development of the ACT-R cognitive simulation software under
the general supervision of John R. Anderson.  

The current ACT-R system consists of an integrated development
environment and GUI running on Macintosh computers.  Also under
development are several separate components including a "visual toolkit"
used to interface ACT-R models with the computer screen to allow
real-world interaction between models and environment, a graphic
authoring tool to enable domain experts to create ACT-R models by
demonstration, and an experimental paradigm package to easily define new
experiments and interface them with the ACT-R system.  

Responsibilities of the person filling this position include extending
the functionality of these various components, integrating them with the
development environment, and using these tools to author ACT-R cognitive
models.

Prerequisites for the job are knowledge and experience of Common Lisp,
CLOS and GUI development, preferably using MCL.  Knowledge of AI
programming techniques and familiarity with cognitive science issues are
preferred.  The candidate would interact on a fairly autonomous basis
with our sizable research group and be able to participate in the CMU
cognitive science community.
