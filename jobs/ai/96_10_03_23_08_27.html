=46unding is available to support a three year research studentship in the
Department of Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen. This award
must be filled by November 30.

The project will focus on developing and evaluating techniques for data
mining on real databases, in collaboration with British Telecom Research
Laboratories. Opportunities exist to explore various aspects of machine
learning, including: the application of domain knowledge in guiding the
search for patterns in data; learning over distributed data; and the role
of first-order learning methods in data mining.


=46inancial support for the project will be provided by EPSRC and British
Telecom. Fees will be paid by EPSRC; the expected level of maintenance
support for 1996/97 is =A35540 from EPSRC, plus an additional =A32800 (appro=
