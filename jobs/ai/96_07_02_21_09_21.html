Position:  Computer Scientist
Project:   Operations Scheduling
Organization: Computational Sciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center

One position for computer scientist is available with the Operations
Scheduling project in the Computational Sciences Division at NASA Ames
Research Center. The research and development work of the Operations
Scheduling project is aimed at a problem of vital importance for the
US space program: dramatically reducing space mission operating costs
through the use of automation and Artificial Intelligence software
technology. Currently we are working on various project including the
Deep Space 1 (DS1) mission. Scheduled for launch in 1998 DS1 will be
the first mission Remote Agent, a highly autonomous flight operations
software. Remote Agent will generate plans on-board on the basis of a
few abstract goals, will execute generated plans, will monitor for
execution failures and will autonomously recover from them. The
Operations Scheduling project is working on on-board Planner/Scheduler 
component of the Remote Agent, which will be responsible for the
on-board expansion of the detailed execution plans on the basis of
a few, abstract goals communicated to the spacecraft from ground.

The successful candidate will be joining a highly motivated team 
in a very dynamic environment.

The successful candidate must satisfy the following requirements:

- American citizenship or permanent residency (this is a necessary
  condition for employment!);
- MS/PhD (or experiential equivalent) in Computer Science 
  or related fields;
- proficiency with the development of object-oriented systems;
- proficiency in the use of C++ and Unix;
- familiarity with search techniques, constraint propagation, operations
  research, planning and scheduling;
- good written and verbal skills.

The following skills will be consider as definite advantages for
the successful candidate:

- good working knowledge of Lisp;
- good working knowledge of VxWorks;

Motivation to learn quickly about the previous topics is a very strong
requirement.

The NASA Ames Research Center is located near Mountain View, in
northern California. The position offers a competitive compensation
package, excellent benefits, the opportunity to join a well-motivated,
hard-working team, and the chance to directly impact the future of the
US space program.
