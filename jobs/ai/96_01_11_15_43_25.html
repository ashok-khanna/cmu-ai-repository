UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS AND UMIACS
College Park, MD
CL Position Announcement: Tenure Track (open rank)

The Department of Linguistics and UMIACS (University of Maryland
Institute for Advanced Computer Studies) invite applications for a
position (open rank) in Computational Linguistics to begin in the Fall
semester of 1996. We seek candidates with established records of
research excellence who are interested in working on topics at the
interface of linguistic theory and computational modeling. The
candidate's work should complement research interests of current
faculty. Possible areas of interest include formal models of language
learning or models of the lexicon, syntactic or semantic components
that can be applied to computational problems such as automatic
acquisition of lexicons, parsing grammars, or semantic interpreters or
the implementation of these components for single language or cross
linguistic applications. Teaching experience is also desirable.  Ph.D.
is required by August, 1996. For best consideration, applications
should arrive by February 1, 1996. Applicants should send a complete
dossier (letter of application, CV, samples of published work) and
arrange to have three letters of recommendation sent to:

Professor Stephen Crain
Computational Linguistics Search Committee 
University of Maryland at College Park
1401 Marie Mount Hall
College Park, MD 20742

The University of Maryland is a AA/EO Title IX employer. Women and
minority candidates are especially encouraged to apply.
