The Soar Project at the University of Southern California's Information
Sciences Institute (USC/ISI) has a full-time opening for a research programmer
to participate in development of intelligent agents for virtual environments.
This is an exciting project that combines state-of-the-art research on
autonomous intelligent agents with the fielding of a real application.

Candidates should have a Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science and
have demonstrated the ability to construct and maintain large-scale,
leading-edge systems.  Candidates must also be able to work well in a
cooperative research environment and express their ideas clearly in
presentations and in writing.  An ideal candidate would have expertise in
artificial intelligence, simulation, C/UNIX, X, and Tcl/TK; although
candidates with significant expertise in a subset of these areas will be
considered.  A final consideration is eligibility for a U.S. security
clearance.  Although the research and development is not itself classified,
deployment of the resulting system may require access to classified
facilities.

USC/ISI -- which is located along the water in Marina del Rey, California (in
the Los Angeles area) -- is part of the USC School of Engineering and
maintains close academic ties with the Department of Computer Science. USC/ISI
is a leading research laboratory in computer science and engineering, with
approximately 250 staff members of whom more than 70 have advanced degrees,
and more than 40 others are pursuing advanced degrees. ISI provides an
exciting environment that encourages publication and the wide dissemination of
research results.

The Soar project at USC/ISI is situated within the Intelligent Systems
Division, an active group of approximately 60 AI researchers, programmers, and
students working in such areas as intelligent agents, knowledge
representation, natural-language translation, expert systems, knowledge
acquisition, machine learning, planning, human-computer interaction,
intelligent information integration, constraint satisfaction, education and
training.  It is also one of the lead sites in an international,
multi-disciplinary, community of researchers concerned with developing Soar as
the basis for both integrated intelligent systems and a unified theory of
cognition.

Qualified applicants should reference "Soar-95" and send resumes and
references via e-mail to resumes@isi.edu, or via US Mail to:
