This is my general posting for consultants. I also have that need for a
consultant who can work 40 hr weeks for up to 3 or 4 months in the New Jersey
area. That one deals with intelligent text handling and is immediately
available. The pay would be hourly and is generous and negotiable. 

Thanks, Dave

Hello my name is Dave Staats. I'm a CPC with over 10 years in aerospace 
and electronics recruiting. I am currently working to fill a number of 
openings with leading U.S. companies in AI/EXPERT SYSTEMS technology.
    I have an on-going need for full-time permanent employees who will 
function as billable consultants and work at the client site most of the 
time. Though travel will not always be 100%,you should approach the 
opportunity as though it will.You can be based in any number of major 
cities and will be home every weekend.Citizenship is not a requirement 
for these positions but consulting experience is.
     There are other positions in distributed processing,embedded 
processing,OO/RDBMS,and other advanced technology engineering 
disciplines.
     If you are an AI/EXPERT SYSTEMS HIRING MANAGER please call me. I may 
be able to help you too.
     Readers,please forward and crosspost this message to anyone it may 
help.
Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Dave Staats CPC
