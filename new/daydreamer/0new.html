Daydreamer is a computer model of the stream of
thought developed at UCLA by Erik T. Mueller from 1983 to 1988.
It implements the following:
<ul>
<li>daydreaming goals: strategies for what to think about
<li>emotional control of thought: triggering and direction
of processing by emotions
<li>hierarchical planning: achieving a goal by breaking
it down into subgoals
<li>analogical planning (chunking): storing successful
plans and adapting them to future problems
<li>episode indexing and retrieval: mechanisms for
indexing and retrieval of cases
<li>serendipity detection and application: a mechanism
for recognizing and exploiting accidental relationships
among problems
<li>action mutation: a strategy for generating new
possibilities when the system is stuck
</ul>
<p>
Daydreamer is in turn built upon GATE,
which provides basic AI tools such as slot-filler objects,
unification, instantiation, variabilization, theorem proving,
and contexts.
