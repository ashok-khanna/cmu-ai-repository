This document covers the following topics:

Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cabling (UTP)
===================================

The Allied Telesyn AT-2500TX PCI 10/100 Ethernet adapter has a RJ-45
connector for use with UTP cabling.

For more information on the 10BaseT specification, contact 
your local network supplier or call the IEEE at 
800-678-IEEE.

Recommended cables
------------------

The RJ45 connector can use 22, 24, or 26-gauge UTP cabling. 
The cable must comply with the IEEE 802.3 10BaseT standard.

The cable between the computer and the hub or switch must 
be no more than 100 meters long.

These UTP cables work well:

Manufacturer       Model number         No. of pairs
----------------------------------------------------
Belden             9562                 2
Data Set           2402                 4
Belden             9566                 6
Belden             1588A                2

Silver Satin is not within the 10BaseT specification and 
may not work or may work intermittently.


Cable and connector pinouts
---------------------------

If you need to repair a cable or provide connectors for 
UTP cable, wire straight through as shown in the 
following table.(A very few applications require a 
cross-over cable. To allow for a straight-through cable, 
the vast majority of hubs and switches provide an internal 
transmit/receive crossover function. This means the 
transmit circuit of the network card is connected to the 
receive circuit of the hub and vice-versa. Many hubs also 
have an external interface switch, the MDI/MDI-X switch. 

Straight-through cable pinout:

Function    Pin#               Pin#
-----------------------------------
TX+         1    <-------->    1
TX-         2    <-------->    2
RX+         3    <-------->    3
RX-         6    <-------->    6

Cross-over cable pinout:

Function    Pin#               Pin#
-----------------------------------
TX+         1    <-------->    3
TX-         2    <-------->    6
RX+         3    <-------->    1
RX-         6    <-------->    2

10BaseT and 100BaseTX uses only four of the eight pins. Pins
1 and 2 must be a pair within the cable, and pins 3 and 6 must
be a pair.


Link integrity
==============

There are three LEDs on the Allied Telesyn AT-2500TX PCI adapter:

100 light for 100 Mbps operation

ACT light for activity

LNK light for link (10Mb or 100Mb)

Refer to the "Diagnostic LEDs" information file for 
brief descriptions.

Note: The ACT LED indicates read/write activity on the 
network, not necessarily activity on the adapter.


Common problems
===============

No Link Light
--------------------------------

1. Check to cable pinout. Make sure the cable is a straight-through
   when connecting to a hub, or a cross-over cable if connected
   to another network interface card (workstation or server).

2. Make sure that the link light on both sides of the connection
   is on, ie both the AT-2500 and the device it is connected to
   has the link light illuminated. If the AT-2500 is not showing
   link, check the receive pair for the bad connection (pins 3 and 6).
   Conversely, check the transmit pair (pins 1 and 2) if the device
   on the other side has no link light illuminated.

Workstations cannot connect to a server
-----------------------------------------

1. Check to make sure the same protocol is being used by the workstation
   and the server, i.e. TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, Netbeui, etc.

2. Check for frame type mismatches with Novell NetWare servers. For
example, the server is set to use the 802.2 frame type, but the workstation
is using the 802.3 frame type.

3. Check for valid TCP/IP address, router, and DNS (Domain Name Server)
settings when browsing the Internet, or Intranet Web-servers.


High Amount of Collisions
-------------------------

This is usually caused by a loose connection, or by exceeding the
recommended limit of 100 meters (~333 ft.). Try a different cable.
Also check for duplex mismatches (half vs. full) between the two devices.

-------------------------

When all else fails, cycle power on your hub or switch to clear any
anomalies that may be occurring internally.

Polarity problems
-----------------

A common problem in 10BaseT wiring is crossing the positive 
and negative phases of the transmit and receive signals 
(for example, crossing pins 1 (TX+) and 2 (TX-)). Follow the EIA/TIA 768b
specification to ensure proper polarity.
