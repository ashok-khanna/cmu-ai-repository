This is an ASCII file called DOSREQ.TXT in the ATI 
CardAssistant INFO directory. Use a text editor or a 
word processor with a mono-space font such as Courier 
to print this file if needed for reference.

I.  Special Considerations
==========================

Configuration of the AT-2500TX is under PCI control, and 
the AT-2500TX is NWAY capable. For most applications, no 
setup other than normal installation of the network 
software is necessary. For any half-duplex application, the 
card by default auto-detects the speed of the link (10 Mbps 
or 100 Mbps). If the connection is full-duplex without NWAY 
capability, you must select one of the full-duplex settings.
In this case, refer to the "Connection speed and duplex" 
information file. 


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\A2500.NIF  (information file)
\A2500.DOS   (NDIS 2.0 Driver)
\INFO\DOSREQ.TXT   (this file)


III. Installing NDIS driver with DOS LAN Requester
==================================================
  
Before you start with the installation  process, make sure 
that DOS LAN Services is properly installed.  Similarly, 
your adapter should also be properly installed in your 
client PC.

1. Copy A2500.DOS from your CardAssistant diskette (A:\) 
   to DOS LAN Services subdirectory C:\DLS.

2. Under DOS LAN Requester subdirectory C:\DLS, run INSTALL.

3. The screen will display information, if it's correct 
   move the highlight to "The listed options are correct" 
   item, then press ENTER.

4. Move highlight to "Network Card", then press ENTER.

5. Select "Change driver for network card." item, then 
   press ENTER.

6. Select "Network card not shown in list below..", then 
   press ENTER.

7. Insert the AT-2500 driver diskette into the floppy drive 
   and specify your pathname A:\, then press ENTER.

8. The AT-2500 NDIS driver is now installed.  Finish the 
   DOS LAN SERVICES and then reboot the computer.


IV.  Removing an Existing Driver
================================

To complete de-installation of the NDIS2 driver, remove the 
driver line from the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or 
comment it out, and reboot.


V. How to Find the MAC Address
==============================

To determine a MAC address for a card:

1. Boot the computer into DOS with no drivers loaded.

2. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in the floppy drive 
   and launch SETUP25: type a:\setup25.

3. The main screen shows a table listing the AT-2500 
   Ethernet cards installed in the computer. Write down the 
   address(es) listed in the "MAC" column of the table.


VI. Adding Multiple Cards and Binding to the MAC Address
========================================================

The A2500.NIF file on the CardAssistant diskette does not 
contain necessary lines for multiple card installations. 
There are two different methods to make the necessary 
modifications if you are performing a multiple-card 
installation. Under DOS mode, you can modify the BusNo and 
DeviceNo keyword fields in the file C:\DLS\PROTOCOL.INI.
