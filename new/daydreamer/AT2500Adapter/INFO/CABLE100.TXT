NOTE: For 10 Mbps operation, refer to the "10 Mbps cabling
      specifications" information file.

This document covers the following topics:

Twisted-Pair Ethernet (TPE) cabling
===================================

The ATI AT-2500TX PCI adapter has an RJ-45 connector for 
use with TPE cabling. TPE cabling is also known as 
RJ-45 cabling, Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP), and 10BaseT 
cabling.

For more information on the 10BaseT specification, contact 
your local network supplier or call the IEEE at 
800-678-IEEE.

Recommended cables
------------------

For 100 Mbps operation, the cable must comply with the IEEE 
802.3 10BaseT standard for 2-pair, Category 5, UTP cable.

The cable between the computer and the hub must be less 
than 100 meters long.

This UTP cable works well:

Manufacturer     Model number       No. of pairs
------------------------------------------------
Belden           1588A              2


Cable and connector pinouts
---------------------------

If you need to repair a cable or provide connectors for 
UTP cable, wire straight through as shown in the 
following table.

Function    Pin#               Pin#
-----------------------------------
TX+         1    <-------->    1
TX-         2    <-------->    2
RX+         3    <-------->    3
RX-         6    <-------->    6

Use only four of the eight pins. Pins 1 and 2 must be a 
pair, and pins 3 and 6 must be a pair.

To allow for a straight-through cable, hubs and switches 
provide an internal transmit/receive crossover function. 
This means the transmit circuit of the network card is 
connected to the receive circuit of the hub and vice-versa.


Link integrity
==============

There are three LEDs on the ATI AT-2500TX PCI adapter:

100 light for 100 Mbps operation

ACT light for activity

LNK light for link

Refer to the "Diagnostic LEDs" information file for 
brief descriptions.

Note: The ACT LED indicates read/write activity on the 
network, not necessarily activity on the adapter.


Common problems
===============

A hub can't detect a workstation
--------------------------------

This is often the result of a crossed wire in the cable or 
wiring closet. Make sure the wiring is correct.

Workstations can't connect to the network
-----------------------------------------

Make sure hub port is configured to the correct speed. 

Reset or power off/on your hub or switch.

Polarity problems
-----------------

A common problem in 10BaseT wiring is crossing the positive 
and negative phases of the transmit and receive signals 
(for example, crossing pins 1 (TX+) and 2 (TX-)).
