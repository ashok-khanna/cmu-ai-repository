100:  Indicates 100 Mbps when on, and 10 Mbps when off.

ACT:  Indicates read/write activity on the network. It 
      doesn't always mean there is activity on this adapter.
      If the ACT light isn't on, make sure the network is 
      operating and the drivers are loaded.

LNK:  Indicates the adapter is connected to a hub or switch 
      and is receiving link pulses. If the LNK light isn't 
      on, check all connections at the adapter. Make sure 
      the hub or switch is transmitting at the correct speed 
      and the drivers are loaded.

      Also, make sure you have the correct wiring 
      configuration for the adapter. A few hubs and 
      switches require a cross-over cable rather than a 
      straight-through cable.
