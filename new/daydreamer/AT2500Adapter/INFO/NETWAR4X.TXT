I.  Special Considerations
==========================

Configuration of the AT-2500TX is under PCI control, and 
the AT-2500TX is NWAY capable. For most applications, no 
setup other than normal installation of the network 
software is necessary. For any half-duplex application, the 
card by default auto-detects the speed of the link (10 Mbps 
or 100 Mbps). If the connection is full-duplex without NWAY 
capability, you must select one of the full-duplex settings.
In this case, refer to the "Connection speed and duplex" 
information file. 



II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\NWSERVER\A2500v3.LAN   (Server driver)
\NWSERVER\A2500v3.LDI   (Novell NetWare V4.11 Server Driver 
                       Installation Information File)
\INFO\NETWAR4X.TXT (this file)


III. Installing the AT-2500: New Server Installation
====================================================

1. Follow the directions provided by Novell to load the 
   network drivers by using the Install.nlm program.

2. When the Install program prompts for the LAN driver, 
   press <Insert> to specify a driver not listed.  Insert 
   the AT-2500 CardAssistant diskette into a drive and 
   press <F3> to change the default path to A:\NWSERVER. 
   Press <Enter> as prompted. The A2500v3.LAN and other 
   required files will be copied to the SYS: volume.

3. On the next menu, AT2500 Protocols and Parameters, 
   specify any parameters where needed. A slot value is 
   required when loading the AT2500, if slot is unknown, 
   driver will correctly detect slot value when loading.

4. Select "Save parameters and load driver".

Proceed with the installation as outlined by Novell.


IV. Manual Installation
=======================

1. At the file server console prompt, issue the load 
   statement(s) in this order:

   LOAD <DRIVE>:<PATH>\A2500v3

   where <DRIVE> and <PATH> are the drive and directory 
   where you copied the NLMs and the A2500v3.LAN file, and 
   where X is the last digit of the NetWare version number.

   Note: If MSM and ETHERTSM NLMs aren't loaded, they'll 
         automatically load before the driver.

You will be prompted if you don't specify a SLOT number.

2. Next you must bind the LAN driver to IPX in order to 
   attach to the server. Type:

    BIND IPX TO A2500v3 NET=n

   where n is the node address Novell uses for routing 
   IPX packets. This number is arbitrary if there is the 
   only one server on the network, but if there are 
   multiple servers on the same network, it must match the 
   other servers' external network number.

Note: The default frame type for Novell file servers is now 
      Ethernet_802.2. If you require Ethernet_802.3, 
      specify FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 on the command line when 
      loading the driver.

To load multiple frame types for a single card, enter a 
LOAD and BIND statement for each frame type.  You need to 
supply a name on each load line in order to avoid being 
prompted for which board to bind IPX to. If you do not have 
the name option in the AUTOEXEC.NCF, it will not execute 
completely without user intervention. 

Example:
    LOAD A2500v3 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.3 NAME=IEE8023
    BIND IPX TO IEE8023 NET=11111
    LOAD A2500v3 FRAME=ETHERNET_802.2 NAME=IEE8022
    BIND IPX TO LAN8022 NET=22222

Also: If you have a PCI-1 bus in your system, add 
      BUSTYPE=PCI1 to the command line, e.g., 
      LOAD C:\SERVER.4\A2500v3 BUSTYPE=PCI1. 
      Otherwise the driver may not find the card. If you 
      don't know which bus you have, try loading without 
      the option. If it loads, you don't need it.

6. Add the load and bind statements you require to the 
server's AUTOEXEC.NCF file so that the LAN driver will load 
automatically each time the server starts up.

Here's an example of how the commands would look in your 
AUTOEXEC.NCF file. 

("NCF Files Options - Create / Edit Server Startup Files")

  LOAD A2500v3 FRAME=Ethernet_802.3 (overrides default frame 
                                    type)
  BIND IPX to A2500v3 net=1         (all servers on the LAN 
                                    segment need the same #)

Proceed with the installation as outlined by Novell.

V.  Removing an Existing Driver 
===============================

To de-install the driver, start NetWare and consult the 
NetWare documentation.


VI. How to See MAC Address
==========================

To determine a MAC address for a card:

1. Boot the computer into DOS with no drivers loaded.

2. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in the floppy drive 
   and launch SETUP25: type a:\setup25.

3. The main screen shows a table listing the AT-2500 Fast 
   Ethernet cards installed in the computer. Write down the 
   address(es) listed in the "MAC" column of the table.


VII. Multiple Adapters 
======================

If you have multiple AT-2500 Fast Ethernet adapters 
installed in the system, the keyword "SLOT" identifies each 
card to the driver. If you have multiple adapters in 
a single server, each adapter must have a different network 
number and SLOT number. Also, you might want to name each 
adapter. So add the options in LOAD commands to distinguish 
particular cards. For example:

      LOAD A2500v3 FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_A SLOT=1
      BIND IPX TO LAN_A NET=11
      LOAD A2500v3 FRAME=Ethernet_802.2 NAME=LAN_B SLOT=2
      BIND IPX TO LAN_B NET=22

Add the load and bind statements you need to the server's 
AUTOEXEC.NCF file so that the AT-2500 adapter drivers load 
automatically each time the server starts.

-  In an IPX internal router configuration (a server with 
   two adapters, each connected to a different network), 
   the data transfer rate across the router can be low. 
   This happens if client workstations have CPU speeds 
   equal to or higher than the server. You might be able to 
   increase the data transfer rate by adding the following 
   line to STARTUP.NCF:

      SET MAXIMUM INTERRUPT EVENTS = 100000

   The default setting is 10.

-  If you have problems loading the driver on multiple 
   adapters and the initialization fails due to 
   "Insufficient RCBs," increase the number of buffers 
   allocated to the server. Add the following to 
   STARTUP.NCF:
      
      SET MINIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 100 (or larger)
      SET MAXIMUM PACKET RECEIVE BUFFERS = 500 (or larger)

   The MINIMUM value you specify must be at least 30 times 
   the number of AT-2500 PCI adapters in the computer.

   Recommended settings:
      
      1-3 adapters:  100
      4 adapters:    150

The MAXIMUM you can specify depends on the amount of memory 
in the server, but it must be greater than the MINIMUM.
