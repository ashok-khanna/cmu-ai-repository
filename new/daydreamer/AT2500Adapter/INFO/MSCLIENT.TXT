I.  Special Considerations
==========================

Configuration of the AT-2500TX is under PCI control, and 
the AT-2500TX is NWAY capable. For most applications, no 
setup other than normal installation of the network 
software is necessary. For any half-duplex application, the 
card by default auto-detects the speed of the link (10 Mbps 
or 100 Mbps). If the connection is full-duplex without NWAY 
capability, you must select one of the full-duplex settings.
In this case, refer to the "Connection speed and duplex" 
information file. 


II. Files Needed for Installation
=================================

The following files are required for installation:

\OEMSETUP.INF  (information file)
\A2500.DOS   (NDIS 2.0 Driver)
\INFO\MSCLIENT.TXT   (this file)


III.  Installing NDIS Drivers
=============================

Before you start with the installation procedure, make sure 
that the adapter is properly installed and configured. 
Similarly, make sure that your Microsoft Network Client is 
properly installed. 

(If not, the installation utility SETUP.EXE is located on 
Microsoft Network Client v3.0 for MS-DOS Disk. Run 
SETUP.EXE from disk and the SETUP program screen will 
appear, and you must complete each of the questions. These 
options are specific to your needs. The installation 
procedure will transfer files to a specific directory on 
the client and modify existing configuration files to fit 
your specific needs.)

1. Change to the Microsoft Network Client subdirectory, and 
   run SETUP.EXE.

2. The screen will display some information. Press <Enter>. 

3. Respond to the screen prompts, selecting "Change 
   Network Configuration", then press <Enter>.

4. Move the highlight to "Add Adapter", press <Enter>.

5. Select "Network adapter not shown on list below ...".

6. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in floppy drive A:, 
   and specify your pathname A:\; then press <Enter>.

7. Follow screen instructions to complete the process. 
   Simply pressing <Enter> for each screen display will 
   select the default options. Press <Enter> until you 
   reach the display prompting you to reboot your system.

  [RTL8139]
  ; RTL8139 RPOTOCOL.INI SAMPLE

IV.  Removing an Existing Driver
================================

To complete de-installation of the NDIS2 driver, remove the 
driver line from the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or 
comment it out, and reboot.


V. How to See MAC Address
=========================

To determine a MAC address for a card:

1. Boot the computer into DOS with no drivers loaded.

2. Insert the CardAssistant diskette in the floppy drive 
   and launch SETUP25: type a:\setup25.

3. The main screen shows a table listing the AT-2500 Fast 
   Ethernet cards installed in the computer. Write down the 
   address(es) listed in the "MAC" column of the table.
