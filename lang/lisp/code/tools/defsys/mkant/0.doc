Summary:      Portable and flexible system definition facility for Common Lisp

Version:      2.5 8-JAN-92

Description: 

   This is a portable system definition facility for Common Lisp.
   Though home-grown, the syntax was inspired by fond memories of the
   defsystem facility on Symbolics 3600's. However, rather than follow in
   the Symbolic procedural approach, where the system definition
   intermixes compilation and other instructions in the definition, we
   took a structural approach. The system definition defines only the
   structure of the system. The order of files for compilation is
   computed using a topological sort of the file-dependency constraints.
   This divorces the actual operation from the structure of the system,
   permitting one to define other operations on the system. For example,
   Alex Repenning <ralex@cs.colorado.edu> has implemented an efficient
   Boyer Moore string search over the files in the system (see
   search-systems.lisp in the distribution).

Requires:     

Ports:        Should work in any valid Common Lisp. Tested in CMU CL,
              Allegro CL, Lucid CL, VAXLisp, MCL, AKCL, and IBCL.

              We would appreciate receiving copies of any improvements
              and bug fixes, so that we may (eventually) release a new
              improved version. (We have a backlog of about 50
              improvements to make; sorry about the delay.)
