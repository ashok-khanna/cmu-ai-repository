Summary:      A Portable System Definition Facility for Common Lisp

Version:      5.0, 11-AUG-92

Description: 
 
   In order to maintain a large system of modules with complex load and
   compile time dependencies, a declarative and central representation of
   a system, its subsystems and modules is preferable to one where these
   dependencies are associated with a particular module (e.g. by REQUIRE
   and PROVIDE).

   Since in Lisp the definition of other languages is a frequently used
   programming technique, the load and compile time dependencies are also
   parameterized by the compiler or loader to be used for a module or
   system.  The Portable System Definition Facility is intended to meet
   this need.

   Laubsch's DEFSYS is an extended version of the portable defsystem
   facility originally written by Douglas Rand <dsrand@mitre.org>.

   [Note: Laubsch's DEFSYS takes the procedural approach to system
   definition. This is the same approach used by the original
   Symbolics defsystem.]
