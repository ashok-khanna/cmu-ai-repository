Name:         XREF

Summary:      Static analysis cross-referencing tool for Common Lisp.

Version:      27-FEB-91

Description: 

   XREF is a portable static analysis cross referencing tool for Common
   Lisp. It determines the callers of functions and variables and is
   useful for mapping out the structure of a program. XREF is similar to
   the Symbolics Who-Calls and Xerox Masterscope programs. It includes an
   interface to Joe Bates' PostScript graphing tool (psgraph.lisp).

   When you change a function or variable definition, it can be useful to
   know its callers, in order to update each of them to the new
   definition. Similarly, having a graphic display of the structure
   (e.g., call graph) of a program can help make undocumented code more
   understandable. This static code analyzer facilitates both
   capabilities.  The database compiled by xref is suitable for viewing
   by a graphical browser. (Note: the reference graph is not necessarily
   a DAG. Since many graphical browsers assume a DAG, this will lead to
   infinite loops.  Some code which is useful in working around this
   problem is included, as well as a sample text-indenting outliner and
   an interface to Bates' PSGraph PostScript Graphing facility.)
