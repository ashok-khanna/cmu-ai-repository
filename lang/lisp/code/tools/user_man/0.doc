Name:         User Manual

Summary:      Automatical User Manual Creation

Version:      2.0 (20-OCT-94)

Description: 

   The Automatic User Manual Creation system is a portable system for
   automatically generating user's guides from the source definitions and
   their documentation strings. It uses several heuristics for formatting
   the documentation segments nicely. It can produce text (ASCII),
   Scribe, and LaTeX output.  If Waters' XP pretty printer is available,
   it uses that instead to format the argument lists.

Requires:     

Ports:        Portable. Tested in CMU CL, MCL, Allegro CL, and Lucid CL.

   The user guide for the program is included at the top of the source
   file. It was created using this program and provides a good example
   of its capabilities. It was created by evaluating 
   (create-user-manual "user-manual.lisp").
