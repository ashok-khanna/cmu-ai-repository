Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/psgraph/

Name:         PSGRAPH

Summary:      PostScript DAG Grapher

Version:      Jan-92

Description: 

   The PSGrapher is a set of Lisp routines that can be called to produce
   PostScript commands to display a directed acyclic graph. It uses the
   same basic algorithm as the ISI Grapher.  It is slower than the ISI
   grapher, but produces much prettier output than using Xdump to copy an
   ISI Grapher screen image to a PostScript printer.  It also allows
   arbitrary information to be displayed with a node, and can print as
   many output pages as are necessary to accommodate large graphs (subject
   to PostScript printer limits, typically one or two thousand nodes).

   The PSgrapher is small enough and easy enough to use to be included
   in other systems without pain.  

Requires:     

Ports:        Should work in any valid Common Lisp. Tested in CMU CL,
              Lucid CL, and Allegro CL.
