Summary:      Alternate syntaxes for Common Lisp

Version:      1.2

Description: 

   Generalized Lisp (or Glisp for short) is a coordinated set of high
   level syntaxes for Common Lisp.  Initially GLisp consists of three
   dialects: Mlisp, Plisp and ordinary Lisp, together with an extensible
   framework for adding others.  Mlisp (Meta-Lisp) is an Algol-like
   syntax for people who don't like writing parentheses. For example,
   one can write print("abc", stream) instead of (print "abc" stream).
   Plisp (Pattern Lisp) is a pattern matching rewrite-rule language.
   Plisp is a compiler-compiler; its rules are optimized for writing
   language translators.  All dialects may be freely intermixed in a
   file. The translators for all dialects are written in Plisp, as is
   the Glisp translator framework itself. Support routines for the
   translators are written in Mlisp and/or Lisp. All dialects are
   translated to Common Lisp and execute in the standard Common Lisp
   environment. 
   
Requires:     

Ports:        GLISP runs in MCL and has to be modified for other 
              Common Lisp implementations.
