Name:         CGOL

Summary:      Algol-like language that compiles into Common Lisp.

Version:      1

Description: 

   CGOL is algol-like language developed originally by Vaughn Pratt.
   This program is a Common Lisp implementation of CGOL that is
   translated into Lisp before execution. It was written by a UC
   Berkeley graduate student, Tom Phelps, as a term project, so there
   may still be some rough edges. There is a lot of documentation in
   the distribution, including the "original" CGOL memo (pratt.memo).
