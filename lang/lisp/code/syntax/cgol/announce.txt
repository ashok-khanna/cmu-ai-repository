Subject: CGOL for Common Lisp
--text follows this line--
There is a version of Pratt's CGOL in Common Lisp.  CGOL is an algol-like
language that is translated into Lisp before execution.

See

pub/cgol.1.tar.Z  on
peoplesparc.berkeley.edu  

(the number "1" may increase if newer versions are posted).  The
conversion was written by grad student Tom Phelps, at UC Berkeley, as
a course term project.  There are still some rough edges; Tom (and I)
invite further refinement.  There's a fair chunk of documentation in
the directory.

instructions...

ftp peoplesparc.Berkeley.EDU  or 128.32.131.14
 anonymous   %%response to name prompt
 yourname  %%response to password prompt
image    %% or maybe, for some ftp systems, binary rather than image
cd pub
get cgol.1.tar.Z
quit

on your (Unix) system, you do

% uncompress cgol.1.tar.Z
% tar xvf cgol.1.tar

in your new cgol.1 directory, you have a bunch of files.

Look at pratt.memo for the "original" CGOL memo. The postscript file
cgol.ps tells you more.  cgol.tex and cgol.bib are the sources for
that file.

Please keep me posted if you find this useful, find bugs, fix it up, etc.

Thanks
