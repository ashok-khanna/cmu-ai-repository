Summary:      Prosser's hybrid algorithms for the Constraint
              Satisfaction Problem

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains Patrick Prosser's hybrid algorithms for the
   binary constraint satisfaction problem. Search algorithms include 
   chronological backtracking, backmarking, backjumping, forward
   checking, graph-based backjumping, conflict-directed backjumping,
   backjumping with directed 2-consistency, forward checking with
   directed 2-consistency, conflict directed backjumping with directed
   k-consistency, forward checking with conflict-directed backjumping,
   with directed k-consistency, and various combinations.
