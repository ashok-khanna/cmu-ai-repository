Name:         Queue Search

Summary:      Queue-based implementation of generic search.

Version:      7-AUG-90

Description: 

   Queue-based implementation of a generic framework for search. It is
   intended as a pedagological tool for teaching students about the
   variety of forms of search as discussed in the AI literature,
   including depth-first search, hill climbing search, breadth-first
   search, beam search, best-first search, branch and bound, branch and
   bound with underestimates, and A* search.

   When learning about some types of search commonly used in AI systems,
   it often helps to think in terms of a queue of nodes to be searched.
   Given a function which tests for the goal node, a function which finds
   the node's children, a function which dequeues a node for testing, and
   a function which merges the children into the queue, one can implement
   a wide variety of search functions. Comparing the functions used can
   help the student understand the difference between the various types
   of search.
