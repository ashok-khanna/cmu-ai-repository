<H2>Queue Search: Queue-based implementation of generic search.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/code/search/queues/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
Queue-based implementation of a generic framework for search. It is
intended as a pedagological tool for teaching students about the
variety of forms of search as discussed in the AI literature,
including depth-first search, hill climbing search, breadth-first
search, beam search, best-first search, branch and bound, branch and
bound with underestimates, and A* search.

When learning about some types of search commonly used in AI systems,
it often helps to think in terms of a queue of nodes to be searched.
Given a function which tests for the goal node, a function which finds
the node's children, a function which dequeues a node for testing, and
a function which merges the children into the queue, one can implement
a wide variety of search functions. Comparing the functions used can
help the student understand the difference between the various types
of search.
