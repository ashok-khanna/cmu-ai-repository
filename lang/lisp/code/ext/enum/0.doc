Summary:      C-style ENUMs for Lisp

Version:      

Description: 

   In C, enums allow a compiler to optimize a switch statement by
   using the enums as array indices. One can achieve the same effect
   in Lisp case statements, if the keys are consecutive numbers. To avoid
   losing readability, one must use constants with #. to evaluate them at
   execution time.
