Name:         Logical Pathnames

Summary:      Portable logical pathnames implementation

Version:      Tue Apr  9 19:17:01 1991

Description: 

   A portable implementation of the X3J13 June 1989 specification for
   logical pathnames, as documented in Guy Steele's "Common Lisp: the
   Language" (2nd Edition), section 23.1.5 "Logical Pathnames".

   Logical Pathnames provide a facility for referring to pathnames in a
   portable manner. Logical pathnames are mapped to physical pathnames by
   a set of implementation dependent and site-dependent rules.
