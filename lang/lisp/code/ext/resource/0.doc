Name:         RESOURCES

Summary:      Portable implementation of resources.

Version:      February 1992

Description: 

   Resources are useful for avoid excessive consing and GCing by explicitly
   maintaining pools of objects for reuse, instead of creating them when
   needed and relying on the garbage collector to flush them when they are
   no longer needed. When an object is no longer needed, it is returned
   to the pool of objects of that type, and recycled when a new object
   of that type is needed. Using resources might wind up recycling objects
   faster than incremental GC, but it isn't clear whether there are
   any real time/space savings.
