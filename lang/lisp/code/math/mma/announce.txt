Faithful readers of this list may be aware of this program, but
it's gotten somewhat more capable, and can now be FTP'd from
here.  Here's an example of what it can do:
......
<cl> (tl)


In[1] := Timing[RatExpand[(x+y)^4]]

                       4      3        2  2        3    4
Out[1] = {0.0 Second, x  + 4 x  y + 6 x  y  + 4 x y  + y }
In[2] := Timing[RatExpand[(x+y+z)^15];done]

Out[2] = {0.23300001 Second, done}
In[3] := D[ArcTanh[x]^2,x]

         2 ArcTanh[x]
Out[3] = ------------
                 2
            1 - x
In[4] := Int[%,x]

                     2
Out[4] = (ArcTanh[x])
In[5] := Int[x^n,x]

                    n
Out[5] = integrate[x , x]
In[6] := integrate[y_^m_,y_]:= (y^(m+1)-1)/(m+1)

In[7] := Int[x^n,x]

               1 + n
         -1 + x
Out[7] = -----------
            1 + n
In[8] := Exit

<cl> 
....
That line [2] seems to be rather faster than Mathematica on the same
machine. The lines 3-7 illustrate the primitive "derivative-divides"
integration package, and the possibility of enhancing it by
pattern matching.
....

To reconstruct this on your unix system (I'm using Allegro Common Lisp,
and it should work on any hardware supporting it; it should also work
in other Common Lisps), do the following:

cd someplace with room for a few 100k bytes
type:

ftp peoplesparc.Berkeley.EDU  or 128.32.131.14
 anonymous   %%response to name prompt
 your name  %%response to password prompt
image    %% or maybe, for some ftp systems, binary rather than image
cd pub
get mma_1.5.tar.Z
quit

%%now you're out of ftp
uncompress mma_1.5.tar.Z
tar xvf mma_1.5.tar


%% you are now the proud possessor of the files
%% you should probably try to compile them.

.......
If you get a copy, I would appreciate e-mail (to fateman@cs.berkeley.EDU)
advising me of that fact, so I can keep you up on new features or
improvements. Of course I'd like to know of any
problems or successes you have.  On the other hand, I can't promise
to fix any particular problems, and there is no warranty.  If you
are interested in enhancing the behavior of this system for use
by others, please tell me. 

Important note:   This program  is a rough shell
that has only rudimentary (but fast) parsing, display, numeric evaluation,
polynomial/ rational simplification, integration, and some pattern matching. 
 It is not a substitute for Mathematica (r), Maple (r), etc.
generally, and is not intended
to compete with such commercial systems.  This system
can be used for experimentation ... e.g. insert an entirely
different evaluation strategy  or an entirely different numeric
system, and re-run your "Mathematica(r) source code" through it.
Or hook it up to your favorite other semantics for solve, integrate,
etc.  (e.g. JACAL, Reduce, Macsyma, Maple, ...).

It is difficult or impossible to do these experiments
with the commercial Mathematica.  Considering
WRI's recent legal note, perhaps they  want to make it
illegal to do these experiments with any other system 
that can read Mathematica source code.
