Name:         HIST

Summary:      Simple histogram facility using Format strings for output.

Version:      28-JUN-90

Description: 

   Hist is a macro of form (HIST (min max [bucket-size]) . body)

   Creates a histogram with buckets of the specified size (defaults to
   1), spanning the range from Low (inclusive) to High (exclusive), with
   two additional buckets to catch values below and above this range.
   The body is executed as a progn, and every call to Hist-Record within
   the body provides a value for the histogram to count.  When Body
   exits, the histogram is printed out and Hist returns NIL.

   A simple example:
      (hist (0 10) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 10)))

   This example may make the RANDOM distribution look more normal:
      (hist (0 10 2) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 10)))

   This example will show you overflow buckets:
      (hist (2 12) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 15)))

Requires:     Common Lisp.

Ports:        Fully portable.
