Name:         MAXIMA

Summary:      Information about MAXIMA for Common Lisp

Version:      4-155, 13-DEC-89

Description: 

   Maxima is a Common Lisp version by William Schelter based on the
   original Macsyma implemented at MIT. It is based on the release
   from MIT to the DOE of the original MACSYMA.
   
   We have not included MAXIMA in the repository because of concerns
   about the copyright status of the code. Although the changes made
   by William Schelter to port Maxima to Common Lisp are free, the
   original Macsyma isn't. One previously was able to obtain a license
   for MAXIMA from 
      National Energy Software Center (NESC)
      Argonne National Laboratory
      9700 South Cass Avenue
      Argonne, IL 60439
      Tel: 615-576-2606, 708-972-7250
   for fees ranging from $1300 to $2800, with the cheaper licenses for
   universities. However, the NESC doesn't seem to exist any more,
   so the status of the code is unclear. 

   A copy of a message from Richard Petti, President of Macsyma Inc.,
   on this issue is included in this directory.

Requires:     

Ports:        AKCL, Lucid, Allegro, TI CL and Symbolics CL. 
              AKCL provides the best performance for maxima according
              to William Schelter's tests [as of 25-JUN-87 --mk].
