Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/random/

Name:         

Summary:      Pseudo-random number generator implemented in Common Lisp.

Version:      17-MAY-93

Description: 

   This is a portable pseudo-random number generator for Common LISP. It
   is seedable, has a periord of 10^30 passes all of the statistical
   tests and is four times faster than the built-in ones provided in
   Allegro and Lucid.

   The program was converted from a C program that was converted from a
   FORTRAN program. The correctness of the generator can be verified by
   the TEST function at the end of the file.

   The FORTRAN version was written by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman of
   Florida State University. George Marsaglia originally proposed this
   algorithm (see reference below). The C port was performed by Karl-L.
   Noell <NOELL@DWIFH1.BITNET> and Helmut Weber <WEBER@DWIFH1.BITNET> of
   the FHW (Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, W. Germany) Department of Computer
   Science in April 1989.
