Name:         ILU

Summary:      Xerox PARC Inter-Language Unification

Version:      1.6.4 (18-JUN-94)

Description: 

   ILU (pronounced eye'-loo) is a system that promotes software
   interoperability via interfaces.  Interfaces between what?  Whatever
   units of program structure are desired; we call them by the generic
   term "modules".  They could be parts of one process, all written in
   the same language; they could be parts written in different languages,
   sharing runtime support in one memory image; they could be parts
   running in different memory images on different machines (on different
   sides of the planet).  A module could even be a distributed system
   implemented by many programs on many machines.  Calls across ILU
   interfaces involve only as much mechanism as necessary for the calling
   and called modules to interact.  In particular, when the two modules
   are in the same memory image and use the same data representations,
   the calls are direct local procedure calls -- no stubs or other RPC
   mechanisms are involved.

   ILU modules are known by their interfaces.  A module interface is
   specified once in ILU's object-oriented Interface Specification
   Language (called, simply, ISL).  For each of the particular
   programming languages supported by ILU (currently Common Lisp, ANSI C,
   C++, and Modula-3; Python, Tcl, and GNU Emacs-Lisp are in the works),
   a version of the interface in that particular programming language can
   be generated.  The ILU kernel library provides services which may be
   used by the language-specific interface to overcome intermodule
   language or address space differences.

   Many existing RPC systems, such as Xerox XNS Courier, ONC RPC, and OSF
   DCE RPC, have strong notions of interfaces.  ILU allows binding to
   such services provided by such systems if their interfaces can be
   described in ISL.  ISL has been designed to facilitate such
   description (currently, only for ONC RPC; Courier and DCE RPC are in
   progress).  The binding to such RPC services is done in such a way as
   to be indistinguishable from binding to other ILU modules.  In fact,
   properly constructed ILU modules can appear as native RPC services,
   and can be manipulated by non-ILU tools designed to work with those
   RPC services.

   Similarly, the Object Management Group's (OMG) Common Object Request
   Broker Architecture (CORBA) defines modules with explicit interfaces.
   ILU allows modules that can be described with a safe subset of OMG
   CORBA IDL to be used as ILU modules, as well, though the ILU object
   model is not quite the same as the OMG CORBA object model.  In fact,
   people wishing to experiment with CORBA may find ILU a useful
   experimental platform, as it does allow module specification with OMG
   IDL, and does generate ANSI C support as specified in Draft 1.2 of the
   OMG CORBA specification.  As the OMG specification for a C++ mapping
   is agreed upon, we intend to provide that mapping for our C++ support,
   as well.

   Release 1.6.4 is intended as a beta release.  Major efficiency
   improvements and some usability improvements are planned for the next
   release.  It has been tested lightly on SunOS 4.1.3, Sun's Solaris
   2.3, and SGI's IRIX 5.2.  It is designed to be highly portable, and a
   port to the Macintosh has been done (but is not included in this
   release).
