Name:         COVER

Summary:      Common Lisp test case coverage determination tool

Version:      15-SEP-91

Description: 

   The COVER Common Lisp test case coverage determination tool can help
   assess the coverage of a suite of test cases.  When a suite of test
   cases for a program is run in conjunction with COVER, statistics are
   kept on which conditions in the code for the program are exercised and
   which are not.  Based on this information, COVER can print a report of
   what has been missed.  By devising tests that exercise these
   conditions, a programmer can extend the test suite so that it has more
   complete coverage.
