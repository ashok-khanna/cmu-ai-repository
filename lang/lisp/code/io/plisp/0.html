PostScript is a programming language for the description of images on
a printed page.  Many laser printers now use PostScript.  A very rich
set of graphic operations which allow complex images to be described
in a simple and concise manner are provided by the PostScript
language.

While many systems, such as Tex, pic, or MacDraw, generate PostScript
code, none of these allow the user access to the full power of the
PostScript language.  However, programming directly in PostScript can
be difficult.  Both the syntax and semantics of the language are
oriented more toward simplicity of execution rather than ease of
programming.  The purpose of this compiler is to take the basic
structure of Common Lisp and use it as an alternative representation
of a PostScript program.  While the basic graphic operators of
PostScript are retained, Lisp-like function definition, control flow,
and variable binding become available.  Macros, defined constants, and
function libraries have also been provided.  The PLisp compiler
generates PostScript code which is guaranteed not to contain errors in
stack usage.
