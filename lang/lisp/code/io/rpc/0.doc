Name:         RPC

Summary:      Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC.

Version:      

Description: 

   Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC that currently runs only in
   Xerox Common Lisp, but was written with portability in mind. It has
   been the basis of many robust clients (including NFS) but includes
   little support for the implementation of network services.  The code
   was originally written by Jeff Finger while at Stanford, and has been
   subsequently revised at Xerox by Bill van Melle.

   The authors hope that someone will be enticed to: 
      (1) port the code other Common Lisp implementations; and further
      (2) extend the system to support implementation of servers
   Both of these are significant programming efforts, requiring
   familiarity with both SUN RPC and the foreign function interface of
   the target Lisp.  The first task also requires some familiarity with
   Interlisp-D.
