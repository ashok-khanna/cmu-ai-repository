Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/cbrk/

Name:         CBREAK

Summary:      Turns CBREAK mode on and off to allow Lisp to read the
              input character by character.

Version:      

Description: 

   Most UNIX-based Lisp implementations buffer the input until a
   carriage return is seen. This means that functions like
   READ-CHAR, LISTEN and READ-CHAR-NO-HANG don't work as the
   programmer might expect. For example to reply to Y-OR-N-P, one not
   only has to type a Y or N, but hit the return key as well.

   This package contains example code that shows how to turn CBREAK
   mode on and off from within Lisp.
