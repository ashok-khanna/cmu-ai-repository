Summary:      Lisp-based regular expression parser.

Version:      4/8/92

Description: 

   This regular expression parser operates by taking a regular expression
   and breaking it down into a list consisting of lisp expressions and
   flags.  The list of lisp expressions is then taken in turned into a
   lambda expression that can be later applied to a string argument for
   parsing.
