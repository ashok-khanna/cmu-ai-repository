Description: 

   surveys.tar.gz
      gcsurvey.ps
         Wilson, Paul R., "Uniprocessor Garbage Collection Techniques"
         Proceedings of the 1992 International Workshop on Memory Management,
         St. Malo, France, September 1992, Springer Lecture Notes in
         Computer Science #637. [Surveys garbage collection techniques.  
         Includes an excellent bibliography.]

      heaps.bib
         BibTeX bibliography of garbage collection and (to lesser degrees)
         memory hierarchies and other aspects of heap management (like
         persistence). 

      dgcsurvey.ps
         "Collection Schemes for Distributed Garbage" by Abdullahi,
         Miranda, and Ringwood. Also appears in the 1992 IWMM proceedings.

      cache.ps
         "Caching Considerations for Generational Garbage Collection", 
         by Wilson, Lam, and Moher, 1992 ACM Symposium on Lisp and 
         Functional Programming, San Francisco, California, June 1992.  

      rtgcdraf.ps
         Old draft of a paper about Wilson's non-copying hard
         real-time incremental garbage collection.  (A shorter and
         more up-to-date paper about the same system is in GC93/wilson.ps.)


   GC90.tar.gz
      Papers from the first (1990) OOPSLA GC workshop, organized
      by Eric Jul and Niels-Christian Juul.


   GC91.tar.gz
      Most of the papers from the 1991 OOPSLA Workshop on Garbage
      Collection in Object-Oriented Systems, organized by Wilson and Hayes.
      Henry Baker's Treadmill paper is not included; an improved
      version was published in SIGPLAN Notices a few months after the
      workshop. 


   GC93.tar.gz
      Papers from the 1993 OOPSLA workshop on Memory Management and
      Garbage Collection, organized by Eliot Moss, Paul Wilson, and Ben Zorn.
