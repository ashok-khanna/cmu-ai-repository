Subject: [6-0] General information about FTP Resources for Lisp

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .z, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .z suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from:
   prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

FTP sites for Lisp and Scheme interpreters and compilers are discussed
in the answer to questions [4-0] and [4-2] and in the Scheme FAQ. See
the entry on Macintosh Common Lisp in question [4-1] for information
on the CD-ROM of Lisp code that Apple distributes with MCL 2.0.

Subject: [6-1] Repositories of Lisp Software

There are several repositories of publicly redistributable and
public domain Lisp code. 

Common Lisp Repository:

   The Common Lisp Repository is accessible by anonymous ftp to
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/ [128.2.206.173]
   through the AFS directory
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/
   or by WWW from the URL   
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html
   and includes more than 250 megabytes of sources, including all
   freely distributable implementations and many programs. This
   repository supersedes the Lisp Utilities collection, and is now
   part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository.

   Programs in the repository include XREF (portable cross referencing
   tool for Lisp, similar to the Symbolics Who-Calls and the Xerox
   MasterScope programs), Brad Miller's initializations package for
   Allegro CL 4.0, DEFSYSTEM (portable system definition facility, a
   "Make" for Lisp), a portable implementation of the X3J13 June 1989
   specification for logical pathnames, METERING (a portable code
   time/space profiling tool), SOURCE-COMPARE (a portable "diff" utility
   for Lisp), USER-MANUAL (a program which helps with documenting Lisp
   code), PSGRAPH (Joe Bates' PostScript DAG grapher), several matchers
   for Lisp, NREGEX (a regular expressions matcher), a date formatter, an
   infix reader macro for Lisp, SAVE-OBJECT (Kerry Koitzsch's package to
   save ASCII representations of Lisp objects to a file), Stephen
   Nicoud's semi-portable CLtL2 version of defpackage, LALR (Mark
   Johnson's lisp YACC parser generator), various implementations of the
   Loop Macro, William Schelter's sloop macro, Frank Ritter and Jim
   Panagos' implementation of the Yale yloop macro (described in
   McDermont, Charniak and Riesbeck's AI programming book), all free Lisp
   GUIs, including Express Windows, the iterate macro, Waters' Series
   Macro package, Waters' XP Lisp Pretty Printer, Bruno Haible's
   implementation of the Simplex algorithm, MAPFORMS (Moon's code
   walker), Brad Miller's resources package, and much much more.

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else 
   in the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is in the
   works.  We also plan to make the source code (including indexes) to
   this program available, as soon as it is stable.

   Most of the Common Lisp Repository appears on Prime Time Freeware
   for AI, Issue 1-1, a mixed-media book/CD-ROM publication. It
   includes two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs bound into a 224 page book and sells
   (list) for US$60 plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. For more
   information write to Prime Time Freeware, 370 Altair Way, Suite 150,
   Sunnyvale, CA  94086  USA, call 408-433-9662, 408-433-0727 (fax),
   or send email to ptf@cfcl.com.

   PAIL (Portable AI Lab) is a computing environment containing a
   collection of state-of-the-art AI tools, examples, and documentation.
   It is aimed at those involved in teaching AI courses at university
   level or equivalent. The system has enough built-in functionality to
   enable its users to get practical experience with a broad range of AI
   problems without having to build all the supporting tools from
   scratch. It is implemented in Common Lisp and uses CLOS and Allegro
   Common Windows (i.e., in Allegro CL 4.1). It is available by anonymous

   The benchmarks are described in the book "Performance Evaluation of
   Lisp Systems", by Richard Gabriel. 

   Lucid CL contains a set of benchmarks in its goodies/ directory,
   including Bob Boyer's logic programming benchmark, a benchmark to
   create and browse through an AI-like database of units, a CLOS speed
   test, a compilation speed test, TAKR (the 100 function version of TAK
   that tries to defeat cache memory effects), CTAK (A version of the
   TAKeuchi function that uses the CATCH/THROW facility), STAK (A version
   of the TAKeuchi function with special variables instead of parameter
   passing), DERIV and DDERIV (Symbolic derivative benchmarks written by
   Vaughn Pratt), DESTRU (a destructive operation benchmark), DIV2 (a
   benchmark which divides by 2 using lists of n ()'s), the FFT benchmark
   written by Harry Barrow, FPRINT (a benchmark to print to a file),
   FRPOLY (a Franz Lisp benchmark by Fateman based on polynomial
   arithmentic), Forest Baskett's PUZZLE benchmark (originally written in
   Pascal), the TPRINT benchmark to read and print to the terminal, a
   benchmark that creates and traverses a tree structure, and TRIANG
   (board game benchmark). Some of the benchmarks may work only in Lucid.

Blackboard Architectures:

   The UMass GBB system (V1.2) is available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.cs.umass.edu:/gbb. The commercial GBB product is not.
   Work on the UMass GBB project (and funding) ended over 2 years ago.
   Many researchers using it have opted for the commercial
   release.  The UMass research system remains available, but the
   two should not be confused as the commercial system is
   substantially improved and extended. The commercial system is
   available from Blackboard Technology Group, 401 Main Street, Amherst,
   Massachusetts 01002, telephone 800-KSS-8990 or 413-256-8990, fax
   413-256-3179.

   For a tutorial on how to build a blackboard system, see the paper
      P. R. Kersten and Avi C. Kak, "A Tutorial on LISP Object-Oriented
      Programming for Blackboard Computation (Solving the Radar Tracking
      Problem)", International Journal of Intelligent Systems 8:617-669, 1993
   Although samples of the code are given in the paper, the full source
   code is available in a separate technical report from the School of
   Electrical Engineering at Purdue University.  If you are interested in
   getting a copy of the technical report, send mail to Avi Kak
   <kak@ecn.purdue.edu>. (The circumstances under which the software was
   developed prevent them from making the source code available by
   anonymous FTP. However, the full source code is printed in the
   technical report.)

Case-based Reasoning:

   CL-Protos is a Common Lisp implementation of the case-based
   reasoning system developed by E. Ray Bareiss and Bruce W.
   Porter of the University of Texas/Austin AI Lab. It runs
   on Sun3, TI Explorer, HP 9000, and Symbolics, and gobbles a
   huge amount of memory. Common Lisp implementation by
   Rita Duran, Dan Dvorak, Jim Kroger, Hilel Swerdlin, and Ben Tso.
   For more information, bug reports, or comments, contact
   either Dan Dvorak <dvorak@cs.utexas.edu> or Ray Bareiss
   <bareiss@ils.nwu.edu> or Erik Eilerts <eilerts@cs.utexas.edu>
   Available by anonymous ftp from cs.utexas.edu:/pub/porter

   The complete code for "Inside Case-Based Reasoning" by Riesbeck and
   Schank, 1989, is available by anonymous ftp from

   Hammond and MICRO-xxx. Contact Bill Andersen <waander@cs.umd.edu>
   for more information.  

CLOS Software:
   See question [5-6].

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 
      ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z
   Contact Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@ai.mit.edu> for further
   information. Screamer is also available from the Common Lisp Repository.

   The Screamer Tool Repository, a collection of user-contributed
   Screamer code, is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/screamer-tools/
   or by WWW from
      http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~screamer-tools/home.html
   Please direct all inquires about the repository to
   screamer-repository@cis.upenn.edu. 

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/
   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt <ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk> and Jens
   Doerpmund <dorpmunj@cs.man.ac.uk> and runs in Common Lisp.

Eliza and Similar Programs:

   See Peter Norvig's book and AI_ATTIC (question [6-1] above).

   The doctor.el is an implementation of Eliza for
   GNU-Emacs emacs-lisp. Invoke it with "Meta-X doctor"

   muLISP-87 (a MSDOS Lisp sold by Soft Warehouse) includes
   a Lisp implementation of Eliza.

   Implementations of ELIZA for other languages are mentioned in the AI FAQ.

   The original Parry (in MLISP for a PDP-10) is available in
   labrea.stanford.edu:/pub/parry.tar.Z.

   Other programs, such as RACTER, are listed in part 4 of the AI FAQ.

Expert Systems:

   FOCL is an expert system shell and machine learning program written in
   Common Lisp. The machine learning program extends Quinlan's FOIL
   program by containing a compatible explanation-based learning
   component.  FOCL learns Horn Clause programs from examples and
   (optionally) background knowledge. The expert system includes a
   backward-chaining rule interpreter and a graphical interface to the
   rule and fact base. For details on FOCL, see: Pazzani, M. and Kibler,
   D., "The role of prior knowledge in inductive learning", Machine
   Learning 9:54-97, 1992. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      ics.uci.edu:/pub/machine-learning-programs/
   as the files README.FOCL-1-2-3, FOCL-1-2-3.cpt.hqx (a binhexed,
   compacted Macintosh application), FOCL-1-2-3.tar.Z (Common Lisp
   source code), and FOCL-1-2-3-manual.hqx (binhexed manual).  If you
   use a copy of FOCL, or have any comments or questions, send mail to
   pazzani@ics.uci.edu.

   BABYLON is a development environment for expert systems. It
   includes frames, constraints, a prolog-like logic formalism, and a
   description language for diagnostic applications. It is implemented in
   Common Lisp and has been ported to a wide range of hardware platforms.

   on the Apple CD-ROM, or with the book "The AI Workbench BABYLON",
   which contains *full source code* of BABYLON and the stand-alone
   version for the Mac. The book describes the use of BABYLON in detail.

   OPS5 is a public domain Common Lisp implementation of the OPS5
   production system interpreter written by Charles Forgy. It is
   available from the CMU AI Repository in
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/expert/ops5/
   and includes the original port by George Wood and Jim Kowalski

   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision, a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600
   and higher, VAX Common Lisp, and MCL. The XGinseng interface is built
   on top of Garnet.  SNePS 2.1 is free according to the GNU General
   Public License version 2. The SNePS distribution is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.buffalo.edu:/pub/sneps/  [128.205.32.9] 
   as the file rel-x-yyy.tar.Z, where 'x-yyy' is the version. The other
   files in the directory are included in the distribution; they are
   duplicated to let you get them without unpacking the full distribution
   if you just want the bibliography or manual. If you use SNePS, please
   send a short message to shapiro@cs.buffalo.edu and
   snwiz@cs.buffalo.edu. Please also let them know whether you'd like to
   be added to the SNUG (SNePS Users Group) mailing list. 

   COLAB (COmpilation LABoratory) is a hybrid knowledge representation
   system emphasizing the horizontal and vertical compilation of
   knowledge bases. It is comprised of cooperating subsystems -- CONTAX,
   FORWARD, RELFUN and TAXON -- which deal with different knowledge
   representation and reasoning formalisms. Each subsystem can also be
   used as stand-alone system. CONTAX deals with constraint nets and
   constraint-propagation techniques. Relational knowledge in the form of
   Horn rules is processed by forward (FORWARD) and backward (RELFUN)
   chaining. Taxonomic knowledge is represented by intensional concept
   definitions which are automatically arranged in a subsumption
   hierarchy (TAXON).  The COLAB software was developed at DFKI and the
   University of Kaiserslautern and runs in Common Lisp. (The subsystems
   have been tested in AKCL and Lucid CL, and possibly also Allegro CL
   and Symbolics CL.) All the subsystems are available free of charge for
   research purposes.

Languages and Alternate Syntaxes:

   Generalized Lisp (or Glisp for short) is a coordinated set of high
   level syntaxes for Common Lisp.  Initially GLisp consists of three
   dialects: Mlisp, Plisp and ordinary Lisp, together with an extensible
   framework for adding others.  Mlisp (Meta-Lisp) is an Algol-like
   syntax for people who don't like writing parentheses. For example,
   one can write print("abc", stream) instead of (print "abc" stream).
   Plisp (Pattern Lisp) is a pattern matching rewrite-rule language.
   Plisp is a compiler-compiler; its rules are optimized for writing
   language translators.  All dialects may be freely intermixed in a
   file. The translators for all dialects are written in Plisp, as is
   the Glisp translator framework itself. Support routines for the
   translators are written in Mlisp and/or Lisp. All dialects are
   translated to Common Lisp and execute in the standard Common Lisp
   environment. Glisp is available by anonymous ftp from apple.com or 
      ftp.apple.com:/dts/mac/lisp/glisp.tar.Z
   GLISP runs in MCL and has to be modified for other Common Lisp
   implementations. 

   CGOL is algol-like language that is translated into Lisp before
   execution. It was developed originally by Vaughn Pratt. A Common Lisp
   implementation of CGOL is available by anonymous ftp from
      peoplesparc.berkeley.edu:/pub/cgol.1.tar.Z  [128.32.131.14]
   (The number "1" may increase if newer versions are posted.)  It was 
   written by a UC Berkeley graduate student, Tom Phelps, as a term
   project, so there may still be some rough edges. There is a lot of
   documentation in the distribution, including the "original" CGOL memo
   (pratt.memo). For more information, contact Richard Fateman
   <fateman@peoplesparc.berkeley.edu>.

Lisp Tools:

   See the Common Lisp Repository in [6-2].

   The Automatic Memoization Facility adds a practical memoization
   facility to Common Lisp. Automatic memoization is a technique by which
   an existing function can be transformed into one that "remembers"
   previous arguments and their associated results, yielding large
   performance gains for certain types of applications.  This facility
   extends the ideas from Norvig's book into what is needed for a
   practical tool for us in large programs. It adds facilities for
   bookkeeping and timing, and lets you evaluate of the timing advantages
   of memoization, and save hash tables to disk for automatic reuse in
   later sessions. The code is available by anonymous ftp from
   archive.cs.umbc.edu:/pub/Memoization [130.85.100.53]. Contact Marty Hall
   <hall@aplcenmp.apl.jhu.edu> for more information. The code includes an
   overview of memoization and its applications.

   DEFTABLE provides a macro that unifies the interface to Common
   Lisp's table-like data structures (e.g., association lists, property
   lists, and hash tables). Written by Peter Norvig
   <norvig@harlequin.com>.  It is available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/lptrs/deftable.lisp [128.52.32.6] and also the
   Lisp Utilities Repository. An article describing deftable was
   published in ACM Lisp Pointers 5(4):32-38, December 1992.

   SEQUEL (SEQUEnt processing Language) is designed both as a general
   purpose AI language for generating type-secure and efficient Lisp
   programs and as a very high level specification language for
   implementing logics on the computer. Designed at the University of
   Leeds, SEQUEL compiles sequent-calculus specifications of arbitrary
   logics to working proof assistants.  The sequent calculus
   specifications are compiled into Horn clauses and from Horn clauses
   into virtual machine instructions of an abstract machine SLAM (SequeL
   Abstract Machine) which then translates these instructions into
   efficient Lisp code using WAM-style compilation techniques.  Although
   a functional programming language, SEQUEL includes facilities for
   backtracking usually associated with logic programming, and supports a
   pattern-matching method of building functions based on Prolog
   notation.  The Lisp code generated from SEQUEL functions is completely
   portable and runs in most Common Lisp implementations. It is
   comparable in efficiency with hand-written code.  SEQUEL also supports
   optional static type-checking in the manner of SML and similar
   languages.  With type-checking enabled, all inputs and loaded files
   are type-checked and the resulting Lisp programs are type-secure.  The
   SEQUEL compiler uses the information gleaned from type-checking to add
   compiler directives within the generated Lisp functions to produce
   optimized Lisp programs.  SEQUEL includes a UNIX-style top level with
   its own trace package and type-checking debugger. SEQUEL is also of
   interest to automated reasoning researchers. It provides a very
   powerful means of generating proof assistants and theorem provers that
   have a very fast performance using WAM-derived compilation techniques.
   The theorem provers are automatically verified. It includes a facility
   for Datalog and an efficient occurs-check Horn-clause-to-Lisp
   compiler, a mouse driven graphical interface for all proof assistants
   and theorem provers built under SEQUEL (currently available only under
   Lucid).  Several demonstration theorem provers for different logics,
   including FOL, Clarke's logic of space, partial evaluation, set
   theory, and constructive type theory are available.  SEQUEL runs under
   Kyoto CL, Lucid CL, and CMU Common Lisp.  SEQUEL is available free for
   non-commercial purposes by anonymous ftp from
      agora.leeds.ac.uk:/scs/logic/  [129.11.144.130]
   and includes LaTeX documentation in the distribution. For more
   information, contact Mark Tarver <mark@scs.leeds.ac.uk> or 
   <csc6mt@gps.leeds.ac.uk>. 

   ILU (Xerox PARC Inter-Language Unification) is a system for promoting
   language interoperability via interfaces between units of program
   structure called "modules". ILU currently supports Common Lisp, ANSI
   C, C++, and Modula-3. The Common Lisp support provides CLOS `network
   objects' that communicate via RPC between Lisp processes, as well
   between Lisp and other languages.  ILU is available by anonymous ftp
   from

   RWM (Refinement With Macros) is a Common Lisp program for learning
   problem solving strategies. RWM takes a high level description of a
   problem as input and successively refines it into a sequence of
   "easier" subproblems, which collectively constitute a strategy for
   solving the given problem. RWM also learns macro moves which are
   useful for efficiently solving the problem. A short documentation and
   some example problems/strategies are included. To get a copy of this
   description, send mail to the Bilkent University Archieve Server

   CommonORBIT (also called CORBIT) is an object-oriented extension of
   Common Lisp.  It uses a prototype (classless) model of OOP, is easy to
   use and yet has many sophisticated features found also in KL-ONE type
   languages.  CommonORBIT is a Common Lisp reimplementation of ORBIT,
   which was originally conceived by Luc Steels around 1981-1983.
   Because of its delegation-based rather than class-based inheritance,
   CommonORBIT offers extreme flexibility to define and change
   practically anything at run-time.  Because of the generic functions,
   it fits well into regular Lisp code.  It can co-exist with CLOS but
   remains completely separate. The source code of CommonORBIT is in the
   public domain and available by anonymous ftp from the Lisp
   Utilities Repository,
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/lisp/
   in the oop/non-clos/corbit/ subdirectory as the file corbit.tar.gz. 
   Documentation is available as the files corbit.msword.hqx, corbit.ps
   or corbit.text. A stripped-down version of CORBIT, known as BOOPS
   (Beginner's Object-Oriented Programming System), is also available
   from the repository as boops.tar.Z. For further information,
   contact the author, Koenraad de Smedt <desmedt@ruls40.LeidenUniv.nl>.

   IPG (Incremental Parser Generator) is available by email from 
   Jan Rekers <rekers@cwi.nl>.  It is an appendix to his thesis. It is
   written in LeLisp, but should be portable to other Lisp dialects.

   Zebu 2.8.5 is a parser generator for Common Lisp by Joachim H. Laubsch
   <laubsch@hplabs.hpl.hp.com>.  It is an extention written in Common
   Lisp of the Scheme version.  It generates a LALR(1) parsing table.  To
   parse a string with a grammar, only this table and a driver need to be
   loaded. The present version of Zebu contains the ability to define
   several grammars and parsers simultaneously, a declarative framework
   for specifying the semantics, as well as efficiency related
   improvements.  The current version compiles a grammar with 300
   productions (including dumping of the tables to disk) in approx 2
   minutes and 30 seconds on a HP 9000/370.  This implimentation has been
   tested in Lucid CL, Allegro CL, and MCL 2.0b. The current version
   can also produce a generator in addition to a parser. A copy may be
   found on cambridge.apple.com:/pub/mcl2/contrib/zebu-2.2.tar.Z.

   CLASP (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package) provides the basic
   functionality of a statistics package. It is implemented on top of
   CLOS and CLIM on a variety of platforms, and uses BBN's SciGraph
   package for plotting. The CLIM interface includes a "notebook" that is
   both a "desktop" for icons and a Lisp interactor pane.  The Common
   Lisp Instrumentation Package (CLIP) is available along with CLASP.
   CLIP is designed to allow AI system developers andevaluators a
   portable way to define and manage "alligator clips" for instrumenting
   their programs.  CLIP produces data about program behavior in CLASP
   format, as well as other commonly used data formats.  It currently has
   facilities to support experiment design, such as scenario scripting
   and factorial combination of independent variables, and can collect
   data in summary form (at the end of each trial) or based upon the
   occurrence of specific events (both periodic and non-periodic).  CLASP
   is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cs.umass.edu:/pub/eksl/clasp/
   and CLIP is in the directory 
      ftp.cs.umass.edu:/pub/eksl/clip/

Subject: [6-6] Formatting code in LaTeX (WEB and other literate
               programming tools) 

SLaTeX is a R4RS-compliant Scheme program that allows you to write
program code "as is" in your LaTeX or TeX source.  It is particularly
geared to the programming languages Scheme and Common Lisp, and has
been tested in Chez Scheme, Common Lisp, MIT C Scheme, Elk, Scheme->C,
SCM and UMB Scheme on Unix; and MIT C Scheme and SCM on MSDOS.  The
formatting of the code includes assigning appropriate fonts to the
various tokens in the code (keywords, variables, constants, data), at
the same time retaining the proper indentation when going to the
non-monospace (non-typewriter) provided by TeX.  SLaTeX comes with two
databases that recognize the standard keywords/variables/constants of
Scheme and Common Lisp respectively.  These can be modified by the
user using easy TeX commands.  In addition, the user can inform SLaTeX
to typeset arbitrary identifiers as specially suited TeX expressions
(i.e., beyond just fonting them).  The code-typesetting program SLaTeX
is available by anonymous ftp from 
   cs.rice.edu:/public/dorai/slatex23.tar.gz
Send bug reports to dorai@cs.rice.edu.

SchemeWEB provides simple support for literate programming in Lisp.
SchemeWEB version 2.0 is a Unix filter that allows you to generate
both Lisp and LaTeX code from one source file.  The generated LaTeX
code formats Lisp programs in typewriter font obeying the spacing in
the source file.  Comments can include arbitrary LaTeX commands.
SchemeWEB was originally developed for the Scheme dialect of Lisp, but
it can easily be used with most other dialects.  Version 2.0 is
available in the Scheme Repository as
   cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/new/schemeweb.sh
or in the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) in the directory
   ftp.shsu.edu:/tex-archive/web/schemeweb 

LiSP2TeX is a system that allows easy insertions of Scheme, or Lisp,
code towards TeX files. The originality of LiSP2TeX is that it
extracts Scheme definitions from the files where they appear and wraps
them appropriately within TeX macros for insertion into the
documentation file. LiSP2TeX decorrelates writing documentation from
programming: it is therefore possible to separately develop programs
and documentations and to merge them at the end to produce up to date
final documents. LiSP2TeX also has some pretty-printing capabilities
to produce denotations full of greek letters. It is available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/icsla/.

Subject: [6-8] World-Wide Web (WWW) Resources

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia document that spans the
Internet.  It uses the http (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the
light-weight exchange of files over the Internet.  NCSA Mosaic is a
World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). 

Mosaic's popularity derives, in part, from its ability to communicate
using more traditional Internet protocols like FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
NNTP, in addition to http. Mosaic can display text, hypertext links,
and inlined graphics directly. When Mosaic encounters a file type it
can't handle internally, such as Postscript documents, mpeg movies,
sound files, and JPEG images, it uses an external viewer (or player)
like Ghostscript to handle the file. Mosaic also includes facilities
for exploring the Internet. In other words, Mosaic is an multimedia
interface to the Internet.

The hypertext documents viewed with Mosaic are written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).  All that is needed is just a few more
improvements, such as the ability to format tables and mathematics,
and a WYSIWYG editor, for HTML to greatly facilitate electronic
journals and other publications.

NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is available by anonymous ftp from  
   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Mosaic/
as source code and binaries for Sun, SGI, IBM RS/6000, DEC Alpha OSF/1, DEC
Ultrix, and HP-UX. Questions about NCSA Mosaic should be directed to
