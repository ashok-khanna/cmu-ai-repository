<H2>GARNET: One of the biggest and best GUIs for Lisp.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/lisp/gui/garnet/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
Garnet is a large and flexible GUI that includes lots of high-level
features.  It does *not* depend on CLOS, but uses its own custom
object system (called KR) instead. Garnet (version 2.0 and after)
is now in the public domain, and has no licensing restrictions, so
it is available to all foreign sites and for commercial uses.

Garnet includes the Lapidiary interactive design tool, C32 constraint
editor, spreadsheet object, Gilt Interface Builder, automatic display
management, two widget sets (Motif look-and-feel and Garnet
look-and-feel), support for gesture recognition, and automatic
constraint maintenance, application data layout and PostScript
generation.

Garnet helps implement highly-interactive, graphical, direct
manipulation programs for X11 in Common Lisp.  Typical applications
include: drawing programs similar to Macintosh MacDraw, user interfaces
for expert systems and other AI applications, box and arrow diagram
editors, graphical programming languages, game user interfaces,
simulation and process monitoring programs, user interface construction
tools, CAD/CAM programs, etc.

   The manual, which has been completely revised for version 2.2, is
   available with the distribution. It is about 600 pages long. If you
   cannot print out the documentation, they will send you a hardcopy if
   you send a check for US$35 made out to "Carnegie Mellon University" to
   the address given above.

   A number of old articles about Garnet were collected into a CMU
   Technical Report: "The Garnet Compendium: Collected Papers,
   1989-1990" CMU-CS-90-154, August 1990. A new compendium has
   recently been printed including 9 recent papers: "The Second Garnet
   Compendium: Collected Papers, 1990-1992" CMU-CS-93-108, February 1993.
