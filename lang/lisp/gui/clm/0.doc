Name:         CLM, GINA, and IB

Summary:      Common Lisp Motif, Generic INteractive Application, and
              Interface Builder

Version:      2.2, 11-NOV-92

Description: 

   CLM (Common Lisp Motif) runs OSF/Motif widgets in a separate C process,
   with minimal work on the Lisp side and communicates between C and Lisp
   using TCP sockets. When CLX is loaded before compiling CLM, client
   programs can also use the CLX graphics functions to draw into Motif
   widgets, especially into widgets of classes XmDrawingArea and
   XmDrawnButton. 

   GINA (Generic INteractive Application) is an application framework
   based on Common Lisp and OSF/Motif to simplify the construction of
   graphical interactive applications. It is a class library
   implemented in CLOS.

   IB (Interface Builder) is an interactive tool implemented with GINA
   to design Motif windows. It generates Lisp code to be used with GINA.

Requires:     CLM requires OSF/Motif 1.1 or higher. 
              GINA requires CLM and CLX, and CLOS or PCL.

Ports:        CLM runs in Allegro CL, CMU CL, Lucid CL, and Symbolics Genera.  

Origin:       Available free in the X contrib directory or by
              anonymous ftp from either
