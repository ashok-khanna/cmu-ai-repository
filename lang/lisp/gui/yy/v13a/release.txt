----------
Major features of 1.3 version are: 1991/03/18
1. Allegro 4.0 is tested. Genera is updated to 8.0.1
2. Page mode operation is working. Interaction becomes quite faster.
3. Graphic operations / Graphic animation feature (about 10 frame per second)
   are installed.
4. Some widgets for graphic operations are programed.
   They are written as CLOS classes and methods.
5. A simple graphing toy is included in the demo directory.
6. Lots of bugs are fixed.
7. Provisions for the interface with Japanese language front-end
   are installed in YY-server.
8. yygrapher.lisp is included as a simple graphing tool in the yydemo
   directory.
9. Upon initialize-yy, lisp listener comes up.
   (this is only a changing the settings for a sample subwindow arrangement.)
   Also, you may try to get a drawing tool subwindow to test some drawing
   widgets of YYonX by typing a form to invoke it.

----------
Major features of 1.2 version are:  1990/11/15
1. YY-client is tested with Lucid 4.0 (Lucid CLOS), Allegro 3.1.13 (PCL), 
   Allegro 3.1.17 (International version, PCL), and Symbolics Genera 8.0
   (Symbolics CLOS).
   YY-server is mainly tested on Sun4 SunOS4.1 and X11R4.
   (And is working on several other UN*X and/or X11R3 like titan.)
2. Updated YY-server to cope with new features.
3. Updated YY-Protocol (between YY-server and YY-client) specification
   with the introduction of the page mode (for text oriented interaction)
   and viewport mode (for high speed graphic outputs).
4. Event processing, popup menu and several primitives are refined.
5. Many bug fixes and improvements of 1.11alpha.

Further schedule:
0. Refinement of YYAPI specification.
   (Yes, we had not made enthusiastic efforts on improving API specification
   yet, since we like to adopt standards for external interfaces and
   had not enough time to take care of outlooks.)
1. More enhancements on Graphics, animation area.
2. UI tools enhancements.
3. Versions for mainframe Common Lisps are under development.
4. UK researchers told us that the Eulisp is running on top of YY.
   We will welcome such experimentation.
5. Attempt to start the discussion with CLIM to have an unified 
   external specification. (YY and CLIM made a joint statement for it
   on 1990/02/14.)
6. Continuous trial to obtain much higher performance on the
   communication between YY-client process and YY-server process.
