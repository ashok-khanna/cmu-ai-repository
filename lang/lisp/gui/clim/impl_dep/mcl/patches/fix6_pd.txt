README for Patch-006-pane-death.lisp.

CLIM patch 006 corresponds to the patch sometimes referred
to as "premature-pane-death-patch."  It fixes a problem
in which over-aggressive checking for "dead" panes (i.e.,
those whose MCL windows have been closed) caught newly-created
panes which have not yet been displayed.
