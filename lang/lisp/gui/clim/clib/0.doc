Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clim/clib/

Name:         CLIB

Summary:      CLIM Interface Builder

Version:      

Description: 

   Prototype implementation of CLIB, the CLIM Interface Builder.  CLIB
   allows the programmer to generate code for CLIM (the Common Lisp
   Interface Manager) interactively. This speeds up the development
   process and reduces the possibility of errors. This kind of
   interactive rapid prototyping can significantly reduce the costs of a
   specification phase.

   A prototype of a CLIM Interface Builder is being developed within a joint
   effort of Forschungszentrum Informatik (FZI) and Symbolics Systemhaus GmbH.

   Contents include a postscript tech report describing the
   preliminary version of CLIB, and binaries for the Allegro implementation.
