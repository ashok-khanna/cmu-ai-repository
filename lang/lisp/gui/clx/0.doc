Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clx/

Name:         CLX

Summary:      Common Lisp X binding

Version:      R6 (17-APR-94); R5.02 (3-SEP-92)

Description: 

   CLX provides basic Common Lisp/X functionality. It is a de facto standard
   low-level interface to X, providing equivalent functionality to XLib, but
   in Lisp. It is also a good source for comparing the foreign function calls
   in various Lisps. It does *not* depend on CLOS.  

   [Note: The R6 version is clearly different from the R5 version, and
   it is distributed with X11R6, so we're just going to assume that it
   is indeed the R6 version of CLX.]
