BOOK DESCRIPTION

In this greatly expanded edition of the defacto standard, you'll learn
about the nearly 200 changes already made since original publication -
and find out about gray areas likely to be revised later.  Written by
the Vice-Chairman of X3J13 (the ANSI committee responsible for the
standardization of Common Lisp) and co-developer of the language
itself, the new edition contains the entire text of the first edition
plus six completely new chapters.  They cover:

*       CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, with new features to
 support function overloading and object-oriented programming, plus
 complete technical specifications
*       Loops, a powerful control structure for multiple variables
*       Conditions, a generalization of the error signaling mechanism
*       Series and generators
*       Plus other subjects not part of the ANSI standards but of
 interest to professional programmers.  Throughout, you'll find 
 fresh examples, additional clarifications, warnings, and tips - 
 all presented with the author's customary vigor and wit.
