BOOK DESCRIPTION

In this greatly expanded edition of the defacto standard, you'll learn
about the nearly 200 changes already made since original publication -
and find out about gray areas likely to be revised later.  Written by
the Vice-Chairman of X3J13 (the ANSI committee responsible for the
standardization of Common Lisp) and co-developer of the language
itself, the new edition contains the entire text of the first edition
plus six completely new chapters.  They cover:

*	CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, with new features to
        support function overloading and object-oriented programming, plus
        complete technical specifications
*	Loops, a powerful control structure for multiple variables
*	Conditions, a generalization of the error signaling mechanism
*	Series and generators
*	Plus other subjects not part of the ANSI standards but of
        interest to professional programmers.  Throughout, you'll find fresh
        examples, additional clarifications, warnings, and tips - all
        presented with the author's customary vigor and wit.
