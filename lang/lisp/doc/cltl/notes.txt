BOOK DESCRIPTION

In this greatly expanded edition of the defacto standard, you'll learn
about the nearly 200 changes already made since original publication -
and find out about gray areas likely to be revised later.  Written by
the Vice-Chairman of X3J13 (the ANSI committee responsible for the
standardization of Common Lisp) and co-developer of the language
itself, the new edition contains the entire text of the first edition
plus six completely new chapters.  They cover:

*       CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, with new features to
        support function overloading and object-oriented programming, plus
        complete technical specifications
*       Loops, a powerful control structure for multiple variables
*       Conditions, a generalization of the error signaling mechanism
*       Series and generators
*       Plus other subjects not part of the ANSI standards but of
        interest to professional programmers.  Throughout, you'll find fresh
        examples, additional clarifications, warnings, and tips - all
        presented with the author's customary vigor and wit.

I tried, using latex2html. The result is:

http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~alison/clm/clm.html

Code fragements and section references are missing,
probably because I didnt latex it first. If someone
manages to latex it, then creating the HTML files is
very easy, but takes a long time and a machine with a
reasonable amount of memory!

   I'm not able to latex the book because a macro called \ifchiron is
   undefined.  Does anybody know what this is?

   (I've already done my duty and bought a copy of CLtL2---I want an
   online copy as well.)

My guess is that it refers to Chiron, which as I recall is a company in
Cambridge that creates printing masters from tex or dvi or ps files.
Therefore, unless you want to print on a 1000dpi device (or the like) you
can probably comment out whatever \ifchiron inserts.  I have not, however,
tried to run tex on the manual, so this is pure speculation.

Guy Steele sent me the following patch for the "chiron" problem:

    \newif\ifchiron \chironfalse

That indeed stopped the "chiron" complaint, but led to the next series:

No file frontmatter.aux.
No file intro.aux.
... etc. ...

! Undefined control sequence.
\startmargin ->\PostScriptFile 
                               {BlackBars.ps}

If you know TeX/LaTeX (I don't) and would like to help get the CLtL2 
sources back in shape, send me email.  I think it would be great 
to have it online in a variety of formats.  I can do the PostScript 
and Acrobat/PDF work here; HTML and other wizards are also invited 
to participate.

This complaint is due to an \includeonly{series} in clm.tex which needs to
be commented out with a preceding percent sign.

Change : \includeonly{series} to %\includeonly{...}

This error relates to a missing macro to include postscript-code. The
normal way to do this is thru something like psfig. Unfortunately this
won't work here as there is no bounding box defined for the figure.

The easy solution for the BlackBars.ps and WhiteBars.ps errors is to
redefine a macro in marginal.tex file.

---
Change this :

\def\@WhiteBars{\PostScriptFile{WhiteBars.ps}}
\def\@BlackBars{\PostScriptFile{BlackBars.ps}}

to this :

\def\@WhiteBars{}
\def\@BlackBars{}
---

There are also a few postscript files that are missing. They will create
the same sort of error. These are :

#1-plot.ps 
series-plot.ps
ArrowRight.ps
ArrowDown.ps 
ArrowRightSmall.ps

I have found no solution/substitute for the following ps files:
#1-plot.ps 
series-plot.ps

Whenever latex complains about these, you can either press return until you
pass them, or do the following :

--- In number.tex-
Change this :
\def\numplot#1{\vskip -2pt \vskip 28pc \PostScriptFile{#1-plot.ps}\vskip 3pt}

to this:
\def\numplot#1{\vskip -2pt \vskip 28pc \vskip 3pt}
------------------

--- In series.tex-
Change this : 
\PostScriptFile{series-plot.ps}\relax

to this:
%\PostScriptFile{series-plot.ps}\relax
------------------

For the remaining three (ArrowRight.ps,ArrowDown.ps, ArrowRightSmall.ps)
there is an easy but probably inadequate solution. Doing these
substitutions within the CLTL.sty will "fix" it.

Change from this:

\def\Xarrowright{\ifdim 1em<5pt\relax
                       \PostScriptFile{ArrowRightSmall.ps}\else
                       \PostScriptFile{ArrowRight.ps}\fi~}
\def\Xarrowdown{\ifdim 1em<5pt\relax
                      \PostScriptFile{ArrowDownSmall.ps}\else
                      \PostScriptFile{ArrowDown.ps}\fi~}

to this:

\def\Xarrowright{\begin{math} \Rightarrow \end{math}}
\def\Xarrowdown{\begin{math} \Downarrow \end{math}}


There are also two other problems, one is a reference to fonts within
cmtt10 & 12 which doesn't seem to exist (the final document lacks quite a
few hyphens etc.). This may very well be a local problem with the way latex
is set up. The other problem is an undefined control sequence which you can
get past by pressing return once.

---
! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \cleartabs 
---

I have no idea what it does as my TeX/LaTex knowledge is rather thin,
mostly on the survival level. I figured the above things out through some
fiddling back and forth.

If you try to generate the document, remember to run latex at least three
times to get the references correct.

I am still working on getting a better result (mostly with the missing
hyphens). If you have any hints please email me.

Hi again, here is patch/fix you can use to latex the CLtL manual.
----------------------------------------------------------------

<References from previous posts deleted>

After my previous post on how to build the CLtL manual, I received a mail
from Johann Petrak who suggested how to define PostScriptFile. This was a
much better solution than my own.

I took another look at the missing characters latex was complaining about,
and found the problem and a solution. The manual uses some extended
character set, which I at least, don't have/use. The ifchiron macro that
was causing the problems earlier ended up being a fix this time. I used the
chiron character codes instead of the extended characterset that was
originally used.

Below is a series of diffs that can be used to patch up the CLtL LaTeX
sources, so that the manual may be built properly. The only real deficiency
that I know of, is that the sources lack some of the postscript files
referenced in the document.

All the patching done to CLTL.sty related to \char can be ommited if you
can run latex without any complains about missing characters in
fonts. (Have a look in your log file)

If you use the PostScripFile fix you will need to use `dvips', or something
like that, to convert to PostScript before viewing/printing.

The other patches are (brief desc) : 
-commented out the \includeonly{series} from clm.tex 
-commented out the \cleartabs from clos.tex 
-added the "\newif\ifchiron chironfalse" to CLTL.sty
(Suggested by Jim Meehan/Guy Steele) 
-added the "\def\PostScriptFile#1{\special{psfile=#1}}"
(Suggested by Johann Petrak)
-changed the Xarrow{right,down} stuff in CLTL.sty
(Is there a more appropriate fix).  
-changed "\textheight" and "\textwidth" to accomodate A4 in a better way.

The lacking postscript files are :

identity-plot.ps
exp-plot.ps
minus-over-plus-plot.ps
sin-plot.ps
cos-plot.ps
tan-plot.ps
sinh-plot.ps
cosh-plot.ps
tanh-plot.ps
sqrt-one-minus-sq-plot.ps
series-plot.ps

In order to run `dvips' without errors you will have to create empty files
with these names.

Thanks to the efforts of several people, I've been able to update
the sources to CLTL (Common Lisp, the Language, 2nd ed, by Guy Steele)
These are available for anonymous ftp from cambridge.apple.com:/pub/CLTL/

I've added two new subdirectories:

 dvi-ps/   containing the postscript and dvi versions of the book
           Note: these are missing the PS figures that show the 
           branch cuts for the trancendental functions.
           Thanks to Brent Benson
