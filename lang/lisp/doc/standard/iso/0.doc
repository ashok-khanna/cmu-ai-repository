Summary:      Committee Draft Standard for ISO Lisp

Version:      11.4 (1-AUG-94)

Description: 

   The international working group on Lisp is ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG16.
   Christian Queinnec (Christian.Queinnec@inria.fr) is the WG16 Convenor.
   Kent Pitman (kmp@harlequin.com) is the International Representative of
   X3J13 to WG16 and is also Project Editor for WG16. WG16 is working on
   the design of a dialect of Lisp called ISLISP (which is neither a 
   subset nor a superset of Common Lisp).  A Committee Draft (CD) of
   the ISLISP specification has been registered by WG16 as ``CD13816: 
   Information Technology - Programming languages, their environments and
   system software interfaces - Programming language ISLISP.''  The CD, 
   which WG16 internally refers to as version 11.4, is include in this
   directory. 

   A WG16 letter ballot is presently in progress to determine whether
   this Committee Draft will become a Draft International Standard (DIS);
   the ballot closes 30-Nov-94.
