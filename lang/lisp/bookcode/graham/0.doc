Summary:      Code from Paul Graham's "On Lisp" book

Version:      31-OCT-93

Description: 

   This directory contains source code from 
      Paul Graham
      "On Lisp: Advanced Techniques for Common Lisp"
      Prentice Hall, Englewood Clifs, NJ, 1994. 
      400 pages, ISBN 0-13-030552-9.
   The code was mechanically extracted from the TeX source files for
   the book.

   The book emphasizes a bottom-up style of writing programs, which
   Graham claims is natural in Lisp and has advantages over the
   traditional way of writing programs in C and Pascal.

   Of special note are the in-depth sections on writing macros. There are
   several very nice examples. It also includes an implementation of
   Prolog and an ATN compiler.
