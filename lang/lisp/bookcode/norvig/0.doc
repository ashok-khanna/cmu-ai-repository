Summary:      Code from Peter Norvig's Lisp book

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains source code for
      Peter Norvig, "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming:
      Case Studies in Common Lisp", Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc.,
      1992. 946 pages. ISBN 1-55860-191-0. 

   Norvig's book provides an in-depth exposition of advanced AI
   programming techniques and includes large-scale detailed examples. The
   book is the most advanced AI/Common-Lisp programming text and
   reference currently available, and hence is not for the complete
   novice.  It focuses on the programming techniques necessary for
   building large AI systems, including object-oriented programming, and
   has a strong performance orientation.

   The text is marked by its use of "non-toy" examples to illustrate the
   techniques. All of the examples are written in Common Lisp, and copies
   of the source code are available in this directory.  Some of the
   techniques described include rule-based pattern matching (GPS, Eliza,
   a subset of Macsyma, the Emycin expert system shell), constraint
   propagation and backtracking (Waltz line-labeling), alpha-beta search
   (Othello), natural language processing (top-down, bottom-up and chart
   parsing), logic-programming (unification and Prolog), interpreters and
   compilers for Scheme, and object-oriented programming (CLOS).

   The examples are also used to illustrate good programming style and
   efficiency. There is a guide to trouble-shooting and debugging Lisp
   programs, a style guide, and a discussion of portability problems.
   Some of the efficiency techniques described include memoization,
   data indexing, compilation, delaying computation, proper use of
   declarations, avoiding garbage collection, and choosing and using the
   correct data structure.

   The book also serves as an advanced introduction to Common Lisp, with
   sections on the Loop macro, CLOS and sequences, and some coverage of 
   error handling, series, and the package facility.
