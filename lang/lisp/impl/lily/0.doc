Name:         LILY

Summary:      C++ Class Library for writing Lisp-style C++ code

Version:      0.1 (November 1993)

Description: 

   Lily (LIsp LibrarY) is a C++ class library that lets C++ programmers
   write LISP-style code. Includes some example programs from Winston's
   Lisp book recoded in Lily. Most or all of chapters 17 (Symbolic
   Pattern Matching), 18 (Expert Problem Solving), and 23 (Lisp in Lisp)
   are implemented in the examples.

   This package is mainly useful in academia for instructors who wish
   to teach AI techniques in C++. The garbage collection mechanism is
   rather slow, making it unattractive for industrial use.

Requires:     GNU G++ (2.4.5 or later) or Turbo C++ for Windows.
