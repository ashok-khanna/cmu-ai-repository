Some recent developments will have a significant impact on the future of
CMU Common Lisp.  

The CMU CL development has been funded for many years by DARPA.
Technically, it was bundled into CMU's contract for development of Mach and
related software.  That contract ended last April, and the people at DARPA
indicated very little enthusiasm for supporting any further CMU CL
development beyond this point.  Whatever the future role of Common Lisp may
be in the software world, it is no longer viewed as a hot area of research.

So, as of last April, the CMU Common Lisp project no longer exists, as
such.  However, the group is still together and we are starting work on an
exciting new project, also funded by (D)ARPA.  This project is called
"Igor", and the goal is to develop an innovative new software development
environment, based on a high-quality implementation of the new Dylan
language.  I'll say more about the Igor project in a later message.

Because a lot of people depend on our code, and because we will be using
CMU CL as a cross-development vehicle for Igor, we don't plan to drop all
support for it.  However, this is now a side-show for us, so support will
not be at the same level as before.  We will soon be releasing the
17-series core, which will fix a number of bugs and bring the released
version more or less up to date with all our latest changes and fixes.  We
will continue to keep CMU CL running for another couple of years, at least,
and we will port it to some additional machines and operating systems that
we need for our Igor work.  But we probably will not be adding any major
new features that we do not need for our Igor work.  In addition, we may be
reluctant to fix obscure Common Lisp bugs that, in our opinion, are not
hurting real users.  We expect that when the smoke clears on the X3J13
standard, there will be lots of little details to fix up in CMU CL, and
some of those fixes may get a very low priority.

Our CMU CL sources will continue to be freely available, so users who
become impatient with the pace of our bug-fixing may be able to fix things
themselves.  If such fixes are sent back to us, and if we believe they will
not cause other problems, we will incorporate them.

We are sorry if these changes hurt our existing user base, but we are
excited about our new Dylan-based project.  In any case, continuing CMU CL
as before was not an option without ARPA or industrial support, and the
current plan is preferable to dropping CMU CL support completely.
