Summary:      BBN Butterfly Common Lisp and BBN Butterfly Scheme

Version:      2.00 (6-APR-90); 4-FEB-93

Description: 

   This directory contains the sources and binaries for BBN Butterfly
   Common Lisp and BBN Butterfly Scheme.  These programs have been
   publicly released by BBN for the use of the programming community.
   This software is unlikely to run on any machine other than the
   butterfly without significant work; but it might make a good starting
   point for a free implementation of Common Lisp.

   The file "bbn-cl.tv" is a listing of the tar file's contents.
