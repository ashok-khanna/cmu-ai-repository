Name:         WCL

Summary:      Wade's CL, a shared library implementation of Common Lisp

Version:      2.2 (15-JUL-94); 2.14

Description: 

   WCL is an implementation of Common Lisp for Sparc based workstations. WCL
   provides a large subset of Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that
   can be linked with Lisp and C code to produce efficient and small
   applications. For example, the executable for a Lisp version of the
   canonical ``Hello World!'' program requires only 40k bytes under
   SunOS 4.1 for SPARC. WCL provides CLX R5 as a shared library, and
   comes with PCL and a few other utilities.  

   The binary for wgdb is included in the sunos4 binary distribution.

Requires:     Sparc; Solaris or SunOS 4.
              Any version of GCC 2.x may be used with WCL 2.2.
              Version 2.14 of WCL requires GCC 2.1 (2.2.2 doesn't work)
