Summary:      Tutorial for CM5 *Lisp

Version:      23-JAN-94

Description: 

   The "CM5 *Lisp tutorial" in Andrew "ez" and PostScript formats.
   It is aimed at students who don't have an earlier exposure to Lisp.

   *Lisp examples used in the tutorial are a simple Laplace solver combined
   with *Graphics, and a somewhat more complicated Particle in Cell code. 
   The latter is based on using segmented scans and the router rather than 
   on NEWS operations.
