Summary:      Free implementation of Common Lisp for Windows

Description: 

   Allegro CL 3.0 Web Version for Windows is a fully functional and free
   version of Franz's Dynamic Object Oriented Programming Development System
   for ANSI standard CLOS, with some limitations.  

   This version includes an in-core native 32-bit compiler, a drag &
   drop Interface Builder, full debugging and development tools and an
   editor. 

   The limitations are: limited heap size, no foreign function support,
   missing compile-file, missing disassembler and missing save-image.
   The documentation fully explains these capabilities.

   The Web Version is unsupported. Franz sells a supported version of
   this software, Allegro CL for Windows, without these limitations.
