This is CLISP, a Common Lisp implementation.

CLISP is mostly CLtL1 compliant, with some CLtL2 additions, including a
CLOS subset. Many features of CLtL2 or dpANS CL are currently not supported.

The newest versions will always be available via anonymous ftp from
ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de [129.13.115.2], directory /pub/lisp/clisp/.
Another ftp site carrying CLISP is
ftp.cs.cmu.edu [128.2.206.173], directory user/ai/lang/lisp/impl/clisp/.

There is a mailing list for users of CLISP. It is the proper forum for
questions about CLISP, installation problems, bug reports, application
packages etc.
For information about the list and how to subscribe it, send mail to
listserv@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de, with the two lines
          help
          information clisp-list
in the message body.

                        Common Lisp CLISP

Common Lisp is
  * a convential programming language and an AI language
  * interactive
  * a Lisp for professional use

Common Lisp programs are
  * easy to test (interactive)
  * easy to maintain (depending on programming style)
  * portable (there is a standard for the language and the library functions)

Our Common Lisp CLISP
  * needs only 1.5 MB of memory
  * implements 99% of the CLtL1 standard, as well as some extensions
  * can call your preferred editor
  * is freely distributable

Common Lisp provides
  * clear syntax, carefully designed semantics
  * several data types: numbers, strings, arrays, lists, characters, symbols,
    structures, streams etc.
  * runtime typing: the programmer needn't bother about type declarations,
    but he gets notified on type violations.
  * many generic functions:
    88 arithmetic functions for all kinds of numbers (integers, ratios,
    floating point numbers, complex numbers),
    44 search/filter/sort functions for lists, arrays and strings
  * automatic memory management (garbage collection)
  * packaging of programs into modules
  * an object system, generic functions with powerful method combination
  * macros: every programmer can make his own language extensions

Our Common Lisp CLISP provides
  * an interpreter
  * a compiler which makes execution of programs 5 times faster
  * all data types with unlimited size (the size need never be declared,
    the size of lists and arrays may be changed dynamically)
  * integers of arbitrary length, unlimited floating point number precision
  * 594 library functions, 542 of them written in C
