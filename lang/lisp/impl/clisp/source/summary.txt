   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) implementation by
   Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich
   University, both in Germany.  It runs on microcomputers (DOS, OS/2,
   Atari ST, Amiga 500-4000) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, Sun4,
   Sun386, HP9000/800, SGI, Sun3 and others) and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM.
   It is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL.
   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler, a subset of CLOS and, for some
   machines, a screen editor. Packages running in CLISP include PCL and,
   on Unix machines, CLX and Garnet.  Available by anonymous ftp from
   ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de [129.13.115.2] in the directory
   /pub/lisp/clisp.  For more information, contact marcus@ee.pdx.edu.
