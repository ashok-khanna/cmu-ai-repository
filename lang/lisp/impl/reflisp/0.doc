Summary:      Reference-counting Lisp Interpreter

Version:      2.67 (27-FEB-93)

Description: 

   RefLisp is a small Lisp interpreter. Versions exist for MS-DOS and
   UNIX (AIX). The MS-DOS version supports CGA/EGA/VGA graphics and the
   Microsoft Mouse. The interpreter is a shallow-binding (i.e.,
   everything has dynamic scope), reference counting design making it
   suitable for experimenting with real-time and graphic user interface
   programming. Common Lisp compatibility macros are provided, and most
   of the examples in "Lisp" by Winston & Horn have been run on RefLisp.
   RefLisp makes no distinction between symbol-values and
   function-values, so a symbol can be either but not both.  RefLisp
   comes with an ASCII manual and many demonstration programs, including
   an analogue clock which never stops for garbage collection.  There is
   also a program profiler.
