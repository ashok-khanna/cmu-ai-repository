<H2>KCL: Kyoto Common Lisp</H2>

Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is a highly portable and implementation of
Common Lisp originally developed at Kyoto University in Japan. KCL
conforms to CLtL1.  Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) is a collection of
ports, bug fixes and improvements to KCL written by Bill Schelter.
{A}KCL generates C code which it compiles with the local C compiler.

It is recommended that you use AKCL and not try to compile KCL, since
KCL is unlikely to work with current operating systems.

Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax
512-258-1342, E-mail guthery@acw.com, including a CLOS for AKCL. 

Ibuki Common Lisp is a commercialized and improved version of Kyoto
Common Lisp. It runs on over 30 platforms, including Sun3, Sparc, Dec
(Ultrix), Apollo, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, Silicon Graphics and IBM PCs.
It includes an incremental compiler, interpreter, foreign function
interface. It generates C code from the Lisp and compiles it using the
local C compiler.  Image size is about 3mb. Cost is $2800
(workstations), $3500 (servers), $700 (IBM PCs). Supports CLOS and CLX
($200 extra).  Source code is available at twice the cost. Ibuki now
also has a product called CONS which compiles Lisp functions into
linkable Unix libraries.  Write to: Ibuki Inc., PO Box 1627, Los
Altos, CA 94022, or call 415-961-4996, fax 415-961-8016, or send email
to Richard Weyhrauch, rww@ibuki.com or support@ibuki.com.

The X-Windows interface for AKCL is in the file xakcl-1.tar.gz and
includes the dwindow interface, which is built on top of XAKCL. XAKCL
was written by Hiep Huu Nguyen and dwindow by Gordon Novak
<novak@cs.utexas.edu>.

The directory structure is as follows:
  kcl/     KCL release, including the license.txt file and the KCL Report
  akcl/    The AKCL release, including the dos beta version, 
           the NeXT version, PCL, CLX, and XAKCL
  kcl.faq  The KCL Frequently Asked Questions file.

Version:      KCL (10-JUN-87); AKCL 1-615 (28-APR-92)

Requires:     C

Ports:        AKCL runs on Sparc, IBM RT, RS/6000, DecStation 3100, hp300,
              hp800, Macintosh II (under AUX), mp386, IBM PS2, IBM RT_AIX,
              Silicon Graphics 4d, Sun3, Sun4, Sequent Symmetry, IBM 370,
              NeXT and Vax. DOS is in beta test.

Copying:      KCL is free, but requires a license. KCL is *NOT* in the
              public domain. You must sign and mail in a copy of the license
              agreement before using it. Send the license agreement to:
                 Special Interest Group in LISP
                 c/o Taiichi Yuasa
                 Department of Computer Science
                 Toyohashi University of Technology
                 Toyohashi 441, JAPAN
              You must send in the license agreement even if you're
              using AKCL, since AKCL incorporates KCL.
