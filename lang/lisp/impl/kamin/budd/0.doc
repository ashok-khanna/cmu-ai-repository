Summary:      Tim Budd's C++ Implementation of the Kamin Interpreters

Version:      11-SEP-91

Description: 

   This directory contains Tim Budd's implementation in C++ of the
   interpreters discussed in Kamin's book, including Pascal, Lisp, APL,
   Scheme, SASL, CLU, Smalltalk and Prolog. The implementations center
   around a common core that remains unchanged from language to language.

   Tim Budd's implementation represents a complete rewrite,
   not a translation of Kamin's Pascal versions.

Requires:     GNU C++ 1.39
