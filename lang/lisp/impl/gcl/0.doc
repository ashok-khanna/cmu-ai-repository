Package:      lang/lisp/impl/gcl/

Name:         GCL

Summary:      GNU Common Lisp

Version:      2.1 (7-MAY-95); 2.0 (10-APR-95); 1.0 (10-MAY-94)

Description: 

   GNU Common Lisp (GCL) is a highly portable implementation of
   Common Lisp originally based on Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL), a
   Common Lisp (CLtL1) implementation developed at Kyoto University in
   Japan and extended by Bill Schelter of UT/Austin. GCL is intended
   to eventually support the ANSI Standard for Common Lisp. GCL
   generates C code which it compiles with the local optimizing C
   compiler (e.g., GCC).

   GCL has a source level debugger for interpreted code, profiling
   tools based on the C profiling tools, and supports CLX, and PCL.

   Versions 1.0 and above of GCL (aka versions 1-625 and above of
   AKCL) no longer require the kcl.tar file, and are covered by the
   GNU General Public Library License. 

   Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
   11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax
   512-258-1342, E-mail guthery@acw.com, including a CLOS for AKCL. 

   Ibuki Common Lisp is a commercialized and improved version of Kyoto
   Common Lisp. It runs on over 30 platforms, including Sun3, Sparc, Dec
   (Ultrix), Apollo, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, Silicon Graphics and IBM PCs.
   It includes an incremental compiler, interpreter, foreign function
   interface. It generates C code from the Lisp and compiles it using the
   local C compiler.  Image size is about 3mb. Cost is $2800
   (workstations), $3500 (servers), $700 (IBM PCs). Supports CLOS and CLX
   ($200 extra).  Source code is available at twice the cost. Ibuki now
   also has a product called CONS which compiles Lisp functions into
   linkable Unix libraries.  Write to: Ibuki Inc., PO Box 1627, Los
   Altos, CA 94022, or call 415-961-4996, fax 415-961-8016, or send email
   to Richard Weyhrauch, rww@ibuki.com or support@ibuki.com.

   The X-Windows interface for AKCL is in the file xakcl-1.tar.gz and
   includes the dwindow interface, which is built on top of XAKCL. XAKCL
   was written by Hiep Huu Nguyen and dwindow by Gordon Novak
   <novak@cs.utexas.edu>.
