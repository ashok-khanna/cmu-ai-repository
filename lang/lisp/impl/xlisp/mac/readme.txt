XLisp 2.1e is now available for the Macintosh.

There are two files available here for downloading; they should appear
on sumex.stanford.edu, mac.archive.umich.edu, and other sites soon.

One (xlisp.hqx) contains the XLisp executable, documentation, and
sample code.  It provides all the functionality of XLisp 2.1e with an
interface similar to that of Apple's MCL -- it is not as powerful as
MCL, but it is a lot cheaper (free) and less disk-greedy.  It should
be completely compatible with XLisp code written on other platforms.

The other (xlispsrc.hqx) contains the complete source code to the
application, along with a THINK C v6 project file.  Note that it does
not contain the complete xlisp distribution code; files for compiling
it on other operating systems have been left out.  You can ftp the
latest complete xlisp distribution (with code for Unix, Amiga, and DOS
platforms) from glia.biostr.washington.edu.

Like XLisp on other platforms, this program is in the public domain.
The source code to the xlisp engine is completely unchanged from the
code used on other platforms.
