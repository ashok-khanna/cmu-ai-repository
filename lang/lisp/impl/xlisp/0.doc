Package:      lang/lisp/impl/xlisp/

Name:         XLISP

Summary:      XLISP programming language

Version:      2.1g* (2-SEP-94); 2.1e3; 2.1g bc (bytecode version)

Description: 

   XLISP 2.0 is an experimental programming language written by David Betz
   combining some of the features of LISP with an object-oriented
   extension capability. Tom Almy extended XLISP to bring it into closer
   conformance with Common Lisp (version 2.1g*).

   Version 2.1g* was received direct from Tom Almy.

   Files include:
      ufg.arc       Universal game playing functions for XLISP
      xmath.arc     X-Lisp math functions to accompany X-Lisp

Requires:     C compiler

Ports:        IBM PC (MSDOS), Amiga (AmigaDOS), Atari ST (TOS), Apple Macintosh

Origin:       Version 2.0 is available by anonymous ftp from
                 cs.orst.edu:/pub/xlisp/ [128.193.32.1] or
                 sumex-aim.stanford.edu:info-mac/dev/

              Version 2.1 is the same as XLISP 2.0, but modified to
              bring it closer to Common Lisp and with several bugs
              fixed. It can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
                 glia.biostr.washington.edu:/pub/xlisp      128.95.10.115
                 wasp.eng.ufl.edu:/pub                      128.227.116.1
              as the files xlisp21e.zip and xlisp21e.tar.Z. The xlisp21e.zip 
              file comes with IBM/PC executables.

              A Macintosh port of version 2.1e (and the C source code
              to its interface) is also available, from Macintosh 
              ftp sites such as
                 sumex.stanford.edu:/info-mac/dev/xlisp-21e2.hqx
                 mac.archive.umich.edu:/mac/development/languages/xlisp2.1e2.sit.hqx

              A version of XLISP-PLUS 2.1g that includes an experimental
              byte code compiler is available by anonymous ftp from
                 umnstat.stat.umn.edu:/pub/xlispstat/xlisponly/ [128.101.51.1]
