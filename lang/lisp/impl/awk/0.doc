Name:         AWK Lisp

Summary:      Lisp implemented in AWK

Version:      23-JUL-90

Description: 

   A Lisp interpreter implemented in Awk.

   It provides intrinsic versions of the basic functions on
   s-expressions, and many others written in LISP.

   The interpreter has thirteen built-in functions: car, cdr, cons, eq,
   atom, set, eval, error, quote, cond, and, or, list.  These include the
   five elementary functions on s-expressions defined by McCarthy; some
   conditional expression operators; an assignment operator, and some
   functions to control the evaluation process.
