Sun Feb  7 19:10:36 1993  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz@lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el(cl-version)
        3.0.

Mon Nov 16 21:08:33 1992  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz@cyan.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el(passim)
        Formatting changes needed for standardization in v19.

Sun Nov  1 22:18:29 1992  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz@cyan.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (cl-version)
        3.0 beta.
        
        Removed the handlers for the old bytecompiler.  Converted to work
        with the version 19 compiler.  (The bugs below were discovered by
        the new compiler.)

        * cl.el (reduce)
        :initial-value needed a defkeyword

        * cl.el (elt-satisfies-if[-not]-p)
        The variable `elt' should have been the argument `item'.  Also, the
        funcall was wrong: it was using `item' twice.

Sat Oct  5 23:45:45 1991  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (defstruct, build$hints$for)
        Now defstruct hints the compiler about inlining the member
        functions.  The accessors should experience a nice speedup.
        The other functions tend to be too trivial and so I expect that
        the new compiler would inline them anyway, or leave them alone if
        no gains are expected.

        The output of build$hints$for is used to implement a suggestion
        of Jamie Zawinski <jwz%thalidomide@lucid.com>.

Sun Sep 15 17:30:33 1991  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lime.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (list*, progv)
        New function and macro, due to Aaron Larson.

        * cl.el (psetq)
        Replaced with version suggested by Hallvard Furuseth.

        * cl.el (various)
        Added speedups from Rob Austein.

Sat Oct 27 22:19:39 1990  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at slate.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (mod, rem)
        They now access the representation of multiple value returns
        directly, for a serious speed improvement.

        * cl.el (butlast)
        Stavros Macrakis <macrakis@diderot.gr.osf.org> noticed that
        butlast could use a final nreverse, because the inner reverse
        created a fresh list.

        * cl.el (safe-idiv)
        Removed redundant domain checks; / would likely complain now.
        Tightened the code a bit too.  It is important to speed up integer
        arithmetic, even at the cost of poorer error messages.  This
        function should be implemented in C.

        * cl.el (setnthcdr)
        Recursion hand-replaced by iteration.

Fri Jun  8 20:40:19 1990  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (defstruct)
        The copier function invoked the non-existent copy-vector.  Calling
        copy-sequence does the job.
        Noted by Bruce Cohen (brucec@labs.tek.com).

Sun Dec 17 23:24:41 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at pear.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (defsetf for point)
        Point's inverse is goto-char.  Mentioned by R. Potter.  Of course,
        what do we do with the other basic types of Emacs Lisp?

Thu Dec  7 21:26:19 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (member)
        Another, perhaps counterproductive, speed hack.  When test or
        testnot are symbols (hopefully, non-null), they are replaced by
        their symbol-function slots.  This presumably reduces one
        indirection per each funcall in the inner loop.  
        I got this idea while responding a question from David Stampe
        <stampe@uhccux.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>, about the general obscurity of
        member.

Mon Nov 27 00:43:03 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (byte-compile-named-list-accessors)
        Another byte-compile handler, this one eliminates the extra call
        incurred when using first, ..., tenth, or rest.  This makes those
        list accessors essentially as primitive as car, cdr, or nth.

Wed Nov 15 03:06:49 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (with-keyword-args)
        Macro that simplifies most of the handling of klists.  The only
        neglected functionality is that no supplied-p forms exist
        (although that is true also of lambda lists in Emacs Lisp).
        Suggestion of Robert Potter.

Sat Nov  4 18:08:39 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (cl-eval-print-last-sexp)
        Added half-hearted support for -, +, ++, +++, *, **, ***, /, //,
        ///; and cleared the mvalues mechanism at every call.

Sun Oct 29 00:10:33 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (declare, proclaim, the)
        Old suggestion of phr%widow.Berkeley.EDU@lilac.berkeley.edu, to
        make some more CL codes easy to load.  These are dummies, and have
        no effect whatsoever.  (Perhaps `the' could be made to check in
        the interpreter, and to ignore in the compiler.  Then again,
        writing `typecase' would be also useful and I haven't done it yet.)

        * cl.el (byte-compile-ca*d*r)
        New function, used as a handler from byte-compile-form to
        eliminate the extra call to the c*r functions in compiled code.
        For instance, (defun f1 (x) (cadadr x)) compiles to:

                byte code for f1:
                 args: (x)

                0   varref   x
                1   cdr
                2   car
                3   cdr
                4   car
                5   return

                nil

        * cl.el (adjoin, map)
        Changed to use `memq' instead of `member', too.

        * cl.el (case, ecase)
        Via a change in case-clausify, these macros now generate tests
        using the primitive `memq', instead of the heavier `member'.

        * cl.el (member)
        Rewrote it to exploit the keyword argument machinery.  It also
        tries to call memq whenever possible.

Fri Oct 27 01:21:57 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el
        Two-branch conds changed into simple ifs here and there, minor
        layout changes all over.

        * cl.el (defsetf)
        `Puts' occur in the generated code, not in the macro expander.
        (Didn't we fix this long ago?)

        * cl.el (setf)
        Comment disagreed with the code.  Code was right.

        * cl.el (defkeyword)
        Was dropping the DOCSTRING.

        * cl.el (reduce)
        New function.  Presented as an example of how to use KLISTs to
        parse calls in functions that take keyword arguments.

        * cl.el (concatenate, map)
        New functions.

        * cl.el (extract-from-klist)
        Swapped arguments for convenience.

        * cl.el (keyword-argument-supplied-p, cl$subseq-as-list)
        New auxiliary functions.

        * cl.el (build-klist)
        Better error messages.

Thu Oct  5 14:27:12 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at slate.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (psetf)
        Rewrote, patterned after the new psetq.

        * cl.el (psetq)
        Added early check for even number of arguments.  This causes a
        better error message than previously.

Wed Oct  4 21:34:44 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (cl-version)
        "2.0 beta" installed in Rochester, offered for ftp.

        * cl.el (defstruct, parse$defstruct$options)
        asp@CS.CMU.EDU (James Aspnes) reported that defstruct wasn't
        handling properly the use of accessors of an :included definition
        applied to instances of the :including structure.  Indeed, the old
        version was implementing a (rather useless) sense of
        multiple-inheritance that was inimical to the Common Lisp sense.
        Fixed here by adding properties :structure-includes and
        :structure-included-in to the struct name.  They keep track of the
        graph of inclusions.

Sun Oct  1 23:13:11 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (mapc, maplist, mapl, mapcan, mapcon)
        * cl.el (copy-list, copy-tree, revappend, nreconc, nbutlast)
        * cl.el (subst, subst-if, subst-if-not, sublis)
        * cl.el (member-if, member-if-not, tailp)
        New functions, developed apart and now merged with the main file.
        They still don't take :keyword arguments.

Mon Sep 18 10:41:14 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at lemon.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (safe-idiv)
        The signum calculation overflowed at times. Better expression was
        suggested by mad@math.keio.JUNET (MAEDA Atusi), in connection
        with getris.el

        * cl.el (psetq)
        A better definition, suggested by comparison with macroexpansions
        observed in several other lisps (Zeta, Xerox Common and Interlisp,
        TI).

Tue Aug 29 17:06:36 1989  Cesar Quiroz  (quiroz at ash.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (floor, ceiling, truncate)
        Jeff Peck (peck@sun.com) noticed bugs in FLOOR when dealing with
        negatives.  Similar bugs affected ceiling and truncate.

        * cl.el (cl-eval-print-last-sexp)
        New function, of use mainly to developers/maintainers of cl.el.
        Can replace eval-print-last-sexp in lisp-interaction-mode, so that
        multiple values are reported (almost) correctly.  Do not
        advertise.

Sun May 21 14:27:22 1989  Cesar Quiroz (quiroz at lesath.cs.rochester.edu)

        * cl.el (isqrt)
        Philippe Schnoebelen <phs@lifia.imag.fr> suggested a new
        termination condition.  The old one was too conservative, which
        forced special cases for n=0,1,2,3.  The new termination condition
        is simpler, and only n=0 is treated especially.
