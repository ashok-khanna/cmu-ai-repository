XLS is a preliminary minimal version of XLISP-STAT for MSDOS. The only
graphics available are plot-points and plot-lines. There is not much
memory available - whatever you can get out of 640K.

The file xlszip.exe is a self-extracting zip file. To extract the stuff,
type

	xlszip -d

The -d option insures that the directory structure in the zip file is
preserved.

After unpacking this stuff, put the executable, xls.exe, somewhere on
your search path and put the lib directory somewhere convenient. Then
be sure to define an environment variable XLISPLIB with the path of
the directory ENDING WITH A \. So if you put the library in
c:\xlisp\lib, define

set XLISPPIB=c:\xlisp\lib\

Put this in your autoexec.bat or somesuch so it is available whenever
you run xls. Then type xls.
