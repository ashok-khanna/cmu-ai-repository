XLISP-STAT Release 3.37 for UNIX systems is now available for
anonymous ftp from umnstat.stat.umn.edu (128.101.51.1) in

	pub/xlispstat/xlispstat-3-37.tar.gz

This a tar archive compressed with the GNU gzip compression utility.
Once you have retrieved the file you can extract the sources with

	gzip -cd | tar xvf - 

This is a beta realease -- some things are still in flux, others have
not been extensively tested. Please let me know if you run into any
problems.

There are a large number of minor changes, mostly in the basic XLISP
system. These chages move the basic XLISP closer to Common Lisp, and
include

	- Common Lisp package system for name space management

	- multiple return values

	- other improvements from XLISP-PLUS 2.1g

	- a byte code compiler

	- saving workspaces (useful for simplifying startup, not yet
	  for saving data -- workspaces from the current version will
	  not yet work with future versions)

	- support for dynamic loading in more systems (based on shared
	  libraries).

Wherever possible, changes have been made in such a way as to maintain
backward compatiblility, but a few incompatibilities were unavoidable.
The file doc/changes.tex gives a rough overview of the changes.

I have changed the release numbering system to have a major number and
a minor number. The major release number is now 3. The minor number is
37; it continues on from the Alpha numberings. Thus the 3 Alpha 26
release that was made available recently corresponds to 3.26 in the
new scheme. At least one of these numbers will change whenever a new
version is made available publically; this should help in identifying
problems.

Please read the INSTALL file before installing this version. There is
now a configure script that attempts to set up the Makefile
appropriately. The configuration script has been tested on the
following systems:

	Machine			Operating System
	=======			================
	CRAY Y-MP		Cray OS 7.C.3
	EPIX			UMIPS 1.4.3
	DECstation 3100		ULTRIX 4.2
	DEC Alpha		OSF1 V1.3
	HP 9000/715		HP-UX A.09.01
	IBM RS6000		AIX 2.3 (?)
	SGI IndyPC		IRIX 5.2
	Sun Sparc		SunOs 4.1
	Sun Sparc		SunOA 5.3

I believe the configure script will also work for Linux but can't test
that myself. The script may work on other systems or may need
modifications. If you have trouble getting it to run on another
system, or get it to run with some changes, please let me know so I
can make appropriate modifications to the configure script.
