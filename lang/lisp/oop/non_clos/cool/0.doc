Name:         COOL

Summary:      Implementation of HP's CommonObjects on top of the PCL
              metaclass kernel.

Version:      10-MAY-87

Description: 

   COOL is an implementation of HP's CommonObjects on the Portable
   CommonLoops (PCL) metaclass kernel.  As such, it provides a portable
   implementation of CommonObjects. It should be of particular interest
   to people who want to program in the mixin style supported by PCL but
   are also interested in trying the encapsulation style of Smalltalk,
   which CommonObjects supports.

   This version of COOL is guaranteed to work with Portable CommonLoops
   system date 2-24-87. A copy of this version of Portable CommonLoops is
   distributed along with COOL.

              comp.sources.unix, on 16 Sep 87 04:50:50, which fixes
