Name:         CORBIT and BOOPS

Summary:      Object-oriented extension of Common Lisp based on a
              prototype (classless) model of OOP.

Version:      21-JAN-93

Description: 

   CommonORBIT (also called CORBIT) is an object-oriented extension of
   Common Lisp.  It uses a prototype (classless) model of OOP, is easy to
   use and yet has many sophisticated features found also in KL-ONE type
   languages.  CommonORBIT is a Common Lisp reimplementation of ORBIT,
   which was originally conceived by Luc Steels around 1981-1983.
   Because of its delegation-based rather than class-based inheritance,
   CommonORBIT offers extreme flexibility to define and change
   practically anything at run-time.  Because of the generic functions,
   it fits well into regular Lisp code.  It can co-exist with CLOS but
   remains completely separate. 

   BOOPS (Beginner's Object-Oriented Programming System) is a
   stripped-down version of CORBIT.  It is very small,
   efficient and simple and intended for classroom use.

   Documentation (postscript, MSWord, Ascii) is included.
