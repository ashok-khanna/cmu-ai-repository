Summary:      Meta Class System, a portable object-oriented extension 
              to Common Lisp.

Version:      1.3.1 (13-MAY-91); 1.4.1 (16-NOV-92)

Description: 

   MCS (Meta Class System) is a portable object-oriented extension to
   Common Lisp. It integrates the functionality of CLOS (the Common Lisp
   Object System), and TELOS, (the object system of LeLisp Version 16 and
   EuLisp).  MCS provides a metaobject protocol which the user can
   specialize.

   MCS has been used successfully for the development of the commercial
   software product Babylon, an expert system development workbench that
   includes a hybrid knowledge representation language and many tools
   like editors and browsers.

   If you use MCS, send Juergen a short email message, so that you
   will be notified when updates are available.

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs in any valid Common Lisp. Tested in MCL, Allegro CL,
              Lucid CL, TI CL, AKCL, CMU CL.
