Thomas is a compiler written at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge
Research Laboratory.  Thomas compiles a language compatible with the
language described in the book "Dylan(TM) an object-oriented dynamic
language" by Apple Computer Eastern Research and Technology, April 1992;
the file Thomas-1.1/DIFFERENCES lists the known differences.

We have made every effort to minimize the differences between Thomas and
Dylan(TM), and to remove bugs, but help from others would be greatly
appreciated.  The original development team consisted of:

        Matt Birkholz (Birkholz@crl.dec.com)
        Jim Miller (JMiller@crl.dec.com)
        Ron Weiss (RWeiss@crl.dec.com)

In addition, Joel Bartlett (Bartlett@wrl.dec.com), Marc Feeley
(Feeley@iro.umontreal.ca), Guillermo Rozas (Jinx@zurich.ai.mit.edu) and
Ralph Swick (Swick@crl.dec.com) contributed time and energy to the initial
release.

This is the release directory for the Thomas system.  You will find two
items in addition to this file:

1) a directory named Thomas-1.1 which contains all of the source code,
documentation, and kits for all available implementations of Thomas
version 1.1.

2) a file named Thomas-1.1.tar.Z which is a compressed tar file of the
Thomas-1.1 directory.

Please read Thomas-1.1/README for more information.
