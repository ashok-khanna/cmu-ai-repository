Many of you have heard about our plans for a project named Igor, whose goal
is to develop an innovative new software-development environment for the
Dylan language.  We've run into a name conflict with the name "Igor", so
the project and the environment we produce will henceforth be called
"Gwydion".  If you're curious about the meaning of the new name, see the
cmu.cs.common-lisp or comp.lang.dylan newsgroups for the whole story.

A few weeks ago I posted an announcement of the Igor project at Carnegie
Mellon, whose goal is to produce an innovative new software-development
environment based on the Dylan language (and, in the process, to make
available a very high-quality implementation of Dylan).  This project
includes many of the same people who brought you CMU Common Lisp.

Unfortunately, we have run into a name conflict on the name "Igor".  A
company called WaveMetrics in Oregon is marketing a graphing and data
analysis package called "Igor" for the Mac.  After some friendly (no
lawyers) discussion with those folks, we determined that their system and
ours are close enough in what they do that it might cause some real
confusion for both of us to use the same name.  So we have to find a new
name.

Anyone who has tried to name a system or project will appreciate how hard
it is to find a good name that is not already taken, but I think we have
now succeeded: Henceforth, if there are no more nasty surprises, our
environment will be known as "Gwydion", and we will be "the Gwydion
project".

The name Gwydion seems very appropriate for our project:

In Welsh mythology, Gwydion is the uncle (and by some accounts also the
father) of Dylan, who is a sea god and the Spirit of Darkness, and of Llew
Llaw, the Spirit of Light.  Gwydion is a mighty wizard, able to change
shapes at will, and a bard with wonderful ability to recite poetry and
ancient lore.  His most famous magical exploit was to turn a pile of fungus
into twelve greyhounds, twelve stallions, and twelve golden shields --
temporarily -- which he swaps for wonderful new creatures called swine,
just arrived from the underworld.  This trickery starts a big war and gets
Gwydion in trouble with his uncle, named Math, who is an even more powerful
wizard.  Later Gwydion makes many trips to the underworld to retrieve
creatures for the benefit of humanity: the deer, the dog, and the lapwing.

Gwydion is the druid of the gods, which presumably means he looks after
their trees.  He is hostile to the niggardly gods of the underworld who
hoard Fertility, which they keep buried under the earth until he, as
beneficent trickster, uses his warm sunrays to free it.  He is credited
with originating April Fool's Day when, on the first day of April, he
conjured up magical armies to trick his sister Arianrhod.

And so, as you see, Gwydion is an even better name for our project than
Igor would have been.  Thanks to David Pierce, one of my undergrad hackers
and a student of Celtic lore, for coming up with this.

The Gwydion Project at CMU is developing an innovative new software
development environment based on the Dylan language (and, in the
process, will make available a very high-quality implementation of
Dylan). This project includes many of the same people responsible for
CMU Common Lisp. (In Welsh mythology, Gwydion is the uncle of Dylan
and nephew of Math.)
