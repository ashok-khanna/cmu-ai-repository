Summary:      Information about the CMU Gwydion compiler

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a description of the Gwydion Project at
   Carnegie Mellon University. This project is developing an innovative
   new software development environment based on the Dylan language (and,
   in the process, will make available a very high-quality implementation
   of Dylan). This project includes many of the same people responsible
   for CMU Common Lisp.

   In Welsh mythology, Gwydion is the uncle of Dylan and nephew of Math.
