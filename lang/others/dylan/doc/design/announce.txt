In the last few months, we have been working hard to complete the Dylan
language specification.  Nearly all of our language design issues have been
settled, and the Dylan design process is in its final phase. We are excited
to be able to release another group of Design Notes.  

These Design Notes are now available via anonymous ftp from:
        cambridge.apple.com:/pub/dylan/design-notes

All Design Notes are available in plain text and postscript formats.

Design Note #22 is a description of Dylan's new syntax, including the
current BNF.  Note that this syntax is not final (see below).  Design Note
#22 is a formal definition and does not include examples; look in the other
Design Notes for examples.  All of the new Design Notes use Dylan's new
syntax.

We welcome your comments.  Your feedback is very important to us.  At this
point, we are especially interested in comments on the new syntax.  Please
understand that because of the amount of mail we are receiving, we may not
be able to respond to your message in detail.
 
We will release our final set of design notes in March, which will complete
the language specification.  Among other things, this will include a
specification of the Dylan macro system, and the final version of the Dylan
syntax (including changes guided by your feedback).

We look forward to hearing from you.
