Name:         Telos

Summary:      Implementation of the EuLisp Object System

Version:      Telos 3.1 (17-DEC-93); Telosis 1.00f (7-SEP-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains implementations of the EuLisp object system
   in Common Lisp (Telos) and Scheme (Telosis).

Requires:     

Ports:        Feel is known to run on Sun3, Sun4, Stardent Titan, KSR-1,
              Alliant Concentrix 2800, Orion clippers, DEC VAX, HP 730,
              DECstation 3000, Gould UTX/32, and Inmos T800 transputer
              (using CS-Tools). (All bar the last four have a threads
              mechanism.) It can run in multi-process mode on the
              first three machines, and hopefully any other SysV-like
              machine with shared memory primitives. Porting Feel to
              new machines is reasonably straightforward. It now also
              runs on MS-DOS machines.
