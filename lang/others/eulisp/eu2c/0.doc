Name:         Apply/Eu2C

Summary:      EuLisp->C compiler

Version:      94-07 (20-JUL-94)

Description: 

   Apply/Eu2C is an EuLisp->C compiler available from ISST.  Eu2C runs on
   top of Franz Allegro CL 4.1 and compiles EuLisp-Modules into C source
   code which then must be compiled by an ANSI C-compiler (currently only
   GCC is supported).  The Eu2C implementation provides EuLisp 0.99
   level-0, including threads. Future versions of Eu2C
   will include a C interface and straight module compilation. 

   The development of Apply/Eu2C was supported by the German Federal
   Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) within the joint project
   APPLY. The partners of this project are the Christian Albrechts
   University Kiel, the Fraunhofer Institute for Software Engineering and
   Systems Engineering (ISST), the German National Research Center for
   Computer Science(GMD), and VW-Gedas.

   The main goal of APPLY project is to develop a Lisp system which
   consistently supports the efficient execution of applications and
   simplifies their integration into current software environments.
   Towards that end, ISST is investigating strategies for the compilation
   of EuLisp-Modules into efficient stand-alone C-Programs. The Eu2C
   compiler is the first step along this path.
