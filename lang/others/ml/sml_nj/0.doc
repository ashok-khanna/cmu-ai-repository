Name:         Standard ML of New Jersey

Summary:      Free implementation of the Standard ML language.

Version:      SML-NJ 0.93 (16-FEB-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains Standard ML of New Jersey, version 0.93. It
   is the first general public release since version 0.75. 

   The release features support for several new machines (i386, rs6000,
   hppa), less space taken up by compilation and execution, extensive
   documentation, and almost no remaining bugs.

   It includes an extensive library of structures and functions with
   detailed documentation (The Standard ML of New Jersey Library), a
   system for multithreaded concurrent programming in an extension of
   Standard ML with synchronous communication channels (the Concurrent ML
   system, CML), and an elegant concurrent interface to the X Window
   System (eXene).  The eXene system is built on top of Concurrent ML.

   The release also includes several tools written in SML: a separate
   compilation and "make" facility (SourceGroup), a lexical analyzer
   generator (lexgen), a LALR(1) parser generator (mlyacc), a dynamic
   tree pattern matching code generator generator (mltwig), a rudimentary
   tool for querying the SML environment (info), a debugger, and a profiler.

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs on Sun3, Sun4, HP, NeXT, Macintosh (AUX, MacOS),
              DEC (MIPS/Ultrix, MACH), MIPS, SGI IRIX, Sony News, IBM RS6000,
              Sequent I386, Intel 386/486 (BSD/MACH), HP PA (HPUX 8.0).

              A port to Windows NT is planned.
