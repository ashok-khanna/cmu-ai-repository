Package:      lang/prolog/util/ptags/

Name:         PTAGS

Summary:      Creates a tags file from Prolog sources

Version:      5-MAR-89

Description: 

   Ptags creates a tags file for the Prolog predicates as defined in the
   source files supplied as input. Its use is analogous to that of
   ctags(1).  Like ctags, output is sent to a file called tags in the
   current directory.  Each line in the tags file contains three
   tab-separated fields: the first is the name of each predicate defined
   in the source files; the second is the name of the file where the
   predicate is defined; and the third is an instruction to be executed
   by vi(1) or ex(1) to find the definition within the source file.  As
   with ctags, the tags file is sorted alphabetically by predicate name.
