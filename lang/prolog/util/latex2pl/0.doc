Name:         Literate Prolog

Summary:      LaTeX macros for including Prolog code in documents.

Version:      24-FEB-93

Description: 

   Literate Prolog (latex2pl) allows the user to include Prolog code in
   LaTeX documents. The Prolog code is included between \begin{prolog}
   and \end{prolog} commands. These sections are typeset in Courier to
   distinguish them from the surrounding text. The commands
   \begin{prologdisplay} and \end{prologdisplay} are like the verbatim
   environment, except that the text is typeset in Courier Italic to
   identify it as Prolog code that is not necessarily executable. Smaller
   sections of Prolog text can be typeset using the {\pl ...} and 
   {\pli ...} commands, the latter being "Prolog italic".

   The author did not use Web, because the formatting commands are
   cryptic and Prolog doesn't need the same code reordering as Pascal and C.

Requires:     LaTeX

Ports:        Works with any brand of Prolog.
