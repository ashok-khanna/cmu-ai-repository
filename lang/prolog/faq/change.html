IBM Prolog. The IBM SAA AD/Cycle Prolog family consists of products
for both OS/2 2.x and S/370 (VM, MVS (TSO, CICS or IMS)).  IBM Prolog
is a complete implementation of the Prolog language with several
extensions.  Full compatibility exists between the OS/2 and the host
environments, allowing applications developped in one environment to
run on another environment.  IBM SAA AD/Cycle Prolog features an interpreter,
incremental and full compilers, 32-bit mode execution on OS/2 V2,
source-level interactive debugger, interfaces with usual languages (C
and REXX) and ES/2 Database Manager, and an interface to the
Presentation Manager.  The advanced features include delayed
evaluation, global terms, extended data types (big integers and
rationals, items, arrays, user-defined types), support for modularity,
computable expressions, multiple and user-defined syntaxes, automatic
garbage collection, multiple-priority logical interrupts and complete
error recovery.  The development environment features a windowed
development environment and extensive on-line documentation.  Finally,
the Extension Feature of IBM SAA AD/Cycle Prolog/2 offers access to
general-purpose object-oriented programming facilities.  These support
object attributes, inheritance, demons, methods, and message passing.
They are supported by a specific development environment including an
integrated, interactive debugger.  Prolog code can be treated as an
object. For more information, write to Wayne Chan <waynec@vnet.ibm.com>, 
IBM Prolog Product Manager, 93881 Noisy-le-Grand CEDEX. Please
reference "Program Number 5696-308 (OS/2) 5696-309(MVS & VM)".

ICE (Integrated Constraint Engine) is a Constraint Logic Programming
extension to IBM SAA AD/Cycle Prolog for OS/2. ICE contains a linear
constraint solver and a domain reduction solver, working on real
interval variables and finite domain (and boolean) variables. The real
linear solver is based on a revised Simplex technology, which gives it
excellent performance for a CLP language. It features: detection of
implicit equalities, minimization and maximization predicates, query
for a solution, delay of non-linear equations, control of precision
and refactorization.  The domain reduction solver handles both
continuous and finite domain variables. The solver handles both
(non-)linear arithmetic constraints and several "symbolic" constraints
(min, max, element, no_overlap...).  A complete set of tools for
handling Boolean constraints is also provided. When dealing with real
variables, the solution can be refined using the dichotomy and
solve-by-refutation predicates built into ICE.  Finally, basic
primitives are offered for implementing various implicit enumeration
schemes.  But the most important feature and novelty of ICE is the
tight integration between the two solvers: when a variable appears
both in linear and domain reduction constraints, variations on its
bounds computed by one solver are taken into account by the other.
This allows the use of ICE for many complex, hybrid problems, as well
as for more classical Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems, for
which a generic Branch & Bound procedure is also provided. Other
features of ICE include advanced meta-programming, compilation of
constraints and the ability to build ICE on top of an existing IBM
Prolog workspace.  ICE comes with both paper and on-line documentation
as well as several examples showing its capabilities.  For more
information, write to Henri Beringer <beringer@vnet.ibm.com> or Bruno
De Backer <bdb@vnet.ibm.com>, IBM France Scientific Center, 68-76 Quai
de la Rap'ee, 75592 PARIS CEDEX 12, FRANCE. Please reference "Program

IBM PROLOG for AIX/6000 (PFA) is a high performance implementation of
the PROLOG language, combined with a powerful programming environment,
especially designed for the IBM RISC System/6000 under AIX. PFA was
developed by BIM as an adaptation of ProLog by BIM for the IBM RISC
System/6000 under AIX. It was selected by IBM Europe as their
official PROLOG implementation for the RISC System/6000 (Program
Number 5776-FAH). For more information: In North-America contact BIM
