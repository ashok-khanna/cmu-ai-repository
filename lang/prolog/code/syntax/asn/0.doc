Name:         ASN

Summary:      Prolog abstract syntax notation translator.

Version:      14-NOV-89 (17-JUL-89)

Description: 

   ASN (Abstract Syntax Notation) is a formalism for describing
   language syntax. Grammars are written as Prolog terms, and compiled
   into an optimized Definite Clause Grammar.

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs in Edinburgh-compatible Prologs. (The original
              version used some Quintus-specific predicates, mainly 
              for I/O. These have been replaced.)
