Description: 

   GULP (Graph Unification Logic Programming) is a Prolog preprocessor
   for unification-based grammar. It translates feature structures into
   standard Prolog programs. GULP is as powerful and concise as PATR-II
   and other grammar development tools, while retaining all the
   versatility of Prolog.
