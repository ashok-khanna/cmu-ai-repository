Summary:      Jocelyn Paine's Prolog grammar-rule translator

Version:      6-DEC-87

Description: 

   This program defines a predicate, 'grexpand', for expanding Definite
   Clause Grammar Rules into Prolog clauses. These are the standard form
   of DCG rules, for which a translator is built-in to many Prologs.  The
   translator is essentially the same as the one published in
   "Programming in Prolog", by Clocksin and Mellish.

Requires:     

Ports:        Edinburgh-compatible Prologs
