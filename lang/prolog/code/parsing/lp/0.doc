Name:         LP

Summary:      Parser for Prolog written in C.

Version:      31-MAR-94

Description: 

   LP is a parser for standard Prolog text written in C. It consists of
   only three modules (tokenizer, parser, and display routine) and an
   interface module to integrate it with an existing Prolog system. It is
   completely deterministic and about 10 times faster than O'Keefe's
   public domain parser written in Prolog.

   A small demonstration program is included. This program is not optimal
   at all, but shows how it can be used.

Requires:     

Ports:        Tested in BinProlog.
