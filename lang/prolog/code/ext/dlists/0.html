<H2>DLISTS: Prolog doubly-linked list package.</H2>
<pre>
<A HREF="index.html">lang/prolog/code/ext/dlists/</A>
</pre>
<listing>
 
This is Jocelyn Paine's revised version of a doubly-linked
list-handling package sent to the Prolog Digest by Philip Dart of
Melbourne University. The syntax has been changed slightly to run in
Edinburgh Prolog; otherwise, the predicates are the same.

Philip sent the original package as a joke:
    "Following the comments [on the bulletin board] about Fortran as an
    AI language, Melbourne University Department of Artificial
    Intelligence has decided to convert all of its Fortran AI programs
    to NU-Prolog. This package has been written as an aid to this
    conversion.

    Doubly-linked list package: Why use boring old single-linked lists
    when doubly-linked list could make your list processing applications
    run as never before.

    P.S. Don't forget to turn off the occur-check in your version of
    Prolog!"

However, it seems that the package might be useful in those few cases
where you really *do* need circular structures (rather than using
edge-sets to represent graphs), and Philip has agreed to let Jocelyn
redistribute his package on this basis.

Predicates defined:
    test                         Demonstrate the predicates
    dPrev(D, _)                  Get previous node
    dNext(D, _)                  Get next node
    dHead(D, _)                  Get head of list
    dTail(D, _)                  Get tail of list
    isD(D)                       Is this a doubly-linked list?
    portray(D)                   Portray doubly-linked list
    dAppend(X, Y, Z)             Append for doubly-linked lists
    dAdj(L, R)                   Are these adjacent nodes?
