Name:         

Summary:      Bounded-length version of the list-length predicate

Version:      21-AUG-93 (26-FEB-91)

Description: 

   Many Prologs have a built-in function length/2 that can be used either
     [1] to determine the length of a given list; or
     [2] to non-deterministically create longer and longer lists.

   This package defines a function length_bounded/3 with the following
   specification:

       length_bounded(?L,?Len,+Max)
       "L is a list of length Len, where Len<=Max".

   Like length/2, it can bind L to successively longer lists when Len is
   unbound, but subject to the constraint that Len<=Max. It uses ":-wait"
   declarations and hence needs to run under Sicstus Prolog.

Requires:     

Ports:        Runs in Sicstus Prolog.
