Package:      lang/prolog/code/io/pl2sql/

Name:         PL2SQL

Summary:      Prolog to SQL interface

Version:      1.1 (21-DEC-92)

Description: 

   PL2SQL is a Prolog to SQL compiler. It translates database access
   requests, which consist of a projection term and a database goal, to
   the appropriate SQL query. This compiler may be useful in
   Prolog-to-RDBMS interfaces, which often allow SQL queries as string
   arguments (e.g. the Quintus Prolog Oracle interface and others).
   The compiler allows negation, arithmetic, and aggregate functions.

Requires:     standard Edinburgh Prolog

Ports:        Runs in Eclipse (formerly SEPIA Prolog), Quintus Prolog,
              LPA MacProlog, and some other Prologs.

              The Prolog to SQL compiler is part of a commercial
              package (ProDBI of Keylink Ltd, England). However, in
              Draxler's arrangements with them they agreed to allow
              the compiler to be distributed for free.
