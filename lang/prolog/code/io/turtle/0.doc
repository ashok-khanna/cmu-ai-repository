Name:         

Summary:      Prolog turtle graphics.

Version:      12-DEC-87 (25-MAR-87)

Description: 

   This is a simple turtle graphics program for vt100 terminals written
   by David Lau-Kee and originally posted to the Prolog Digest. A few
   syntactic errors were corrected by Salleh Mustaffa, University of
   Manchester.  There may be some problems due to control characters in
   the program not being properly transmitted through email in the
   original posting.

   A limited subset of turtle graphics capabilities is implemented: You
   can tell the turtle to turn 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise, and
   to move forward X steps.  Backtracking over these primitives causes
   them to be undone.

Requires:     VT100 terminal. The cursor-moving commands are terminal-specific.

Ports:        Runs in C-Prolog 1.5 and should be easily portable to
              Edinburgh-compatible Prologs.
