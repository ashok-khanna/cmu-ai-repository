Summary:      Complexity Analysis System for LOGic

Version:      1.0 alpha (20-DEC-92)

Description: 

   CASLOG (Complexity Analysis System for LOGic) is an experimental
   semi-automatic complexity analysis system for logic programs. It can
   perform the worst-case analysis for complexity measures: argument size
   complexity, number of solutions complexity, and time complexity.

   CASLOG extends the techniques developed for analyzing imperative and
   functional languages to deal with nondeterminism and generation of
   multiple solutions via backtracking in logic languages. The analyses
   for different complexity measures are implemented in a unified
   framework and share several common features. First, the predicates in
   a program are processed in an order generated by a bottom-up
   topological sorting over the call graph of the program. Second, the
   complexity function for a predicate is derived from the complexity
   function of its clauses by using the information about the mutual
   exclusion relationships between its clauses. Third, the complexity
   function for a clause is inferred based on the data dependency
   relationships between its literals. Fourth, the complexity functions
   for recursive clauses are in the form of difference equations and are
   transformed into closed form functions using difference equation
   solving techniques. This unified framework can simplify proofs of
   correctness and the implementation of the algorithms.
