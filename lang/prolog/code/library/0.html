<H2>Prolog Library: A collection of Prolog programs from the 
              defunct Prolog-Hackers mailing list.</H2>

This directory contains a collection of Prolog programs from the
now-defunct Prolog Hackers mailing list. Fernando Pereira maintained
the collection.  Many of the programs are over 10 years old. The
programs were originally tested on DEC-10s and DEC-20s with the
Edinburgh Prolog system. Compatibility with modern Prologs has not
been tested, but most of the programs should run with only minor
changes. Some of the files in this package have been duplicated
elsewhere in the Prolog Repository, but we felt it was important to
retain the package intact despite the duplication.

The library includes implementations of trace, advice, macro
expansion, gensym, heaps, sorting, queues, random number generators,
set manipulation routines, splay trees, binary trees, and association
lists. There's also an implementation of Mackworth's AC-3 algorithm,
several debuggers, a Prolog parser, a top-level loop, graph processing
utilities, a metacircular interpreter for Prolog, a program for
converting formulae in FOPC to clausal form, a translator from
Definite Clause Grammars to Prolog, a compiler for Flat Concurrent
Prolog, routines for structure crunching, a rational arithmetic
package, an algebraic expression simplifier, a pretty printer,
tutorial programs, cross-referencing programs, a Prolog lint, and a
Prolog type checker.  The library also includes the ECRC benchmarks,
the WGSYM (Information Processing Society of Japan) Lisp/Prolog
benchmarks, and the Tektronix/Portland State University benchmarks.
Among the documents are the user's manual for Edinburgh Prolog on the
DEC-10, the original Scribe draft manuscript for a Prolog standard
by O'Keefe, and a few bibliographies.
