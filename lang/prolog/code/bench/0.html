This directory contains code for benchmarking Prolog implementation
compatibility and performance.

Naive reverse is the classical benchmark for computing LIPS (Logical
Inferences Per Second). However, the utility of small benchmark
programs like naive reverse (NREV) is questionable, since it may not
necessarily reflect overall system performance. For example, NREV
doesn't exercise the two main features of Prolog -- backtracking and
unification. In practice, performance on large programs is much more
important. Some of the benchmarks use larger programs, such as
cryptarithms, theorem provers, and chart parsing, to give a better
picture of system performance on real problems. Thus it is better
to use the Pereira or Holmer benchmarks than the NREV benchmark.
