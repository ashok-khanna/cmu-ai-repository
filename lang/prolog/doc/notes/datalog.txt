There are many "datalog interpreters" available;
most of which probably run under sunos 4.X

Here is a very incomplete list,
and I hope I do not offend those that I have left off.
Maybe this should be added to the FAQ?
Here it is in alphabetical order since it puts our system first ;-)
By the way, these systems are much more than just Datalog interpreters,
many of them allow function symbols and almost arbitrary use of negation,
but Datalog programs are guaranteed to terminate on them.

Aditi
from the University of Melbourne is available as a "Beta-release".
send mail to aditi@cs.mu.oz.au (mail me if it bounces).
It is free, but you will need to sign some sort of license.

Coral
from the University of Wisconsin is available
via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.wisc.edu

EKS
from ECRC.  I seem to remember that it is currently not available,
but I could be wrong.

Glue-Nail
from Standford University.
I am not sure who you contact to get a copy of this.

LDL
from MCC.
I am not sure who you contact to get a copy of this.

XSB
from University of NY Stony Brook is 
via anonymous ftp
- XSB, system with OLDT-resolution and HiLog capability.  Compiler
  for Linux, Sun, Sparc, and NeXT.  Anonymous FTP from
  cs.sunysb.edu (130.245.1.15), directory pub/XSB.
  E-mail: xsb-contact@cs.sunysb.edu


Finally, if you want a very portable 5000 lines of C code
that can evaluate Datalog with stratified negation but without arithmetic,
and does it in the most naive manner imaginable
(it will terminate on all queries though!),
then I could send you a program I wrote seven years ago!

Cheers,
