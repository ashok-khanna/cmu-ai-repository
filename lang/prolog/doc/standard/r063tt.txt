                  ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG17 - Prolog

The following document is enclosed for review and action:

    WG17 N92 - Prolog Part 1, General Core: Committee Draft 1.0

Roger Scowen (Convener), DITC/93, National Physical Laboratory
Teddington, Middlesex, England   TW11 0LW
6 April 1992        Tel: +44 81 943 6956

SC22 member bodies are being asked whether or not they approve
registration of this draft as a "Committee Draft" (CD). You may 
therefore receive a copy from your national standards organization 
and be asked to contribute to a national view.

If the vote is favourable, JTC1 will be ballotted to approve 
registration of this draft as a "Committee Draft".

WG17's remaining standardization tasks for Part 1 are to amend the 
draft to correct errors and achieve greater acceptability. These 
stages will be monitored by further ballots to agree on a "Draft 
International Standard" (DIS), and finally, "International Standard". 
This process will take at least two to three years, and every 
negative ballot result will add about eight months to the time.
