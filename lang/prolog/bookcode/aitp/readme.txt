This files in this directory contain the programs in the book 
   
              "Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Prolog"

by Yoav Shoham.

The files are organized hierarchically; each chapter forms a separate
subdirectory, and files in this subdirectly correspond to sections.
For example, to the programs in Chapter 2 Section 4 appear in the
file chapter2/section4.pl

We have done our best to eliminate errors and mismatches between these
files and the programs in the book. Some errors undoubtedly remain. 
In case of a mismatch, more likely than not the error is in the book rather 
than the code. 

If you are interested in the entire code, simply retrieve the file aipp.tar.Z
Otherwise, retrieve the particular files in which you are interested.
