<H2>TUTOR: Jocelyn Paine's Logic Programming Tutor</H2>

This is the program described in Jocelyn Paine's book
   Jocelyn Paine, "The Logic Programming Tutor", Intellect, 1992
published by Intellect in the UK and Kluwer elsewhere. It is a
front-end designed to introduce novices to Prolog, and can accept
facts and questions in either Prolog or infix "Logic", translating
between the two. It has a simple number-editor (Basic-like), and a
portable screen-editor. It also comes with a set of eight "scripts".
These are lessons which it displays one section at a time, inviting
the student to try doing simple exercises, or to try experiments with
Prolog.

The distribution also includes some auxiliary software, including a
trading game, several example knowledge bases, a copy of Dave Bowen
and Chris Mellish's cross-referencing program, a Prolog 'lint', an
autotester, a profiler for timing goals (based on chapter 3 of "The
Craft of Prolog"), and a random number generator.

Also included is LaTeX source for the supplementary exercises and
notes from Paine's book.
