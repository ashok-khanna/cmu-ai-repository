Just a brief announcement to let readers of comp.lang.prolog know that
the second edition of The Art of Prolog is now available. It has been
out for a month.

Information about ordering the book from MIT Press is available from
me via return email. My sense of netiquette made me not include the
information here.

The new edition contains 24 chapters, one more than previously.
Details of the changes in the new edition I will be happy to explain
in an email message.

The programs presented in the book are available via anonyomus ftp
from ftp.cwru.edu in the subdirectory ArtOfProlog.
There is a subdirectory for each chapter of the book containing the
text of the programs in that chapter.

There is also a simple instructor's manual available from MIT
Press for instructors ordering the book for a course.
