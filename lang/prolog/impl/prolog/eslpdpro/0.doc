Name:         ESL Prolog-2 (PD Version)

Summary:      Good performance public domain (limited) version of a
              Prolog for MS-DOS systems.

Version:      2.30 (30-JAN-91)

Description: 

   ESL Prolog-2 (PD Version) is a public domain Prolog interpreter for
   IBM PC (MS-DOS) systems with good performance. It deviates 
   slightly from Edinburgh standard (strings "like this" are not lists
   of ASCII codes), but you can add a declaration that makes it fully 
   Edinburgh-compatible. (To do this, add the line
      :- state(token_class,_,dec10).
   at the beginning of the program.) 

   ESL PD Prolog is a more limited version of the commercial version of
   the interpreter, which is available from Expert Systems Ltd. of
   Oxford, England (see contact below). [Note: As of 11-NOV-94, ESL
   Prolog has been sold to ESI.] The commercial version is an Edinburgh
   standard prolog interpreter and compiler with several extensions, and
   runs on Sun3, Sun4, HP9000 (Unix), RS/6000 (Unix), VAX (VMS), IBM PC
   (MS-DOS, Windows 3.0/3.1), and 386s. The windows version includes BIPs
   for programming windows graphics and dialogues.

   Documentation is available as a 2-volume set published by Ablex (type
   "prolog2" for info). ESL Prolog is also discussed extensively in Tony
   Dodd's book "Prolog: A Logical Approach" from Oxford University Press.
