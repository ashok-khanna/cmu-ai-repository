Summary:      Compiler for higher-order Lambda Prolog

Version:      1.8 (5-NOV-93)

Description: 

   Prolog/Mali is a compiler for the higher-order language Lambda Prolog.
   Lambda Prolog is an extension of Prolog defined by Miller. It is an
   extension of Prolog where terms are simply typed lambda terms and
   clauses are higher order hereditary Harrop formulas.  The main
   novelties are universal quantification on goals and implication.
   Prolog/Mali is a complete system which includes a C translator, a
   linker, libraries, runtime, and documentation, and runs on UNIX.

   Possible applications are the same as standard Prolog, but with a real
   plus for those where scoping of variables is important, such as
   theorem-proving, implementation of type systems, and formal
   transformation on structured programs.

   The system is a compiler (written in Prolog/Mali) which produces C
   code.  The execution scheme uses Mali (an abstract memory for
   representing terms with efficient space management). Accordingly,
   it is necessary to compile MALI before compiling PM. A copy of MALI
   version 6 (16-DEC-93) is included in this directory.

   (Lambda Prolog extends Prolog with a polymorphic type system,
   higher-order programming, simply typed lambda-terms as data
   structures, higher-order unification, scoping mechanisms for program
   clauses and parameters, and modules and data abstraction.)
