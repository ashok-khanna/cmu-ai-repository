Name:         XSB Prolog

Summary:      Prolog extended with OLDT (tabling) and Hilog terms.

Version:      1.3 (14-SEP-93)

Description: 

   XSB is a Prolog-based Logic Programming System that extends the
   standard functionality of Prolog with an implementation of OLDT
   (tabling) and HiLog terms. XSB includes an optimizing compiler, C
   interface, a module system, list processing libraries, and dynamic
   loading. It is a descendent of PSB-Prolog and SB-Prolog.

   OLDT resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing
   programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not.
   Users interested in Parsing, Program Analysis, and memory-resident
   Deductive Database applications may benefit from XSB.

   XSB's OLDT implementation:

       o  Is incorporated at the emulator level for maximal efficiency.
          The speed improvement over meta-interpreters written by
          the XSB group is 2-3 orders of magnitude, with considerable
          improvements in space as well.

       o  Evaluates programs with (left-to-right modularly) stratified
          negation and aggregation.

       o  Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either
          automatically by the system or manually by the user.

       o  Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to
          program a number of applications like meta-interpreters for
          the well-founded semantics (provided as an example program).

       o  Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code, including
          cuts (subject to weak semantic restructions), meta-logical
          predicates, second-order predicates, etc.

   HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate
   symbols can be variable or structured.  This allows unification to be
   performed on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the
   arguments of the predicates.

   XSB's HiLog implementation:

       o  Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can
          be used anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.

       o  Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for
          HiLog terms.

   Compiler optimizations for HiLog terms are currently under development.

Requires:     GNU C compiler.

Ports:        XSB runs on Sun3, Sun4, 386/486 PCs (Linux and 386 BSD),
              SGI machines (IRIX), HP 300/400 series (HP-UX) and NeXT,
              and can be compiled using either the GNU C compiler or
              the Sun C compiler. Porting XSB to any 32-bit machine
              running Unix should be straightforward.  

              THIS IS A BETA RELEASE.
