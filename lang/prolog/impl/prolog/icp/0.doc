Name:         ICP

Summary:      IC-Prolog ][, a multi-threaded Prolog implementation
              suitable for distributed applications.

Version:      ICP 0.96 (28-SEP-93); Parlog 1.5.9 (29-SEP-93)

Description: 

   IC-Prolog ][ (ICP) is a multi-threaded Prolog system developed at
   Imperial College. Multiple threads allow queries to be executed
   concurrently.  ICP also has an interface to Unix TCP/IP system calls
   and "mailboxes", a high level communication system.  This interface
   together with multiple threads enables distributed applications (such
   as client/server systems) to be written in Prolog.

   The package also includes a preprocessor for the Logic & Objects (L&O)
   object-oriented extension to Prolog. This gives a powerful structuring
   mechanism for Prolog programs as well as providing a logical
   interpretation of inheritance and other object-oriented features.
   (The sources for the L&O extension is also available to LPA MacProlog
   users in the subdirectory 'lo'.)

   Parlog has been integrated with IC-Prolog ][ as a separate thread, so
   applications may be written in either language depending on which is
   more suitable. (Standalone versions of the Parlog system for Sun-3 and
   Sun-4 can be found in the parlog/ directory.)

   The package also includes a simple expert system shell called Skilaki.

Requires:     

Ports:        The distribution has been tested on Sun3 and Sun4
              running SunOS 4.1 or later. At present the emulator is
              available only in binary form. Source code may be
              released later when project finishes.
