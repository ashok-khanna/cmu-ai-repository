IC-Prolog ][ (ICP) is a multi-threaded Prolog system developed at
Imperial College. Multiple threads allow queries to be executed
concurrently.  ICP also has an interface to Unix TCP/IP system calls
and "mailboxes", a high level communication system.  This interface
together with multiple threads enables distributed applications (such
as client/server systems) to be written in Prolog.

The package also includes a preprocessor for the Logic & Objects (L&O)
object-oriented extension to Prolog. This gives a powerful structuring
mechanism for Prolog programs as well as providing a logical
interpretation of inheritance and other object-oriented features.
(The sources for the L&O extension is also available to LPA MacProlog
users in the subdirectory 'lo'.)

Parlog has been integrated with IC-Prolog ][ as a separate thread, so
applications may be written in either language depending on which is
more suitable. (Standalone versions of the Parlog system for Sun-3 and
Sun-4 can be found in the parlog/ directory.)

The package also includes a simple expert system shell called Skilaki.

Version:      ICP 0.96 (28-SEP-93); Parlog 1.5.9 (29-SEP-93)

Ports:        The distribution has been tested on Sun3 and Sun4
              running SunOS 4.1 or later. At present the emulator is
              available only in binary form. Source code may be
              released later when project finishes.
