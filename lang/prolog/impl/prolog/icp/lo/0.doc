Summary:      Logic and Objects

Version:      

Description: 

   Logic and Objects (L&O) is an object-oriented extension to Prolog.
   This gives a powerful structuring mechanism for Prolog programs as
   well as providing a logical interpretation of inheritance and other
   object-oriented features.

   This directory contains the original version of L&O, which runs under
   LPA MacProlog on the Apple Macintosh.  The second implementation is
   included in the IC-Prolog II distribution itself.

Requires:     LPA MacProlog
