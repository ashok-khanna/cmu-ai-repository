Logic and Objects (L&O) is an object-oriented extension to Prolog.
The language is described in the book

	Logic and Objects, Francis G. McCabe
	Prentice Hall international series in computer science
	Prentice Hall International (UL) Ltd, 1992

There are currently two implementations of L&O.  The original version
runs under LPA MacProlog on the Apple Macintosh.  The MacProlog source
files have passed through StuffIt, BinHex and compress to produce the
file L&O.sit.hqx.Z in this directory.  Note that these files are of
limited use unless you have a copy of LPA MacProlog.

The second implementation is included in the IC-Prolog II distribution
file /computing/programming/languages/prolog/icprolog/ICP-<VERSION>.tar.Z
on src.doc.ic.ac.uk [Internet: 146.169.2.1].
