Summary:      A slow Prolog for MS-DOS systems.

Version:      1.90 (5-MAY-86)

Description: 

   A.D.A. Public Domain Prolog is a rather slow implementation of Prolog
   for MS-DOS systems, originally a product of Automata Design Associates
   (now defunct).

   The distribution includes some sample expert systems, including Simon
   Blackwell's "PIE" Truth Maintenance System, a few games written in
   Prolog (including Towers of Hanoi), a few puzzles, and Ludwig J.
   Schumacher's ATN-based natural language parser.
