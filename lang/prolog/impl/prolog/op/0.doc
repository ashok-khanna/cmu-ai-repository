Summary:      Prolog interpreter for the Apple Macintosh

Version:      1.0.2d0

Description: 

   Open Prolog (OP) is a Prolog interpreter for the Apple Macintosh.  It
   follows the so-called 'Edinburgh' syntax and supports most standard
   Prolog features, including Definite Clause Grammars.  OP includes a
   debugger, good syntax error detection, and a flexible text editor. It
   is reasonably fast, and can execute large programs.  Extra predicates
   can be added via drop-in external predicates, in a manner similar
   to Hypercard's XCMDs.

Requires:     Macintosh Plus or higher. OP is 32-bit clean and runs
              under AUX.

Ports:
