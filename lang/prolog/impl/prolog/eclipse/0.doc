Name:         ECLiPSe

Summary:      ECRC Logic Programming System

Version:      3.4

Description: 

   ECLiPSe (ECRC Logic Programming System) combines the functionalities
   of several ECRC systems, including Sepia, MegaLog and CHIP.  ECLiPSe
   includes a Prolog compiler with extended functionality that is Quintus
   and SICStus compatible, a tightly connected database system based on
   the BANG file system, a CLP system, and an interface to the Tcl/Tk X11
   toolkit. The BANG database can store not only relations, but also any
   Prolog structures and programs. The CLP system contains several
   libraries with various types of constraint handling schemes, including
   atomic finite domains, linear rational constraints, CHR (constraint
   handling rules) and Propia (generalized propagation).  It also
   supports writing further extensions like new user-defined constraints
   or complete new constraint solvers.  ECLiPSe also includes a profiler,
   user-definable syntax, metaterms as first-class citizens, coroutining,
   and unlimited precision integer and rational numbers.
