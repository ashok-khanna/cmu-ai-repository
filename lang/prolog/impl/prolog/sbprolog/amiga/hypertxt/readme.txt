This archive contains the SBProlog Manual for version 2.5 of the language.
The manual is in Thinker format.  Thinker is a hypertext authoring program
by Poor Person Software for the Amiga family of computers.  I formatted
the manual with Thinker 2.1.  I don't know if it will work with earlier
versions of the program.
