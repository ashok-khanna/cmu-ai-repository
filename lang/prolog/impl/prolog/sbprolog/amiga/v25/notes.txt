A few notes on the amiga port of SB Prolog 2.5:

The port was done using version 1.3 of AmigaDOS, and has not been
tested at all under version 1.2.  You should not expect it to run
on older versions of AmigaDOS.

The port was done using Aztec C 3.6a, and uses that compiler's style of
environment variables.  The enclosed program "setenv" should allow simple
access to Aztec C environment variables for those without Aztec C.  It
woule be fairly easy to add a new command line option to specify the
environment variable SIMPATH there, but I have not done that since I am
pressed for time.

To run the system, you need to do the following:

1) set up the three directories modlib, cmplib and lib.  Extract the
	contents of the ZOO file using the full pathnames option
2) set up the environment variable SIMPATH so that it points to these
	three directories
3) run sbprolog
	- usually, when you run sbprolog, you specify the initial bytecode
	file.  This is usally $readloop in the modlib directory.  This is the
	usual PROLOG reader.
	- also, there are several command line options.  SPB2.5 has a memory
	shortage, at least on the 1 meg amiga 2000 I was using.  It is easy to
	overflow existing memory.  On this 1 meg machine, the default memory
	requirements are too high.  So I always specified the program memory
	as 60000 (-p 60000) and the stack as 40000 (-m 40000). This seemed to
	be the most that my 1-meg machine could handle.  



The sources for this version of SBprolog will work on either Unix or an Amiga.
If on an Amiga, specify at compile time the flag -dAMIGA=1.  This will
compile for the Amiga.  There are two main sets of C files, the main set,
and a subdirectory of that directory called builtin.  There are two make
files also.  I compile this using Aztec C, version 3.6a, and the Amiga
makefiles are configured for Aztec.  If using another compiler, make sure that
you have 32 bit integers and use the large memory model.

There are two make files for the two machines: unixmake & amigamake, and for
the builtin subdirectory, bunixmake & bamigamake.


Finally, the $readloop that is included in this release is compiled for the
Amiga.  On the Amiga, the path separator is '!', on Unix it is ':'.  This
necessatated recompiling $readloop for the Amiga.  If you wish to use SBP on
Unix, you must recompile $readloop.P (in cmplib srces), after you have the
C sources compiled on Unix.
-----------------------------
My SIMPATH looked like 

FastHD:bin/set SIMPATH=FastHD:nick/sbp2_5/modlib!FastHD:nick/sbp2_5/lib!FastHD:nick/sbp2_5/cmplib!!

and I aliased sbrun to be:
:nick/sbp2_5/newsim/sbprolog -p 60000 -m 40000 :nick/sbp2_5/modlib/$readloop
