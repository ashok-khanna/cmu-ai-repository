This is a truncated version of the file notes_on_amiga_port in the
SBProlog 2.5 Amiga release.

In order to run this version of SBProlog at all you will need 1 megabyte
of memory.  With 1 megabyte it will be fairly crippled.  Since our Amiga
only has one megabyte, we were not able to test the port properly.  The
distribution includes full sources.

This version was compiled using AmigaDOS version 1.3.  It has not been
tested at all under version 1.2.

This version was compiled using Aztec C version 3.6a, and uses that
compiler's environment variable mechanism.  The included program, "setenv",
provides a primitive access to environment variables for users without
Aztec C.

In summary, you may not be interested in this Prolog if your Amiga has
less than a couple megabytes of RAM and a hard disk.  If you have such
a beast, please check it out and let us know how it fares.

Note: the distribution is presented in ZOO archive form.  The file
amigazoo contains a copy of the zoo archiver for the amiga.  In order
to extract everything from the archive, you would need to create the
following subdirectories

c_src2_5 c_src2_5/builtin2_5 lib libsrc modlib modlibsrc cmplib cmplibsrc

from whatever directory you are installing SB Prolog in.  The command

zoo x/ sbpv2_5

would then extract the relevant files and place them in the appropriate
subdirectories.
