<H2>Aquarius Prolog: Information about Aquarius Prolog, a free

Aquarius Prolog is a high-performance, portable Prolog implementation
developed since 1989 by the Aquarius Project at UC/Berkeley, the Advanced
Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACAL) at the University of Southern
California (USC), and at Digital Equipment Corporation's Paris Research
Laboratory. The developers are Tom Getzinger, Ralph Clarke Haygood, and
Peter Van Roy. Aquarius Prolog includes:

   - A compiler with global analysis.  The compiler is built around the
     Berkeley Abstract Machine (BAM) execution model for Prolog. BAM
     retains desirable features of the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM),
     but allows for significant further optimizations and is easier to
     map onto actual general-purpose machines.

   - A back-end that maps the BAM onto various actual general-purpose
     machines, including MIPS R3000 (DEC Ultrix and MIPS RISC/os),
     SPARC (SunOS), HP 9000 300/400 with MC68020, MC68030 or MC68040
     processors (HP-UX), and Sun3 (SunOS).

   - A run-time system offering substantially the same built-in 
     predicates and memory management as Quintus Prolog, with additions 
     such as two kinds of destructive assignment.  Most of the built-in 
     predicates are written in Prolog, with little or no performance 
     penalty.

Aquarius Prolog also includes an interpreter and documentation.
Aquarius Prolog comes in two distributions, Enduser and Full. The
latter includes full source code and implementation notes.

Ports:        MIPS R3000 (DEC Ultrix and MIPS RISC/os), SPARC (SunOS),
              HP 9000 300/400 with MC68020, MC68030 or MC68040
              processors (HP-UX), and Sun3 (SunOS).

Copying:      Free, after returning a license agreement.
              
              Aquarius Prolog may be obtained free of charge from USC, after signing
              and returning a license agreement. To get the license agreement, send a
              message to listserv@acal-server.usc.edu with
              get aquarius-info license
              in the message body. To get more information about the Full and
              Enduser distributions, send the listserver a message containing
              one or both of the two lines:
              get aquarius-info readme-full
              get aquarius-info readme-enduser
              To subscribe to the aquarius-prolog mailing list, send the listserver a
              message with body:
              subscribe aquarius-prolog <Your real name here>
              To get more information about the abilities of the listserver, send it a
              message with 'help' in the body.

CD-ROM:       No.
