BinProlog 3.00 is now available by ftp from

  clement.info.umoncton.ca  (139.103.16.2)
  ftp.elis.rug.ac.be        (157.193.67.1)

The full distribution is in the file: 
   
  BinProlog3.0.tar.gz.

BinProlog has been developed by Paul Tarau and it is based on his
BinWAM abstract machine, a specialization of the WAM for the efficient
execution of continuation passing binary logic programs.

BinProlog is a fairly complete Prolog implementation featuring both
C-emulated execution and generation of standalone applications by
compilation to C. Some other features are:

  - a Tcl/Tk Motif-style visual programming interface,
  - dynamic code, intuitionistic and linear implication,
  - logical and permanent global variables, 
  - backtrackable destructive assignment,
  - circular term unification, 
  - extended DCGs (now built in the engine as `invisible grammars'),
  - continuation manipulation primitives, 
  - a garbage-collected hashing based global dictionary for constant-time
    sparse arrays and graphs,
  - efficient high-order programming builtins,
  - C-compatible floating point operations, 
  - fully C-ified one file executables.

This distribution contains the Prolog source of the compiler and
executable emulators for:

  - Sparc - Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.x; 
  - DEC Alpha - 64 bit version; 
  - MIPS - DEC; 
  - 68k - NeXT, SUN3;
  - R6000 - IBM;
  - HP PA-RISC
  - 386-486 Linux
  - 386-486 (MsDOS+Windows 3.1 - with DOS-extender go32 ver. 1.10).

A new term compression technique (joint work with Ulrich Neumerkel)
reduces heap-consumption and adds some extra speed.

Prolog sources of BinProlog's compiler and builtin libraries are
included in the distribution. BinProlog uses optimized versions of
D.H.D. Warren and R.A. O'Keefe's public domain read.pl, write.pl, DCGs
and a fast C-supported transformer to binary programs.

Multi-BinProlog 3.00 is a multi-threaded Linda-style parallel extension
to BinProlog for Solaris 2.3 developed by Koen De Bosschere.  Koen's
ISO C-parser and C-writer with full C-sources are also available for
considerably faster I/O and stream-support.

Some research papers explaining the implementations, example programs,
benchmarks and a User's Guide can be found at the same site.

BinProlog is free for research and other non-profit purposes.  Use in
industrial applications, licensing of full C-sources with ability to use
BinProlog's simple but powerful C-interface or the full BinProlog
system as an embedded logic engine, need a separate agreement (see
files BINARY.LICENSING and SOURCE.LICENSING in the distribution).

             BinProlog 3.00 minimal configuration:

Uncompressed versions of BinProlog 3.00 are now also available on

  clement.info.umoncton.ca  (139.103.16.2)
  ftp.elis.rug.ac.be        (157.193.67.1)

in directory BinProlog/UNCOMPRESSED. If you do not want the full
distribution you can get only the binary for your particular
architecture/operating system from the directory:

  /BinProlog/BinProlog3.0/bin

i.e. one of the following:

wam.sparc.solaris.gz*		wam.pc.linux.gz*
wam.sparc.sunos.gz*		wam.r6000.ibm.gz*		
wam.parisc.hpux.gz		wam.parisc.hp.gz*
wam.alpha.dec.gz*		ru.68k.sun3.gz*
wam.mips.dec.gz*	        ru.68k.next.gz*
386/                            ../src/wam.bp

  /BinProlog/BinProlog3.0/doc/art.ps (UserGuide).

After getting the files, something like:

  wam.alpha.dec

or

  ru.68k.next wam.bp

is all you need to run BinProlog 3.00.

For DOS/Windows 3.1 machines you need src/wam.bp and the files in

   BinProlog/BinProlog3.0/bin/386

only.
