Name:         BinProlog

Summary:      Fast, small, and portable Prolog compiler.

Description:

   BinProlog replaces the WAM by a more compact continuation passing
   logic engine based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic
   programs.  It includes an interface Tcl/Tk. 
   
   The compiler makes 528 KLIPS on a Sparc 10-40 (101 KLIPS on a NeXT)
   and still uses a very small (49K under Solaris 2.1) emulator, making
   it among the fastest freely available C-emulated Prologs (3-5 times
   faster than C-Prolog, 2-3 times faster than SWI-prolog, 1.5-2 times
   faster than (X)SB-prolog and close to C-emulated Sicstus 2.1.).
   
   BinProlog's very small code-size and high performances make it
   suitable to be integrated in industrial C-applications that need 
   the services of an embedded logic programming engine.
   
   Multi-BinProlog 2.00 is a prototype Linda-style parallel extension to
   BinProlog 1.71 developed by Koen De Bosschere and Paul Tarau. This
   version uses Koen's C-parser and C-writer which together speed-up IO
   considerably. It works with shared-memory and remote procedure calls.
   
   BinProlog includes many examples, such as a VT100 implementation of
   Tetris, a breadth-first meta-interpreter, an implementation of
   backpropagation (neural nets), a CHAT parser, and implementations of
   knight's tour and N-queens.
