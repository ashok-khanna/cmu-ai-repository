Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/bin_pl/bp/

Name:         BinProlog

Summary:      Fast, small, and portable Prolog compiler.

Version:      3.00 (12-SEP-94)

Description: 

   BinProlog replaces the WAM by a more compact continuation passing
   logic engine based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic
   programs.  It includes an interface Tcl/Tk. 

   BinProlog is a fairly complete Prolog implementation featuring both
   C-emulated execution and generation of standalone applications by
   compilation to C. Some other features are:

     - a Tcl/Tk Motif-style visual programming interface,
     - dynamic code, intuitionistic and linear implication,
     - logical and permanent global variables,
     - backtrackable destructive assignment,
     - circular term unification,
     - extended DCGs (now built in the engine as `invisible grammars'),
     - continuation manipulation primitives,
     - a garbage-collected hashing based global dictionary for constant-time
       sparse arrays and graphs,
     - efficient high-order programming builtins,
     - C-compatible floating point operations,
     - fully C-ified one file executables.

   The compiler makes 528 KLIPS on a Sparc 10-40 (101 KLIPS on a NeXT)
   and still uses a very small (49K under Solaris 2.1) emulator, making
   it among the fastest freely available C-emulated Prologs (3-5 times
   faster than C-Prolog, 2-3 times faster than SWI-prolog, 1.5-2 times
   faster than (X)SB-prolog and close to C-emulated Sicstus 2.1.).
   
   BinProlog's very small code-size and high performances make it
   suitable to be integrated in industrial C-applications that need 
   the services of an embedded logic programming engine.

   Multi-BinProlog 3.00 is a prototype Linda-style parallel extension to
   BinProlog for Solaris 2.3 developed by Koen De Bosschere and Paul Tarau. 
   This version uses Koen's C-parser and C-writer which together speed-up IO
   and streams considerably. It works with shared-memory and remote
   procedure calls. 

   BinProlog includes many examples, such as a VT100 implementation of
   Tetris, a breadth-first meta-interpreter, an implementation of
   backpropagation (neural nets), a CHAT parser, and implementations of
   knight's tour and N-queens.
