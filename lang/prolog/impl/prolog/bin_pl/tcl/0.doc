Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/bin_pl/tcl/

Name:         Tcl/Tk

Summary:      X-Windows Toolkits

Version:      TCL 7.3, TK 3.6

Description: 

   This directory contains the Tcl/Tk X-Windows toolkits for use with
   binprolog. Tcl stands for ``tool command language'' and is
   pronounced ``tickle.'' 

   Tcl is actually two things: a language and a library.  First, Tcl is a
   simple textual programming language, intended primarily for issuing
   commands to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers,
   illustrators, and shells. Second, Tcl is a library package that can be
   embedded in application programs.

   Tk is an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer with an
   interface to the X11 windowing system.

   For more information, see the Tcl/Tk FAQ in faq.tgz.
