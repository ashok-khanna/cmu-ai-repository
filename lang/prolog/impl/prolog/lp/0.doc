Summary:      Lambda Prolog

Version:      2.7 (10-NOV-88)

Description: 

   Lambda Prolog is an experimental implementation of a higher-order
   logic programming language.  It extends Prolog with a polymorphic type
   system, higher-order programming, simply typed lambda-terms as data
   structures, higher-order unification, scoping mechanisms for program
   clauses and parameters, and modules and data abstraction. These new
   features are provided in a principled fashion by extending the
   classical first-order theory of Horn clauses to the intuitionistic
   higher-order theory of hereditary Harrop formulas.

   Efficiency was not a consideration in the implementation, so this
   version of Lambda Prolog is slow. For a faster and more robust
   implementation of the language, see eLP (Ergo Lambda Prolog).

   The addition of higher-order unification to a programming language
   should be useful in proof systems, program transformation systems, 
   and natural language understanding systems.
