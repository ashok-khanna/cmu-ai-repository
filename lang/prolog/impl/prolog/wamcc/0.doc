Name:         WAMCC

Summary:      WAM-based Prolog to C compiler

Version:      2.2 (1-AUG-94); 2.1 (8-JUN-94)

Description: 

   WAMCC is a WAM-based Prolog to C compiler.  It conforms more or less
   to the Edinburgh standard, and includes most of the usual built-in
   predicates, a top-level, a Prolog debugger and a WAM debugger. WAMCC
   is designed to be easily extended (see clp(FD), for example). WAMCC's
   speed is halfway between SICStus emulated and SICStus native code on a
   Sparc (1.5 times faster and 1.5 times slower, respectively).

   Examples include a calendar program and the 8-queens problem.

Requires:     GCC 2.4.5 or higher

Ports:        WAMCC has been tested on Sparc workstations, DEC (Ultrix),
              Sony MIPS (R3000), and 386/486 PCs under linux. It should
              be easily ported to 32-bit machines with GCC.
