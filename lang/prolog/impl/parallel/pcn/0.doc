Summary:      Program Composition Notation

Version:      2.0 (2-FEB-93)

Description: 

   PCN (Program Composition Notation) is a system for developing and
   executing parallel programs. It is not a logic programming language,
   but it has similarities to Strand and other concurrent logic
   programming languages. PCN provides a simple language for specifying
   concurrent algorithms, interfaces to Fortran and C, a portable toolkit
   that allows applications to be developed on a workstation or small
   parallel computer and run unchanged on supercomputers, and integrated
   debugging and performance analysis tools. PCN includes a runtime
   system, compiler, linker, a set of standard libraries, virtual
   topology tools, a symbolic debugger (PDB), an execution profiler
   (Gauge), and a trace analysis tool (Upshot).

   PCN was developed at Argonne National Laboratory and the California
   Institute of Technology.
      
Requires:     

Ports:        PCN runs on Sun4, NeXT, IBM RS/6000, SGI Iris, Intel iPSC/860,
              Intel Touchstone DELTA, Sequent Symmetry running Dynix
              (not PTX), and should be easy to port to other architectures.
