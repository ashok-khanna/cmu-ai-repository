<H2>AKL: Andorra Kernel Language, a concurrent constraint

AKL (Andorra Kernel Language) is a concurrent constraint programming
language that supports both Prolog-style programming and committed
choice programming.  Its control of don't-know nondeterminism is based
on the Andorra model, which has been generalized to also deal with
nondeterminism encapsulated in guards and aggregates (such as bagof)
in a concurrent setting. 

The Basic Andorra Model is a way to execute definite clause programs
that allows dependent and-parallelism to be exploited transparently.
It also supports nice programming techniques for search programs.  The
idea is to first reduce all goals that match at most one clause.  When
no such goal exists, any goal (e.g., the left-most) may be chosen.
The BAM was proposed by David H. D. Warren, and his group at Bristol
has developed an AND-OR parallel implementation called Andorra-I,
which also supports full Prolog.  

This implementation of the AKL Programming System (AKL/PS) consists of
a compiler from AKL to PAM, a Prototype Abstract Machine for AKL, and
an emulator for PAM written in C.
