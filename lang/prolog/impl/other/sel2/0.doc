Summary:      Declarative set-processing language that generates WAM code

Version:      2

Description: 

   SEL (Subset-Equational Language) is a declarative set processing
   language. Its main features are subset and equational program clauses,
   pattern matching over sets, support for efficient iteration and
   point-wise/incremental computation over sets, the ability to define
   transitive closures through circular constraints, meta-programming and
   simple higher-order programming, and a modest user-interface including
   tracing. The language seems well-suited to a number of problems in
   graph theory, program analysis, and discrete mathematics. The SEL
   compiler is written in Quintus Prolog and the run-time system is
   written in C. It generates WAM-like code, extended to deal with
   set-matching, memoization, and the novel control structure of the
   language.

   The release comes with a user manual, bibliography of papers
   (including .dvi files), several sample programs, and source code. 
   Example programs include a miniature Eliza, higher-order and
   meta-programming with apply and univ, permutations, quicksort, 
   maxflow using min-cut, lazy evaluator for equations, shortest
   distance in a directed graph, strongly connected components, and a
   meta-interpreter for basic SEL in SEL.

Requires:     Quintus Prolog, C.
