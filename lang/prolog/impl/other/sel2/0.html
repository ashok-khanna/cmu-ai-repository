<H2>SEL2: Declarative set-processing language that generates

SEL (Subset-Equational Language) is a declarative set processing
language. Its main features are subset and equational program clauses,
pattern matching over sets, support for efficient iteration and
point-wise/incremental computation over sets, the ability to define
transitive closures through circular constraints, meta-programming and
simple higher-order programming, and a modest user-interface including
tracing. The language seems well-suited to a number of problems in
graph theory, program analysis, and discrete mathematics. The SEL
compiler is written in Quintus Prolog and the run-time system is
written in C. It generates WAM-like code, extended to deal with
set-matching, memoization, and the novel control structure of the
language.

The release comes with a user manual, bibliography of papers
(including .dvi files), several sample programs, and source code. 
Example programs include a miniature Eliza, higher-order and
meta-programming with apply and univ, permutations, quicksort, 
maxflow using min-cut, lazy evaluator for equations, shortest
distance in a directed graph, strongly connected components, and a
meta-interpreter for basic SEL in SEL.
