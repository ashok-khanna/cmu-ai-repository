PROSIT (Programming in SItuation Theory) is a programming language
similar to Prolog but based on Situation Theory instead of standard
first-order logic.  PROSIT is a declarative language, that is,
programs and data in PROSIT are all just sets of declarative elements
called infons.  Answering queries about these infons is the
fundamental action that the PROSIT interpreter carries out.  But
unlike Prolog, PROSIT contains mechanisms for dealing with the
``situations'' of Situation Theory.  Infons in PROSIT are not absolute
and global; they are local to situations.  Situations may be set up to
inherit information from other situations.  Situations may contain any
kind of information, including information about infons and
situations.  PROSIT also supports forward chaining, in which the
addition of new infons triggers the addition of other new infons,
creating a constant flow of information through the system.  And as in
Prolog, PROSIT can prove queries through backward chaining.
