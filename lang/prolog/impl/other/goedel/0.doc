Name:         Goedel

Summary:      Prolog-like language with improved declarative semantics.

Version:      1.4 (16-MAY-94); 1.3.27 (24-JAN-94)

Description: 

   GOEDEL is intended to be a declarative successor to Prolog.  The main
   design aim of Goedel is to have functionality and expressiveness
   similar to Prolog, but to have greatly improved declarative semantics
   compared with Prolog.  This improved declarative semantics has
   substantial benefits for program construction, compilation,
   verification, debugging, analysis, transformation, and so on.
   Considerable emphasis is placed on Goedel's meta-logical facilities,
   since this is where Prolog is most deficient.  In particular, Goedel
   has declarative replacements for Prolog's var, nonvar, assert, and
   retract.  Goedel is a strongly typed language, its type system being
   based on many-sorted logic with parametric polymorphism.

   Goedel's features include a module system, support for infinite
   precision integers, infinite precision rationals, and floating-point
   numbers, and support for processing of finite sets.  It can solve
   constraints over finite domains of integers and also linear rational
   constraints. It supports processing of finite sets.  It also
   has a flexible computation rule and a pruning operator which
   generalizes the commit of the concurrent logic programming languages.

   The release includes the Goedel system, the SAGE partial evaluator
   for Godel, a user manual, and 50 example programs. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Goedel must be compiled in SICStus Prolog 2.1 #6 or later; 
              Sparc and Linux executables are included in the distribution.
