# Survey:  Goedel Exploitation Study
#
# It would be greatly appreciated if you would complete this survey.
# Also please bring it to the attention of other people in your organisation 
# who might be interested.
#
# The logic programming language Goedel, developed at the University of 
# Bristol, is one of the results of the ESPRIT project COMPULOG.  The Goedel 
# system is being extended through the ESPRIT project COMPULOG 2.  This study, 
# being carried out in the framework of the VALUE programme from the European 
# Commission, aims at analyzing in detail the exploitation potential of the 
# Goedel language.  Thus the current Goedel developments might be re-oriented 
# towards a software product or be modified in order to fit in with the needs
# of users (from research and/or industrial domains). The current survey aims 
# to have precise feedback from Goedel users, and the opinion of potential 
# users.
# 
# A summary of the results will be available on request.
# If you need any further information do not hesitate to contact me:
# Mr. Eric Mino, SIGMA - Phone +33 93 65 22 20 - Fax +33 93 65 39 31
#
# Please send completed surveys to:
