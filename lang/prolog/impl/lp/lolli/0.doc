Name:         Lolli

Summary:      An interpreter for linear logic programming.

Version:      7.01 (1-DEC-92)

Description: 

   Lolli is an interpreter for logic programming based on intuitionist
   linear logic principles. Lolli, named for the linear logic implication
   operator "-o" called lollipop, is a full implementation of the
   language described in the Hodas & Miller paper "Logic Programming in a
   Fragment of Intuitionistic Linear Logic", though it differs a bit in
   syntax, and has several built-in extra-logical predicates and
   operators.

   The logic underlying Lolli can be viewed as a refinement of the the
   Hereditary Harrop formulas of Lambda-Prolog.  All the operators
   (though not the higher order unification) of Lambda-Prolog are
   supported, but with the addition of linear variations.  Thus a Lolli
   program distinguishes between clauses that can be used as many, or as
   few, times as desired, and those that must be used exactly once.

   These features have been used to provide a perspicuous, logical
   implementation of a number of example problems, including
   object-oriented programming with mutable state and information hiding,
   database update, and term rewriting.  Lolli has also been used as the
   setting for the development of a filler-gap dependency parser for
   natural language processing (see Hodas's JICSLP-92 paper).

   The preliminary implementation of Lolli is based on code written by
   Pfenning and Elliot for their paper "A Semi-Functional Implementation
   of a Higher-Order Logic Programming Language".

   The system is written in Standard ML of New Jersey, and the parser and
   lexer were built using the parser-generator (MLYACC) and
   lexical-analyzer-generator (MLLEX) distributed with that system.
   Though source files for the parser and lexer have been included, the
   parser and lexer have already been built, so you do not need access to
   the MLYACC or MLLEX.

Requires:     Standard ML of New Jersey (SML-NJ 0.75)

Ports:        Sparc and NeXT ready-made binaries are available.
