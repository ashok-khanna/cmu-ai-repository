Name:         clp(FD)

Summary:      Prolog and Constraints over Finite Domains and Booleans

Version:      2.2 (1-AUG-94); 2.1 (8-JUN-94)

Description: 

   clp(FD) is a constraint logic programming language over finite
   domains and booleans based on the wamcc Prolog compiler.
   clp(FD) provides several constraints "a la CHIP" on finite domains and
   booleans and some facilities for building new constraints. clp(FD) is
   4 times faster than CHIP v3.2 on average.  

   Examples include cryptarithms, the Ramsey problem, linear equations, and
   the N-Queens problem.

Requires:     GCC 2.4.5 or higher

Ports:        clp(FD) has been tested on Sparc workstations, DEC (Ultrix),
              Sony MIPS (R3000), and 386/486 PCs under linux. It should
              be easily ported to 32-bit machines with GCC.
