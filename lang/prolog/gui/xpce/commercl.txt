Dear Mark,

It has been suggested to me by Jan Wielemaker that you might be willing to
register details of a commercial version of XPCE called ProWindows 3 (XPCE)
in the CMU AI-library.

A description follows.

Is this appropriate for your system?

regards,


Simon

		Summary of ProWindows 3 (XPCE)


ProWindows3 (XPCE)
From A I International

Integrated high level Object-Oriented graphics system for QP
Overview

ProWindows3 is an object-oriented environment
used in cooperation with Quintus Prolog.
The combination provides a hybrid environment
with a small but powerful and flexible
interface. Although ProWindows3 provides many
general-purpose classes, it is primarily
designed to implement user-interfaces. This
version offers about 150 classes and defines
over 2600 methods.

General facility for user-defined object classes
is provided as part of ProWindows3. It
therefore is more than a library, becoming a
programming environment in its own right,
allowing the programmer to extend objects
classes, methods and behaviours.

ProWindows3 was originally developed by the
University of Amsterdam and called XPCE.
AI International has provided the interface
between Quintus Prolog and this product.  It is
initially available for the Sun SPARC workstation.
It is based on the addition of
object-oriented functionality to Quintus Prolog,
considerably simplifying the development
of interactive windowing and graphics sub-systems.
ProWindows3 is marketed and fully
supported worldwide by AI International Ltd,
principal European distributor for Quintus
products.
