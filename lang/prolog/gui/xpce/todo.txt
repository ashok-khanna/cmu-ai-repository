				XPCE ToDo List

[This list is just for minor problems.  More fundamental issues are
 in my head :-]

*) Bitmaps:
	1) Scaling
	2) Stencils

*) Realise user-defined executable classes?

*) Window ->grab_keyboard werkt niet zonder Window ->grab_pointer!

*) Allow for promoting graphical objects to dialog items, so the user
   can define new dialog items using graphical primitives.

*) Efficient constraint handling for spatials
	1) Trap updates for spatials at class graphical?

*) Communicate with host on CWD (current directory)

*) Clone/save:
	3) Relations (connection, constraint, hyper):
		- Internal <-> external relations

*) Creation: exploit `variable <-initial_value' (also function)
   Integrate with resource system.  Part of `object ->initialise'?

*) Improve consistency of functional group identifiers.

*) Print \t as space for xwn-draw.c text functions

*) Implement a proper `logical font-name' mechanism with a 
   proper interaction to the resource system.  One possible
   schema would be to allow for:

	send(Text, font, <LogicalFontName>)
   
   and define this font using Pce.Font.<LogicalFontName>.
   
*) Modify font conversion to accept raw X11 font-names.
	
*) Should @display be a function that evaluates to the
   default display if no event is in progress and the
   display the current events originates from otherwise?
