Summary:      Information about the XPCE object-oriented X-windows
              interface toolkit.

Version:      4.6.6

Description: 

   XPCE is an object-oriented X-window interface toolkit for symbolic
   programming languages (Prolog and Lisp), offering a high level of
   abstraction for communication with X11, Unix processes, Unix
   networking facilities (sockets) and Unix files. XPCE's built-in
   classes (about 150) are mostly written in C.  The XPCE/Prolog
   interface allows the user to create and manipulate instances of these
   classes.  The user can also create new XPCE classes from Prolog.
   XPCE's window related classes provide various styles of menus,
   primitive graphical objects, compound graphical objects and Emacs
   oriented programmable text manipulation windows. The distribution
   contains several demo programs, including a diagram drawing tool
   (PceDraw), an animation demo, an Epoch-like editor (PceEmacs), a graphical
   interface to Unix ispell, and an online hyper-text manual for XPCE
   itself (PceManual). 

   This directory contains copies of the license agreement,
   documentation, and a demo version. The non-demo versions (which
   include source code) require signing a license agreement and
   remitting a licensing fee to the University of Amsterdam (see info.txt). 

Requires:     

Ports:        SWI-Prolog, SICStus, Quintus; or Lucid CL and Harlequin CL
              X11 (R3, R4, or R5), Openwindows 2 and 3, OSF/Motif,
              XFree 1.2 and 1.3.

Origin:       ftp.swi.psy.uva.nl:pub/xpce/ [145.18.114.17].

              A demo version of XPCE/SWI-Prolog for Linux may be
              obtained in the linux/ subdirectory.

              The non-demo versions (for SWI-Prolog, SICStus Prolog,
              Lucid Common Lisp and LispWorks) require filling out a
              license and paying a fee (see info.txt).

      Explains how PCE may be connected to another (symbolic)
      programming language.  This connection is established through C.
