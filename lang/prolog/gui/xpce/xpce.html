****************************************************************
A) What is XPCE
****************************************************************

PCE is   an   object-oriented  library for   the  development  of user
interfaces,   meant to be    connected   to symbolic  languages.   The
development  of PCE started   in  1985.  Since  then,  various   major
releases have been designed  and implemented.  New   functionality was
guided by research into software architectures for complex interactive
systems.   PCE has been used  in  various large (ESPRIT) projects  and
projects at over 50 universities worldwide.

PCE is written in C and based on the X-window environment.  PCE can be
used interactively.   It  is, for example,  possible   to modify  user
interfaces on-the-fly.  PCE provides a rich set of predefined classes,
dealing with:

    * Windows
    * Graphical objects (boxes, lines, circles, bitmaps, text, ...)
    * Menu's (buttons, radio-buttons, pulldown/popup menus, ...)
    * Data representation (hash-tables, chains, name/value sheets, ...)
    * Programming PCE (classes, methods, instance-variables, ...)

It allows  for two complementary styles of  programming  UI's: one can
either  use the existing set of  classes  and objects  as a library or
refine  PCE's class hierarchy.   New PCE  classes  and  methods can be
created at runtime.  Methods can  be implemented using  PCE objects or
in  the symbolic  language    (Prolog  or  Lisp;  called  the   ``host
language'').

PCE  interfaces  to the host  language through a very small interface.
It can normally  be connected in  a matter   of  days to  any symbolic
programming environment, although access  to the sources/developers of
the  environment is  desirable  for  proper  interaction  between  the
debuggers of the host-language and PCE.

B) Languages and portability
****************************************************************

	1) To what languages has XPCE been connected?
	2) Which window environments?
	3) Which hardware/OS?

================================================================
1) To what languages has XPCE been connected?

	Prolog:		SICStus, Quintus and SWI-Prolog
	Lisp:		Lucid CommonLisp and Harlequin CommonLisp


================================================================
2) Which window environments?

	X11 and compatible: X11R3 .. X11R5, Openwindows 2 and 3,
	OSF/Motif, XFree 1.2 and 1.3.


================================================================
3) Which hardware/OS?

	XPCE is portable to any Unix system running X11 or a
	compatible window system with sufficiently large
	memory resources.  It currently compiles on:

		SunOs 4.1.x and 5.2.x (Solaris 2.2)
		AIX 3.2
		Linux 99pl7 and above (Free Unix for 386 PC's)
		Iris

	On all these systems, XPCE looks the same to the programmer
	and XPCE application user.  Saved object are portable
	(i.e. may be reloaded onto another system, even with
	different byte-order).

	XPCE requires about 4 MB memory (excluding Prolog or
	Lisp) for simple applications.

	Hardware is unimportant, but it doesn't like segmented
	memory (for PC's it requires true 386 mode).


****************************************************************
C) Installation problems
****************************************************************

	1) SWI-Prolog loops typing ^? to the terminal after typing ^D
	2) manpce/0 fails complaining about fonts
	3) when opening a window, XPCE complains about the authorisation


================================================================
1) SWI-Prolog loops typing ^? to the terminal after typing ^D (SunOs)

	You did not install the fixed include files for gcc.  See
	`make includes' in the GCC distribution.  Install these first.
	Then reinstall prolog and/or xpce.
	
================================================================
2) manpce/0 fails complaining about fonts

	The resource file Pce is not installed in a place where the
	X11 libraries look for it.  These places are:

		1) Your home directory
		2) Directories from the variable $XAPPLRESDIR
		3) /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults

	Install this `Pce' in one of these directories and ensure you
	have read access to it.

================================================================
3) when opening a window, XPCE complains about the authorisation

	Check your $DISPLAY variable.  XPCE/Prolog does not recogniser
	the -d display command-line switch.  Check permissions from
	the X-server, either using xhost or ~/.Xauthority.  Check
	whether you can start an xterm or other common X11 application
	from the same shell as you try to run XPCE.

D) Documentation
****************************************************************

	1) What documentation is available?
	2) How to obtain documentation?

	functionality, but still has may incomplete references,
	unclear descriptions and typos.  No printed version yet.

	# [5] ``Interfacing PCE to a Programming Language''
	Explains how PCE may be connected to another (symbolic)
	programming language.  This connection is established through C.
