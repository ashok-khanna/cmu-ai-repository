Some constraint benchmark problems

ASIbenchmarks...........devised by Brian Mayoh

Laurier (Artificial Intelligence 10:29-127, 1978) gives timing and
other results on 85 constraint problems.  Fifteen years later these
are still excellent test problems for students of constraint
programming but they are no longer sufficiently challenging to be
useful as benchmarks. Therefore we have devised a new family of
benchmarks. Although the benchmarks reflect a wide range of constraint
programming applications, they form a family because their underlying
constraint networks are variants of the 182 vertex graph G (given in
section 10).
