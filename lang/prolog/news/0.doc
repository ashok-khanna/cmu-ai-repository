Summary:      Prolog Newsgroup Archives

Description:

   This directory contains archives of many of the Prolog-related newsgroups.
   The new articles in each newsgroup are archived once a week, in a
   gzipped tar file of the form YY_MM_DD.tgz, where YY, MM, and DD are
   replaced with the year, month, and day, respectively. Most
   newsgroups begin with 94_09_14.tgz, which includes articles since
   23-JUL-94, but some may include articles before that.
