Name:         Zebu

Summary:      A LALR(1) parser generator for Scheme.

Version:      0.9

Description: 

   Zebu 0.9 is an LALR(1) parser generator for Scheme. Documentation
   is included in the distribution.

   Zebu reads grammar files that contain the description of a language as
   well as the actions to be taken as the language is parsed.  The
   language is described by production rules, while the actions are
   described by associated lambda expressions.  Zebu uses the grammar
   files to generate parse table files that describe an LR parsing
   machine to process the specified language. The Zebu parser driver uses
   the parse table file to process the specified language.

Requires:     

Ports:        Works with PC-Scheme from TI and MIT C-Scheme 6.2
