<H2>XScheme: Graphical Scheme debugger</H2>
<pre>

<listing>
XScheme is a graphical Scheme debugger based on STk (Scheme Tk
interface) and was developed for cs169 Software Engineering class of
1994 at University of California at Berkeley.

The features of this release include:

  *  Breakpoints on any subexpression of a closure -- stop evaluation
     before that subexpression is evaluated.  Set break, remove break
     enable/disable break operations can be done both interactively from
     Break point manager window, Expression viewer or scheme prompt, as
     well as from code.

  *  Self-evaluating watch expressions, that provide monitoring of 
     arbitrary expressions with various scope and evaluation options.

  *  Abitily to install custom viewers that provide a specialized
     view at any scheme data. These viewers must confirm to a
     common interface and can be attached to any watch expression
     so the value of that watch expression is displayed with this
     specified viewer. 

  *  A number of viewer is provided with this release:

       -  expression viewer, shows data in textual notation, pretty
                             printed with color coded keywords.

       -  Box-n-Pointer Viewer, shows data in Box and Pointer
                             notation, with a cons cell represented
                             as a box with two pointers for car and cdr.

       -  Environment Viewer, a specialized viewer to display the
                             current binings of any given
                             environment, and its parent environments.

  *  Evaluation Monitor: provides display of the location of
     evaluation when a breakpoint occurs and displays current
     local bindings at that point. 

  *  Help system. It provides a set of indexed entries that can be
     expanded easily by loading a new text module and regestering.
     Help screens can use custom fonts, sizes and formatting. No
     colors are supported yet, but can be added with minimum effort.
