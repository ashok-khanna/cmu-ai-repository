Summary:      Implementation of TCP and UDP sockets for Scheme->C.

Version:      13-MAY-91

Description: 

   This is a Scheme->C hack that allows you to create and maintain TCP
   and UDP sockets. It has been used to implement a simple distributed
   database and converse with a server over a TCP connection.  There is
   also a facility (pack/unpack) for transmitting simple Scheme objects
   (cons nodes, string, symbol and integer) over socket connections.  The
   packing/unpacking routines are probably byte order dependent, but they
   will probably work for big-endian architectures.
