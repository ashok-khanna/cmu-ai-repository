Summary:      A Chez Scheme interface to the Sybase database.

Version:      1.0 (25-MAY-94)

Description:  

   This directory contains a Chez Scheme interface to the Sybase database.

   It uses the Chez Scheme foreign function interface to provide a
   high-level Scheme interface to the Sybase db-lib (the API to the
   Sybase database). Most of the db-lib calls and datatypes are
   supported, with the possible exception of spotty support for text and
   image data. There also isn't any Scheme support for the datetime
   datatype -- dates and times must be supplied to SQL as a string and
   returned to Scheme in a CONVERT()ed column as a string.  There is
   no Scheme datetime datatype. 

Requires:     Chez-Scheme, Sybase db-lib

Ports:        Tested on a VAX under VMS.
