Summary:      Rapid Prototyping/Specification Language with Scheme interface

Version:      1.4 (23-SEP-94)

Description: 

   Proxy is an interpreter for a rapid prototyping/specification language
   with C/C++ like syntax based on modelling software using data
   structures such as sets, maps, sequences, structures and objects. It
   allows the developer to make incremental changes to a design and test
   them immediately. Proxy is written in Scheme, provides a Scheme
   interface, and currently runs under MS-DOS. New in version 1.4 is a
   non-preemptive CSP-like multi-tasking facility. 

   The distribution includes the interpreter, documentation and examples. 

   Proxy is implemented in XScheme. A PC Scheme port is available from
   the author.
