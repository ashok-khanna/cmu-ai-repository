ANNOUNCING Proxy 1.4
--------------------------------------
Proxy is an interpreter dor a rapid prototyping/specification language with
C/C++ like syntax based on modelling software using data structures such as
sets, maps, sequences, structures and objectss. It allows the developer to
make incremental changes to a design and test them immediately. Proxy is
written in Scheme, provides a Scheme interface, and currently runs under
MS-DOS. It is available by anonymous ftp from

   ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/scm/proxy.zip

proxy.zip contains the interpreter, documentation and examples. New in
version 1.4 is a non-preemptive CSP-like multi-tasking facility.
