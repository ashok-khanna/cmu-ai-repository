Summary:      Pattern Matching and Data Definition facility for Scheme

Version:      1.07 (28-FEB-94)

Description: 

   This package provides a pattern matching facility for Scheme, similar
   to the pattern matching facilities of Haskell, Miranda, and ML.
   Pattern matching provides a convenient syntax for destructuring
   complicated list, and vector structures.  The package also provides a
   data definition facility for defining new forms of structured data.
   Documentation is included in the distribution.

Ports:        This package has been tested with SCM and should run on
              any system with SLIB. There is also a separate Chez
              Scheme version.
