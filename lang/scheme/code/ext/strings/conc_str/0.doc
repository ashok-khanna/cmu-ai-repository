Summary:      Strings for efficient concatenation.

Version:      1.8 (22-SEP-92)

Description: 

   CONC-STRING is a form of string that supports efficient concatenation.
   This allows purely functional code to be written without the overhead
   associated with the append operation in conventional strings.  Of
   course, there is no such thing as a free lunch, this efficiency is
   achieved by removing the worst case O(1) time for accessing a
   character in the string. Conc-strings are implemented as binary
   trees with some redundant information.
