Summary:      Scheme code to emulate FUTURE and PCALL.

Version:      1.1 (15-JAN-92)

Description: 

   PCALL is a multi-threaded kernel that provides a pcall facility, an
   implementation of futures and suspensions, and a high-level control
   operator that allows the definition of partial continuations.

Requires:     

Ports:        Tested in MacScheme and Scheme->C.
