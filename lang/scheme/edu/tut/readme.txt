This directory contains source code for various data structures and
algorithms that are covered in Tampere University of Technology in the
course 81120 "Data Structures and Algorithms".

Most the material was written by Juha Heinanen, a former professor in
our department. He introduced Scheme to this course (then called
"Advanced Course in Programming") in 1988. I was his teaching
assistant for a couple of years, and when he resigned in 1990, I
inherited the course from him, with all the material he had written. I
am not certain wether he really wrote all the algorithms, or got them
from someone, but I've attributed them to him anyway.  There are also
some algorithms I have written myself.

Most of the code is poorly if at all commented. This is mostly because
in the course it is supplemented with the material explaining the
algorithms etc. Unfortunately it is all in Finnish. I would really
like to see this collection grow into something that would profit
other people besides myself, so I'm open to suggestions. Please note
that these impelmentations are used for teaching the algorithms, so
clarity is preferred over efficiency if the choice has to be made.

Please don't hesitate to send comments. suggestions etc. to me!
