Subject: Scheme standard approved
Reply-To: chaynes@cs.indiana.edu

The fifth draft of the "Standard for the Scheme Programming Language,"
P1178/D5, has been approved by the IEEE Standards Board (subject to
resolution of a couple of minor editorial and administrative matters,
which will be done in the next few days).

The Scheme standard will be available in published form from the IEEE
Standards Office (for about $50) in a couple of months or so.  I will
post exact ordering information at that time.  Until then, copies of
the draft may be obtained by writing

	Michael Philips
	IEEE Standards Office
	445 Hoes Lane
	P.O. Box 1331
	Piscataway, NJ 08855

or calling 201-562-3800.  The draft costs $27 ($21.60 for IEEE members)
and payment may be made by check or credit card.  In accordance with
IEEE policy, drafts of the standard will no longer be distributed by
MIT and Indiana University.

The Working Group on Scheme, IEEE/MSC/P1178, now ceases to exist.  It
will be reconstituted to revise or reaffirm the standard when the need
is felt (not more than five years from now).

Special acknowledgment is due the standard and ballotting response
editors, Chris Hanson, James S. Miller, David H. Bartley, and John D.
Ramsdell.  The rapid progress of the Scheme standard working group and
the quality of the final standard is due in large measure to the
efforts of the "Revised^n Report on Scheme" authors and their editors,
William Clinger and Jonathan Rees.
