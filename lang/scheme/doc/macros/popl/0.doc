Name:         Lexically-scoped macros

Summary:      POPL-91 paper and LP-93 re-exposition.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains papers related to lexically-scoped macros.
   It includes William Clinger and Jonathan Rees's POPL-91 paper [5],
   which describes a modified form of Kohlbecker's algorithm [9,10] for
   reliably hygienic (capture-free) macro expansion in block-structured
   languages. Also included is Jonathan Rees's 1993 Lisp Pointers paper
   [11], which gives a more practical exposition of the algorithm given
   in the POPL paper.
