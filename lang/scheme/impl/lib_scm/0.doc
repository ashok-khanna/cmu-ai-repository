Name:         libscheme

Summary:      C library implementing R4RS Scheme.

Version:      0.4 (20-SEP-94)

Description: 

   libscheme is a C library implementing Scheme as described in R4RS.  It
   is easily integrated into a C program as a command interpreter or
   extension language, and is easily extended in C with new primitive
   types, primitive functions and syntax.  It should be portable to most
   machines with an ANSI C compiler.

Requires:
