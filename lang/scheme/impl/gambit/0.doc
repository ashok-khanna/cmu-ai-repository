Package:      lang/scheme/impl/gambit/

Name:         Gambit Scheme

Summary:      An optimizing Scheme compiler.

Version:      2.0 (5-FEB-93)

Description: 

   Gambit is an optimizing Scheme compiler/system. It conforms to the
   IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE P1178) and the Revised^4 Report on Scheme
   (R4RS). The system supports the whole numeric tower (i.e. integer,
   rational, real and complex numbers). It also has several extensions to
   the standards including: weak pairs, string ports, property lists,
   futures, pretty printer, debugger, compiler and multitasking.  The
   distribution contains the interpreter and optimizing native code
   compiler and all the sources required to build the system (the sources
   for MacGambit are for THINK-C 5.0). MacGambit's specific features
   include: a Scheme interface to several Toolbox routines (mostly
   QuickDraw), a drawing window for simple graphics, an online help
   system containing R4RS and a Scheme oriented editor with an emacs
   compatibility mode.

Requires:     

Ports:        Gambit runs on M680x0 based machines only, including
              Sun3, Apollo, HP9000/3xx, BBN GP1000 multiprocessor,
              Amiga, NeXT, and the Apple Macintosh. On the Macintosh
              there is both a UNIX version (under A/UX) and a
              System/Finder application.
