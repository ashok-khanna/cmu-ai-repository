Package:      lang/scheme/impl/bigloo/

Name:         Bigloo

Summary:      A Scheme to C compiler and interpreter

Version:      Bigloo 1.7 (30-JAN-95); Camloo 0.2 (9-JUN-94)

Description: 

   BIGLOO is a Scheme interpreter and compiler. It conforms to the
   IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE P1178) with some extensions, such as
   regular expression parsing (RGC), a lexical analyzer generator, a full
   foreign function interface, and a pattern matching compiler.  Bigloo
   can also compile modules written in Caml (an ML dialect), letting you
   mix Scheme, ML, and C.  Object-oriented programming is provided by
   Meroon v3. The main goal of Bigloo is to deliver small and fast stand
   alone applications.  Bigloo produces ANSI C and hence should be easy
   to port. 

   Also included is Camloo, a package that allows Bigloo to compile
   Caml, and BCL, an optimizing Caml Light compiler for Unix machines.

Requires:     

Ports:        Sparc (1, 2, 10), Sony News (MIPS R3000), DecStation 3100, 
              DEC Station Alpha, IRIS Indigo (MIPS R3000), Sun3/60 (68k), 
              HP PA (730), and PC-486 (linux). Should be easily ported to 
              32 bit Unix machines and should run on NeXT 68K and IBM
              RS-6000 (AIX).
