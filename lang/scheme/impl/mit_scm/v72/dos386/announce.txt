Well, it's ready (we think and hope).

To get it, use anonymous ftp to altdorf.ai.mit.edu (ip address 18.43.0.152).
Look in archive/scheme-7.2/DOS-386.  Please remember to use ftp in
BINARY mode.

Read the ALPHA.TXT file for a description of what's there so you can
decide what you want and what you don't.

Each file appears twice, at top-level of the DOS-386 directory and
inside one of the subdirectories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

Each of the subdirectories contains less than 1.4MB of data, so they
can be copied into high-density 3.5" floppies.

Unfortunately a few of them contain more than 1.2MB, so they cannot be
copied into high-density 5.25" floppies.

If you do not have convenient access to the internet, and would like
floppies instead, please send mail to
info-cscheme-dos-request@zurich.ai.mit.edu .
We'll arrange something according to demand, but we will probably ask
you for some money as a nuisance charge (just as we do for our Unix
distributions).

Bugs, problems, etc. should be reported to
bug-cscheme-dos@zurich.ai.mit.edu .
