    MacSCM -- Macintosh support library for the scm Scheme interpreter


(*NOTE: some parts of this document were taken from the README file for
x-scm)

WHAT IS MacSCM?

This is MacSCM version 1.0.

MacSCM is similar to x-scm (a SCM package for X-Windows) in that it is a
bolt-on accessory for the "scm" Scheme interpreter that provides a way to
build Macintosh applications.

To build MacSCM, you must first obtain and successfully build scm, version
scm4e0 or later.  Thanks to some hooks added to scm by its author, Aubrey
Jaffer, x-scm requires no modifications whatsoever to scm itself.

OWNERSHIP

MacSCM has been placed into the public domain by myself (Kevin Scott
Kunzelman).  This means that you can copy it, sell it, modify it, all
without any restrictions.

FUTURE

I do not plan to have any long-term commitments to MacSCM; this is just a
project that I started.	 In fact, one of the reasons that I put this into
the public domain is that right now I cannot afford to spend any more time
on little side projects like these.  Thus, I am hoping that someone
interested will pick this stuff up and take over.
