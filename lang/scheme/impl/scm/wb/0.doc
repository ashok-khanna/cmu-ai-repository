Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scm/wb/

Name:         WB

Summary:      Database package which may be used with SCM.

Version:      1a2

Description: 

   WB is a disk based, sorted associative array (B-tree) C library. These
   associative arrays consist of variable length (less that 256 bytes)
   keys and values.  

   Using WB, large databases can be created and managed from SCM. 

   Basic operations are creation, destruction, opening and closing of 
   diskfiles and arrays, insertion, deletion, retrieval, successor, and
   predecessor (with respect to dictionary order of keys).  Functional
   application of find-next, deletion, and modification over a range of
   consecutive key values is supported. Multiple associative arrays
   can be stored in one disk file. Simultaneous access to multiple
   disk files is supported.  A structure checker, garbage collector
   are included.  A repair program and ram-disk type file (for
   temporary structures) are in development. The current WB
   implementation has a file size limit of 2^32 * block size (default
   2048) = 2^43 bytes (8796 Gbytes). WB does its own memory and disk
   management.
