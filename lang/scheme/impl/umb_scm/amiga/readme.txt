Short: Amiga Port of UMB Scheme 2.5
Type: dev/lang
Uploader: duester@wpts0.physik.uni-wuppertal.de

This is a Port of UMB Scheme 2.5 to the Amiga. Scheme is a Lisp-like
programming language with procedures as first class data, static scoping etc.
UMB Scheme 2.5 supports long integers of (almost) arbitrary length.

It was compiled using DICE C 2.07.54R with the dynamic stack feature of DICE.
The interpreter will allocate stack space automatically.

Please read the Release Notes in scheme.texinfo (.dvi file included).
Please read the README file.

I have changed the directory structure, source files are now in the
directory 'src'.

This software is provided with no warranty. Use on your own risk.

    ( I am interested in scheme code for symbolic mathematics,
      like algebraic manipulations of formulae, differentiation,
      integration, simplification ... If you have anything in
      this direction, contact me. Thank you ! )
