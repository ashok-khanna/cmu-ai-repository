Package:      lang/scheme/util/slatex/

Name:         SLaTeX

Summary:      Lets you to include Scheme/Lisp code `as is' in LaTeX/TeX.

Version:      2.3 (10-AUG-94); 2.2 (20-JAN-94)
              

Description: 

   SLaTeX is a R4RS-compliant Scheme program that allows you to write
   program code "as is" in your LaTeX or TeX source.  It is particularly
   geared to the programming languages Scheme and Common Lisp. The
   formatting of the code includes assigning appropriate fonts to the
   various tokens in the code (keywords, variables, constants, data), at
   the same time retaining the proper indentation when going to the
   non-monospace (non-typewriter) provided by TeX.  SLaTeX comes with two
   databases that recognize the standard keywords/variables/constants of
   Scheme and Common Lisp respectively.  These can be modified by the
   user using easy TeX commands.  In addition, the user can inform SLaTeX
   to typeset arbitrary identifiers as specially suited TeX expressions
   (i.e., beyond just fonting them).  

Requires:     

Ports:        R4RS-compliant. Tested in Chez Scheme, Common Lisp, 
              MIT C Scheme, Elk, Scheme->C, SCM and UMB Scheme on Unix,
              and MIT C Scheme and SCM on MSDOS.
