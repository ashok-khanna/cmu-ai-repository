Package:      lang/scheme/oop/tinyclos/

Name:         TinyCLOS

Summary:      Subset of CLOS in Scheme, with metaobject protocol.

Version:      1.2 (2-DEC-92)

Description: 

   Tiny CLOS is a Scheme implementation of a `kernelized' CLOS, with a
   metaobject protocol. The implementation is even simpler than the
   simple CLOS found in `The Art of the Metaobject Protocol,' weighing in
   at around 850 lines of code, including (some) comments and
   documentation. 

Requires:     

Ports:        Tiny CLOS runs in MIT Scheme 11.74 and should run with
              only minor modifications in other Schemes as well.
