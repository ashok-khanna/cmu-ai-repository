Summary:      Yet Another Scheme Object System

Version:      2-SEP-92

Description: 

   YASOS (Yet Another Scheme Object System) is fairly functional in style
   and uses delegation.  The implementation includes multiple inheritance
   and "send to super" and is much smaller than class-based OO systems.
   Includes sample collection operations over lists, vectors, strings,
   and simple tables.

   YASOS is also included as part of SLIB.
