   If you will be transferring compressed files, be sure to
   type the "binary" command before retrieving the files. The
   "get" command is used to get a single file, and "mget" to
   retrieve multiple files using wildcards.  If you're using
   the "mget" command, you might want to turn off prompting
   first by using the "prompt" command.
   The Lisp Utilities Repository is kept in the Andrew File
   System (AFS) directory
   /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/scheme/
   and its subdirectories. If your site runs AFS, you can
   just cd to this directory and copy the files directly.
   (The FTP location given above is just a link to the AFS
   directory.)
   Further information about AFS can be obtained by

Welcome to the Scheme Repository.

The Scheme Repository at CMU is part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence
Repository. The goal of the Scheme Repository is to collect files and
programs of general interest to Scheme programmers. Information
files include the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) postings for the
comp.lang.scheme newsgroup and copies of the RnRS standards for scheme.

Thanks to Ozan S. Yigit, creator of the Internet Scheme Repository,
for assistance in gathering materials for the Scheme section of the
CMU AI Repository.

This is NOT a precise mirror of the Internet Scheme Repository. Some
of the materials have been relocated to more appropriate locations in
the AI Repository. We also have some additional materials not
currently present in the Internet Scheme Repository, and changed the
organization significantly.

If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
signify your agreement to these conditions.

To contribute files to the repository, first see section [7] of the
readme.txt file. Then send mail to ai+scheme@cs.cmu.edu. If
possible, please put the files in ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/new/.
