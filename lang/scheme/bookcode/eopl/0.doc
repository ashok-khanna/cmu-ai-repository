Description: 

   This directory contains source code for all the Scheme programs and
   Scheme program fragments in the book

      Daniel P. Friedman, Mitchell Wand, and Christopher T. Haynes,
      "Essentials of Programming Languages", MIT Press/McGraw-Hill, 1992.
      536 pages, ISBN 0-262-06145-7.

   EOPL teaches fundamental concepts of programming language design by
   using small interpreters as examples. The book covers most of the
   features of Scheme. It includes a discussion of parameter passing
   techniques, object oriented languages, and techniques for transforming
   interpreters to allow their implementation in terms of any low-level
   language.  Also discussed are scanners, parsers, and the derivation of
   a compiler and virtual machine from an interpreter.
