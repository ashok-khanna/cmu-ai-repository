<H2><A NAME=SECTION001185000000000000000>7.8.5. The ``Program Feature''</A></H2>
<P>
Lisp implementations since Lisp 1.5 have had what was originally
called ``the program feature,'' as if it were impossible to write
programs without it!  The <tt>prog</tt> construct allows one to
write in an Algol-like or Fortran-like statement-oriented
style, using <tt>go</tt> statements that can refer to tags in the
body of the <tt>prog</tt>.  Modern Lisp programming style tends to use
<tt>prog</tt> rather infrequently.  The various iteration constructs,
such as <tt>do</tt>, have bodies with the characteristics of a <tt>prog</tt>.
(However, the ability to use <tt>go</tt> statements within iteration
constructs is very seldom called upon in practice.)
<P>
Three distinct operations are performed by <tt>prog</tt>: it binds local variables,
it permits use of the <tt>return</tt> statement, and it permits use of the <tt>go</tt>
statement.
In Common Lisp, these three operations have been separated into three
distinct constructs: <tt>let</tt>, <tt>block</tt>, and <tt>tagbody</tt>.
These three constructs may be used independently as building blocks
for other types of constructs.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>tagbody</tt> <tt>{<i>tag</i></tt> <tt>|</tt> <tt><i>statement</i>}*</tt><P>The part of a <tt>tagbody</tt> after the variable list is called the <i>body</i>.
An item in the body may be a symbol or an integer, in which case it is called a
<i>tag</i>, or an item in the body may be a list, in which case it is called a 
<i>statement</i>.
<P>
Each element of the body is processed from left to right.
A <i>tag</i> is ignored; a <i>statement</i>
is evaluated, and its results are discarded.  If the end of the body
is reached, the <tt>tagbody</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
If <tt>(go <i>tag</i>)</tt> is evaluated, control jumps to the part of the body
labelled with the <i>tag</i>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> The ``computed <tt>go</tt>'' feature of MacLisp is not
supported.  The syntax of a computed <tt>go</tt> is idiosyncratic,
and the feature is not supported by Lisp Machine Lisp, NIL (New Implementation of Lisp), or Interlisp.
The computed <tt>go</tt> has been infrequently used in MacLisp anyway
and is easily simulated with no loss of
efficiency by using a <tt>case</tt> statement each of whose
clauses performs a (non-computed) <tt>go</tt>.
<hr>
<P>
The scope of the tags established by a <tt>tagbody</tt> is lexical,
and the extent is dynamic.  Once a <tt>tagbody</tt> construct has
been exited, it is no longer legal to <tt>go</tt> to a <i>tag</i> in its body.
It is permissible for a <tt>go</tt> to jump to a <tt>tagbody</tt> that is not
the innermost <tt>tagbody</tt> construct containing that <tt>go</tt>;
the tags established by a <tt>tagbody</tt> will only shadow other tags
of like name.
<P>
The lexical scoping of the <tt>go</tt> targets named by tags is
fully general and has consequences that may be surprising
to users and implementors of other Lisp systems.
For example, the <tt>go</tt> in the following example actually does
work in Common Lisp as one might expect:
<P><pre>
(tagbody 
   (catch 'stuff 
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (numberp x) 
                                (hairyfun x) 
                                (go lose))) 
              items)) 
   (return) 
 lose 
   (error &quot;I lost big!&quot;))
</pre><P>
Depending on the situation, a <tt>go</tt> in Common Lisp does not necessarily
correspond to a simple machine ``jump'' instruction.
A <tt>go</tt> can break up catchers if necessary to get
to the target.  It is possible for a ``closure'' created by <tt>function</tt> for
a lambda-expression to refer to a <tt>go</tt> target as long as the tag
is lexically apparent.  See chapter <A HREF="node43.html#SCOPE">3</A> for an elaborate
example of this.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
There are some holes in this specification (and that of <tt>go</tt>) that
leave some room for interpretation.  For example, there is no explicit
prohibition against the same tag appearing more than once in the same
<tt>tagbody</tt> body.  Every implementation I know of will complain
in the compiler, if not in the interpreter, if there is a <tt>go</tt> to
such a duplicated tag; but some implementors take the position
that duplicate tags are permitted provided there is no <tt>go</tt> to
such a tag.  (``If a tree falls in the forest, and there is no one
there to hear it, then no one needs to yell `Timber!''')
Also, some implementations allow objects other than symbols, integers,
and lists in the body and typically ignore them.
Consequently,
some programmers use redundant tags such as <tt>-</tt> for formatting purposes,
and strings as comments:
<P><pre>
(defun dining-philosopher (j) 
  (tagbody - 
   think   (unless (hungry) (go think)) 
           - 
           &quot;Can't eat without chopsticks.&quot; 
           (snatch (chopstick j)) 
           (snatch (chopstick (mod (+ j 1) 5))) 
           - 
   eat     (when (hungry) 
             (mapc #'gobble-down 
                   '(twice-cooked-pork kung-pao-chi-ding 
                     wu-dip-har orange-flavor-beef 
                     two-side-yellow-noodles twinkies)) 
             (go eat)) 
           - 
           &quot;Can't think with my neighbors' stomachs rumbling.&quot; 
           (relinquish (chopstick j)) 
           (relinquish (chopstick (mod (+ j 1) 5))) 
           - 
           (if (happy) (go think) 
               (become insurance-salesman))))
</pre><P>
In certain implementations of Common Lisp they get away with it.
Others abhor what they view as an abuse of unintended ambiguity
in the language specification.  For maximum portability, I advise
users to steer clear of these issues.  Similarly, it is best
to avoid using <tt>nil</tt> as a tag, even though it is a symbol, because
a few implementations treat <tt>nil</tt> as a list to be executed.
To be extra careful, avoid calling from within a <tt>tagbody</tt>
a macro whose expansion might not be a non-<tt>nil</tt> list; wrap such a 
call in <tt>(progn ...)</tt>, or rewrite the macro to return <tt>(progn ...)</tt>
if possible.

prog ({<i>var</i> | (<i>var</i> [<i>init</i>])}*) {<i>declaration</i>}* {<i>tag</i> | <i>statement</i>}* 
prog* ({<i>var</i> | (<i>var</i> [<i>init</i>])}*) {<i>declaration</i>}* {<i>tag</i> | <i>statement</i>}*
</pre>
<P>The <tt>prog</tt> construct is a synthesis of <tt>let</tt>, <tt>block</tt>,
and <tt>tagbody</tt>, allowing bound variables and the use of <tt>return</tt> and <tt>go</tt>
within a single construct.  A typical <tt>prog</tt> construct looks like this:
<P><pre>
(prog (<i>var1</i> <i>var2</i> (<i>var3</i> <i>init3</i>) <i>var4</i> (<i>var5</i> <i>init5</i>)) 
      {<i>declaration</i>}*
      <i>statement1</i> 
 <i>tag1</i> 
      <i>statement2</i> 
      <i>statement3</i> 
      <i>statement4</i> 
 <i>tag2</i> 
      <i>statement5</i> 
      ... 
      )
</pre><P>
The list after the keyword <tt>prog</tt> is a set of specifications for binding
<i>var1</i>, <i>var2</i>, etc.,
which are temporary variables bound locally to the <tt>prog</tt>.
This list is processed exactly as the list in a <tt>let</tt> statement:
first all the <i>init</i> forms are evaluated from left to right
(where <tt>nil</tt> is used for
any omitted <i>init</i> form), and then the variables are all bound in
parallel to the respective results.
Any <i>declaration</i> appearing in the <tt>prog</tt> is used as if appearing
at the top of the <tt>let</tt> body.
<P>
The body of the <tt>prog</tt> is executed as if it were a <tt>tagbody</tt>
construct; the <tt>go</tt> statement may be used to transfer control
to a <i>tag</i>.
<P>
A <tt>prog</tt> implicitly establishes a <tt>block</tt> named <tt>nil</tt> around
the entire <tt>prog</tt> construct, so that <tt>return</tt> may be used
at any time to exit from the <tt>prog</tt> construct.
<P>
Here is a fine example of what can be done with <tt>prog</tt>:
<P><pre>
(defun king-of-confusion (w) 
  &quot;Take a cons of two lists and make a list of conses. 
   Think of this function as being like a zipper.&quot; 
  (prog (x y z)     ;Initialize <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, <tt>z</tt> to <tt>nil</tt> 
        (setq y (car w) z (cdr w)) 
   loop 
        (cond ((null y) (return x)) 
              ((null z) (go err))) 
   rejoin 
        (setq x (cons (cons (car y) (car z)) x)) 
        (setq y (cdr y) z (cdr z)) 
        (go loop) 
   err 
        (cerror &quot;Will self-pair extraneous items&quot; 
                &quot;Mismatch - gleep!   S&quot; y) 
        (setq z y) 
        (go rejoin)))
</pre><P>
which is accomplished somewhat more perspicuously by
<P><pre>
(defun prince-of-clarity (w) 
  &quot;Take a cons of two lists and make a list of conses. 
   Think of this function as being like a zipper.&quot; 
  (do ((y (car w) (cdr y)) 
       (z (cdr w) (cdr z)) 
       (x '<tt>()</tt> (cons (cons (car y) (car z)) x))) 
      ((null y) x) 
    (when (null z) 
      (cerror &quot;Will self-pair extraneous items&quot; 
              &quot;Mismatch - gleep!   S&quot; y) 
      (setq z y))))
</pre><P>
<P>
The <tt>prog</tt> construct may be explained in terms of the simpler
constructs <tt>block</tt>, <tt>let</tt>, and <tt>tagbody</tt> as
follows:
<P><pre>
(prog <i>variable-list</i> {<i>declaration</i>}* . <i>body</i>) 
   == (block nil (let <i>variable-list</i> {<i>declaration</i>}* (tagbody . <i>body</i>)))
</pre><P>
<P>
The <tt>prog*</tt> special form is almost the same as <tt>prog</tt>.  The only
difference is that the binding and initialization of the temporary
variables is done <i>sequentially</i>, so that the <i>init</i> form for each
one can use the values of previous ones.
Therefore <tt>prog*</tt> is to <tt>prog</tt> as <tt>let*</tt> is to <tt>let</tt>.
For example,
<P><pre>
(prog* ((y z) (x (car y))) 
       (return x))
</pre><P>
returns the <i>car</i> of the value of <tt>z</tt>.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
I haven't seen <tt>prog</tt> used very much in the last several years.
Apparently splitting it into functional constituents
(<tt>let</tt>, <tt>block</tt>, <tt>tagbody</tt>) has been a success.  Common Lisp
programmers now tend to use whichever specific construct is appropriate.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>go</tt> <tt><i>tag</i></tt><P>The <tt>(go <i>tag</i>)</tt> special form is used to do a ``go to'' within
a <tt>tagbody</tt> construct.  The <i>tag</i> must be a symbol or an integer;
the <i>tag</i> is not evaluated.
<tt>go</tt> transfers control to the point in the body labelled by a
tag <tt>eql</tt> to the one given.  If there is no such tag in the body, the
bodies of lexically containing <tt>tagbody</tt> constructs
(if any) are examined as well.
It is an error if there is no matching tag lexically visible
to the point of the <tt>go</tt>.
<P>
The <tt>go</tt> form does not ever return a value.
<P>
As a matter of style, it is recommended that the user think twice before
using a <tt>go</tt>.  Most purposes of <tt>go</tt> can be accomplished with one of
the iteration primitives, nested conditional forms, or
<tt>return-from</tt>.  If the use of <tt>go</tt> seems to be unavoidable,
perhaps the control structure implemented by <tt>go</tt> should be packaged
as a macro definition.
