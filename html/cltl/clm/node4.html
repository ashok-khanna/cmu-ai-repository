Some contributions were relatively small; others involved enormous
expenditures of effort and great dedication.  A few of the contributors
served more as worthy adversaries than as benefactors (and do not
necessarily endorse the final design reported here),
but their pointed criticisms were just as important to the polishing of Common Lisp
as all the positively phrased suggestions.
All of the people named above were helpful in one way or another,
and I am grateful for the interest and spirit of cooperation
that allowed most decisions to be made by consensus after due discussion.
<P>
Considerable encouragement and moral support were also provided by:

I am very grateful to each of them.

Jan Zubkoff of Carnegie-Mellon University
provided a great deal of organization,
secretarial support, and unfailing good cheer in the face of adversity.

The development of Common Lisp would most probably not have been possible
without the electronic message system provided by the ARPANET.
Design decisions were made on several hundred distinct points, for the
most part by consensus, and by simple majority vote when necessary.
Except for two one-day face-to-face meetings, all of the language design
and discussion was done through the ARPANET message system, which
permitted effortless dissemination of messages to dozens of people, and
several interchanges per day.  The message system also provided
automatic archiving of the entire discussion, which has proved
invaluable in the preparation of this reference manual.  Over the course
of thirty months, approximately 3000 messages were sent (an average of
three per day), ranging in length from one line to twenty pages.
Assuming 5000 characters per printed page of text, the entire
discussion totaled about 1100 pages.  It would have been substantially
more difficult to have conducted this discussion by any other means,
and would have required much more time.
<P>
The ideas in Common Lisp have come from many sources and been polished by
much discussion.  I am responsible for the form of this
book, and for any errors or inconsistencies that may remain;
but the credit for the design and support of Common Lisp lies with
the individuals named above, each of whom has made significant
contributions.
<P>
The organization and content
of this book were inspired in large part by the
<i>MacLISP Reference Manual</i> by David A. Moon and others [<A HREF="node368.html#MOONUAL">33</A>],
and by the <i>LISP Machine Manual</i> (fourth edition)
by Daniel Weinreb and David Moon [<A HREF="node368.html#BLUELISPM">55</A>],
which in turn acknowledges the efforts of Richard Stallman, Mike McMahon,
Alan Bawden, Glenn Burke, and ``many people too numerous to list.''
<P>
I thank Phyllis Keenan, Chase Duffy,
Virginia Anderson,
John Osborn,
and Jonathan Baker of Digital Press for their
help in preparing this book for publication.
Jane Blake did an admirable job of copy-editing.
James Gibson and Katherine Downs of Waldman Graphics were most cooperative
in typesetting this book from my on-line manuscript files.
<P>
I am grateful to Carnegie-Mellon University and to
Tartan Laboratories Incorporated for supporting me in the writing
of this book over the last three years.
<P>
Part of the work on this book was
done in conjunction with the Carnegie-Mellon University Spice Project,
an effort to construct an advanced scientific software development
environment for personal computers.
The Spice Project is
supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Department   
of Defense, ARPA Order 3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics   
Laboratory under contract F33615-78-C-1551.  The views   
and conclusions contained in this book are those of the author
and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies,   
either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research   
Projects Agency or the U.S. Government.
<P>
Most of the writing of this book took place between
midnight and 5 A.M.  I am grateful to Barbara, Julia, and Peter
for putting up with it, and for their love.
