<A NAME=XPACK>One</A>
problem with earlier Lisp systems is the use of a single name space
for all symbols.  In large Lisp systems, with modules written by many
different programmers, accidental name collisions become a serious
problem.  Common Lisp addresses this problem through the <i>package system</i>,
derived from an earlier package system developed for
Lisp Machine Lisp [<A HREF="node368.html#BLUELISPM">55</A>].
In addition to preventing name-space conflicts, the
package system makes the modular structure of large Lisp systems more
explicit.
<P>
A <i>package</i> is a data structure that establishes a mapping from print
names (strings) to symbols.  The package thus replaces the ``oblist'' or
``obarray'' machinery of earlier Lisp systems.  At any given time one
package is current, and this package is used by the Lisp reader in
translating strings into symbols.  The current package is, by definition,
the one that is the
value of the global variable <tt>*package*</tt>.  It is possible to refer to
symbols in packages other than the current one through the use of
<i>package qualifiers</i> in the printed representation of the symbol.
For example, <tt>foo:bar</tt>, when seen by the reader,
refers to the symbol whose name is
<tt>bar</tt> in the package whose name is <tt>foo</tt>.
(Actually, this is true only if <tt>bar</tt> is an external symbol of <tt>foo</tt>,
that is, a symbol that is supposed to be visible outside of <tt>foo</tt>.
A reference to an internal symbol requires the intentionally
clumsier syntax <tt>foo::bar</tt>.)
<P>
The string-to-symbol mappings available in a given package are divided
into two classes, <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>.  We refer to the
symbols accessible via these mappings as being <i>external</i> and
<i>internal</i> symbols of the package in question, though really it is the
mappings that are different and not the symbols themselves.  Within a
given package, a name refers to one symbol or to none; if it does refer
to a symbol, then it is either external or internal in that
package, but not both.
<P>
External symbols are part of the package's public interface to other
packages.  External symbols are supposed to be chosen with some care and are
advertised to users of the package.  Internal symbols are for internal
use only, and these symbols are normally hidden from other packages.
Most symbols are created as internal symbols; they become external only
if they appear explicitly in an <tt>export</tt> command for the package.
<P>
A symbol may appear in many packages.  It will always have the same
name wherever it appears, but it may be external in some packages
and internal in others.  On the other hand,
the same name (string) may refer to different symbols in
different packages.
<P>
Normally, a symbol that appears in one or more packages
will be <i>owned</i> by one particular package, called the <i>home package</i>
of the symbol; that package is said to <i>own</i> the symbol.
Every symbol has a component called the <i>package cell</i>
that contains a pointer to its home package.
A symbol that is owned by some package is said to be <i>interned</i>.
Some symbols are not owned by any package; such a symbol
is said to be <i>uninterned</i>, and its package cell contains <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
Packages may be built up in layers.  From the point of view of a
package's user, the package is a single collection of mappings from
strings into internal and external symbols.  However, some of these
mappings may be established within the package itself, while other
mappings are inherited from other packages via the <tt>use-package</tt>
construct.  (The mechanisms responsible for this inheritance are
described below.)  In what follows, we will refer to a symbol as being
<i>accessible</i> in a package if it can be referred to
without a package qualifier when that package is current,
regardless of whether the mapping occurs within
that package or via inheritance.   We will refer to a symbol as being
<i>present</i> in a package if the mapping is in the package itself and is
not inherited from somewhere else.  Thus a symbol present in a package is accessible,
but an accessible symbol is not necessarily present.
<P>
A symbol is said to be <i>interned in a package</i> if it is
accessible in that package and also is owned (by either that package
or some other package).  Normally all the symbols accessible in
a package will in fact be owned by some package,
but the terminology is useful when
discussing the pathological case of an accessible but unowned (uninterned)
symbol.
<P>
As a verb, to <i>intern</i> a symbol in a package means to cause the
symbol to be interned in the package if it was not already;
this process is performed by the function <tt>intern</tt>.
If the symbol was previously unowned, then the package it is being
interned in becomes its owner (home package); but
if the symbol was previously owned by another package, that other package
continues to own the symbol.
<P>
To <i>unintern</i> a symbol from the package means to cause it to be not
present in the package
and, additionally, to cause the symbol to be uninterned if the
package was the home package (owner) of the symbol.
This process is performed by the function <tt>unintern</tt>.
