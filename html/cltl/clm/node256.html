The following functions and macros support precise control of what should
be done when a piece of output is too large to fit in the space available.
Three concepts underlie the way these operations work: <i>logical blocks</i>,
<i>conditional newlines</i>, and <i>sections</i>.  Before proceeding further, it is
important to define these terms.
<P>
The first line of figure <A HREF="node256.html#PRETTYPRINTSECTIONSFIGURE">27-1</A> shows a
schematic piece of output.  The characters in the output are represented by
hyphens.  The positions of conditional newlines are indicated by
digits.  The beginnings and ends of logical blocks are indicated in the
figure by ``<tt>&lt;</tt>'' and ``<tt>&gt;</tt>'' respectively.
<P>
The output as a whole is a logical block and the outermost section.  This
section is indicated by the <tt>0</tt>'s on the second line of
figure <A HREF="node256.html#PRETTYPRINTSECTIONSFIGURE">27-1</A>.  Logical blocks nested within
the output are specified by the macro
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.  Conditional newline positions are specified by calls
on <tt>pprint-newline</tt>.  Each conditional newline defines two sections (one
before it and one after it) and is associated with a third (the section
immediately containing it).
<P>
The section after a conditional newline consists of all the output up to,
but not including, (a) the next conditional newline immediately contained
in the same logical block; or if (a) is not applicable, (b) the next
newline that is at a lesser level of nesting in logical blocks; or if (b)
is not applicable, (c) the end of the output.
<P>
The section before a conditional newline consists of all the output back
to, but not including, (a) the previous conditional newline that is
immediately contained in the same logical block; or if (a) is not
applicable, (b) the beginning of the immediately containing logical block.
The last four lines in figure <A HREF="node256.html#PRETTYPRINTSECTIONSFIGURE">27-1</A> indicate
the sections before and after the four conditional newlines.
<P>
The section immediately containing a conditional newline is the shortest
section that contains the conditional newline in question.  In
figure <A HREF="node256.html#PRETTYPRINTSECTIONSFIGURE">27-1</A>, the first conditional newline is
immediately contained in the section marked with <tt>0</tt>'s, the second and third
conditional newlines are immediately contained in the section before the
fourth conditional newline, and the fourth conditional newline is
immediately contained in the section after the first conditional newline.

<P>
Whenever possible, the pretty printer displays the entire contents of a
section on a single line.  However, if the section is too long to fit in
the space available, line breaks are inserted at conditional newline
positions within the section.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>pprint-newline <i>kind</i> &amp;optional <i>stream</i></tt><P>The <i>stream</i> (which defaults to <tt>*standard-output*</tt>) follows the
standard conventions for stream arguments to printing functions (that is,
<tt>nil</tt> stands for <tt>*standard-output*</tt> and <tt>t</tt> stands for
<tt>*terminal-io*</tt>).  The <i>kind</i> argument specifies the style of
conditional newline.  It must be one of <tt>:linear</tt>, <tt>:fill</tt>,
<tt>:miser</tt>, or <tt>:mandatory</tt>.  An error is signaled if any other value is
supplied.  If <i>stream</i> is a pretty printing stream created by
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>, a line break is inserted in the output when the
appropriate condition below is satisfied.  Otherwise, <tt>pprint-newline</tt>
has no effect.  The value <tt>nil</tt> is always returned.
<P>
If <i>kind</i> is <tt>:linear</tt>, it specifies a `linear-style' conditional newline.
 A line break is inserted if and only if the immediately containing section
cannot be printed on one line.  The effect of this is that line breaks are
either inserted at every linear-style conditional newline in a logical
block or at none of them.
<P>
If <i>kind</i> is <tt>:miser</tt>, it specifies a `miser-style' conditional newline. 
A line break is inserted if and only if the immediately containing section
cannot be printed on one line and miser style is in effect in the
immediately containing logical block.  The effect of this is that
miser-style conditional newlines act like linear-style conditional
newlines, but only when miser style is in effect.  Miser style is in effect
for a logical block if and only if the starting position of the logical
block is less than or equal to <tt>*print-miser-width*</tt> from the right margin.
<P>
If <i>kind</i> is <tt>:fill</tt>, it specifies a `fill-style' conditional
newline.  A line break is inserted if and only if either (a) the following
section cannot be printed on the end of the current line, (b) the preceding
section was not printed on a single line, or (c) the immediately containing
section cannot be printed on one line and miser style is in effect in the
immediately containing logical block.  If a logical block is broken up into
a number of subsections by fill-style conditional newlines, the basic
effect is that the logical block is printed with as many subsections as
possible on each line.  However, if miser style is in effect, fill-style
conditional newlines act like linear-style conditional newlines.
<P>
If <i>kind</i> is <tt>:mandatory</tt>, it specifies a `mandatory-style' conditional
newline.  A line break is always inserted.  This implies that none of the
containing sections can be printed on a single line and will therefore
trigger the insertion of line breaks at linear-style conditional newlines
in these sections.
<P>
When a line break is inserted by any type of conditional newline, any
blanks that immediately precede the conditional newline are omitted from
the output and indentation is introduced at the beginning of the next line.
By default, the indentation causes the following line to begin in the same
horizontal position as the first character in the immediately containing
logical block.  (The indentation can be changed via <tt>pprint-indent</tt>.)
<P>
There are a variety of ways <i>un</i>conditional newlines can be introduced into
the output (for example, via <tt>terpri</tt> or by printing a string containing a newline
character).  As with mandatory conditional newlines, this prevents any of
the containing sections from being printed on one line.  In general, when
an unconditional newline is encountered, it is printed out without
suppression of the preceding blanks and without any indentation following
it.  However, if a per-line prefix has been specified (see
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>), that prefix will always be printed no matter how a
newline originates.
<P>
<BR><b>[Macro]</b><BR>
<pre>
pprint-logical-block (<i>stream-symbol</i> <i>list</i>
       <b>[[</b> { :prefix | :per-line-prefix} <i>p</i> | :suffix <i>s</i> <b>]]</b>)
       {<i>form</i>}*
</pre>
<P>This macro causes printing to be grouped into a logical block.  It returns
<tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
The <i>stream-symbol</i> must be a symbol.  If it is <tt>nil</tt>, it is treated the same
as if it were <tt>*standard-output*</tt>.  If it is <tt>t</tt>, it is treated the same as if
it were <tt>*terminal-io*</tt>.  The run-time value of <i>stream-symbol</i> must
be a stream (or <tt>nil</tt> standing for <tt>*standard-output*</tt>
or <tt>t</tt> standing for <tt>*terminal-io*</tt>).
The logical block is printed into this destination stream.
<P>
The body (which consists of the <i>form</i>s)
can contain any arbitrary Lisp forms.  Within the body,
<i>stream-symbol</i> (or <tt>*standard-output*</tt> if <i>stream-symbol</i> is
<tt>nil</tt>, or <tt>*terminal-io*</tt> if <i>stream-symbol</i> is <tt>t</tt>) is bound
to a ``pretty printing'' stream that supports decisions about the arrangement
of output and then forwards the output to the destination stream.  All the
standard printing functions (for example, <tt>write</tt>, <tt>princ</tt>, <tt>terpri</tt>) can
be used to send output to the pretty printing stream created by
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.  All and only the output sent to this pretty
printing stream is treated as being in the logical block.
<P>
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> and the pretty printing stream it creates have dynamic
extent.  It is undefined what happens if output is attempted outside of
this extent to the pretty printing stream created.  It is unspecified what
happens if, within this extent, any output is sent directly to the
underlying destination stream (by calling <tt>write-char</tt>, for example).
<P>
The <tt>:suffix</tt>, <tt>:prefix</tt>, and <tt>:per-line-prefix</tt> arguments must all
be expressions that (at run time) evaluate to strings.  The <tt>:suffix</tt> argument <i>s</i>
(which defaults to the null string) specifies a suffix that is printed just
after the logical block.  The <tt>:prefix</tt> and <tt>:per-line-prefix</tt> arguments
are mutually exclusive.  If neither <tt>:prefix</tt> nor <tt>:per-line-prefix</tt> is 
specified, a <tt>:prefix</tt> of the null string is assumed.
The <tt>:prefix</tt> argument
specifies a prefix <i>p</i> that is printed before the beginning of the logical block.
The <tt>:per-line-prefix</tt> specifies a prefix <i>p</i> that is printed before the block 
and at the beginning of each subsequent line in the block.
An error is signaled if <tt>:prefix</tt> and <tt>:per-line-prefix</tt> are both used
or if a <tt>:suffix</tt>, <tt>:prefix</tt>, or <tt>:pre-line-prefix</tt> argument does not
evaluate to a string.
<P>
The <i>list</i> is interpreted as being a list that the body is responsible
for printing.  (See <tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt> and
<tt>pprint-pop</tt>.)  If <i>list</i> does not (at run time) evaluate to a list,
it is printed using <tt>write</tt>.  (This makes it easier to write printing
functions that are robust in the face of malformed arguments.)  If
<tt>*print-circle*</tt> (and possibly also <tt>*print-shared*</tt>)
is not <tt>nil</tt> and <i>list</i> is a circular (or shared) reference
to a cons, then an appropriate ``<tt>#<i>n</i>#</tt>'' marker is printed.
(This makes it easy to write printing functions that provide full support
for circularity and sharing abbreviation.)  If <tt>*print-level*</tt> is not
<tt>nil</tt> and the logical block is at a dynamic nesting depth of greater
than <tt>*print-level*</tt> in logical blocks, ``<tt>#</tt>'' is printed.  (This
makes it easy to write printing functions that provide full support for depth
abbreviation.)
<P>
If any of the three preceding conditions occurs, the indicated output is
printed on <i>stream-symbol</i> and the <i>body</i> is skipped along with the
printing of the prefix and suffix.  (If the
body is not responsible for printing a list, then the first two tests
above can be turned off by supplying <tt>nil</tt> for the <i>list</i> argument.)
<P>
In addition to the <i>list</i> argument of <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>, the
arguments of the standard printing functions such as <tt>write</tt>,
<tt>print</tt>, <tt>pprint</tt>, <tt>print1</tt>, and <tt>pprint</tt>, as well as the
arguments of the standard <tt>format</tt> directives such as <tt>~A</tt>,
<tt>~S</tt>, (and <tt>~W</tt>) are all checked (when necessary) for
circularity and sharing.  However, such checking is not applied to the
arguments of the functions <tt>write-line</tt>, <tt>write-string</tt>, and
<tt>write-char</tt> or to the literal text output by <tt>format</tt>.  A
consequence of this is that you must use one of the latter functions if you
want to print some literal text in the output that is not supposed to be
checked for circularity or sharing.  (See the examples below.)
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> Detection of circularity and sharing is supported by the pretty printer by
in essence performing the requested output twice.  On the first pass,
circularities and sharing are detected and the actual outputting of
characters is suppressed.  On the second pass, the appropriate 
``<tt>#<i>n</i>=</tt>'' and ``<tt>#<i>n</i>#</tt>'' markers are inserted and
characters are output.
<P>
A consequence of this two-pass approach to the detection of circularity and
sharing is that the body of a <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> must not
perform any side-effects on the surrounding environment.  This includes not
modifying any variables that are bound outside of its scope.  Obeying this
restriction is facilitated by using <tt>pprint-pop</tt>, instead of an ordinary
<tt>pop</tt> when traversing a list being printed by the body of a
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.)
<hr>
<P>
<BR><b>[Macro]</b><BR>
<tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt><P><tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt> tests whether or not the <i>list</i>
argument of <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> has been exhausted (see
<tt>pprint-pop</tt>).  If this list has been reduced to <tt>nil</tt>,
<tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt> terminates the execution of the
immediately containing <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> except for the printing of
the suffix.  Otherwise <tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt> returns <tt>nil</tt>.
An error message is issued if <tt>pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted</tt> is used
anywhere other than syntactically nested within a call on
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.  It is undefined what happens if <tt>pprint-pop</tt>
is executed outside of the dynamic extent of this
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Macro]</b><BR>
<tt>pprint-pop</tt><P><tt>pprint-pop</tt> pops elements one at a time off the <i>list</i> argument of
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>, taking care to obey <tt>*print-length*</tt>,
<tt>*print-circle*</tt>, and <tt>*print-shared*</tt>.  An error message is issued if it is
used anywhere other than syntactically nested within a call on
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>. It is undefined what happens if <tt>pprint-pop</tt> is executed
outside of the dynamic extent of this call on <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.
<P>
Each time <tt>pprint-pop</tt> is called, it pops the next value off the <i>list</i> argument of <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> and returns it.  However,
before doing this, it performs three tests.  If the remaining list is not a
list (neither a cons nor <tt>nil</tt>), ``<tt>. </tt>'' is printed
followed by the remaining list.  (This makes it easier to write printing
functions that are robust in the face of malformed arguments.)  If
<tt>*print-length*</tt> is <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>pprint-pop</tt> has already been called
<tt>*print-length*</tt> times within the immediately containing logical block,
``<tt>...</tt>'' is printed.  (This makes it easy to write printing functions
that properly handle <tt>*print-length*</tt>.)  If <tt>*print-circle*</tt> (and possibly also
<tt>*print-shared*</tt>) is not <tt>nil</tt>, and the remaining list is a circular
(or shared) reference, then ``<tt>. </tt>'' is printed followed by an appropriate
``<tt>#<i>n</i>#</tt>'' marker.  (This catches instances of cdr circularity and sharing
in lists.)
<P>
If any of the three preceding conditions occurs, the indicated output is
printed on the pretty printing stream created by the immediately containing
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>
and the execution of the immediately containing
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>
is terminated except for the printing of the suffix.
<P>
If <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> is given a <i>list</i> argument of
<tt>nil</tt>-because it is not processing a list-<tt>pprint-pop</tt> can still
be used to obtain support for <tt>*print-length*</tt> (see the example function
<tt>pprint-vector</tt> below).  In this situation, the first and third tests
above are disabled and <tt>pprint-pop</tt> always returns <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>pprint-indent <i>relative-to</i> <i>n</i> &amp;optional <i>stream</i></tt><P><tt>pprint-indent</tt> specifies the indentation to use in a logical block.
<i>Stream</i> (which defaults to <tt>*standard-output*</tt>) follows the
standard conventions for stream arguments to printing functions.  The argument <i>n</i> specifies the indentation in ems.  If <i>relative-to</i> is <tt>:block</tt>, the
indentation is set to the horizontal position of the first character in the
block plus <i>n</i> ems.  If <i>relative-to</i> is <tt>:current</tt>, the
indentation is set to the current output position plus <i>n</i> ems.
<P>
The argument <i>n</i> can be negative; however, the total indentation cannot be moved
left of the beginning of the line or left of the end of the rightmost per-line
prefix.  Changes in indentation caused by <tt>pprint-indent</tt> do not take
effect until after the next line break.  In addition, in miser mode all
calls on <tt>pprint-indent</tt> are ignored, forcing the lines corresponding to the
logical block to line up under the first character in the block.
<P>
An error is signaled if a value other than <tt>:block</tt> or <tt>:current</tt> is
supplied for <i>relative-to</i>.  If <i>stream</i> is a pretty printing
stream created by <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>, <tt>pprint-indent</tt> sets the
indentation in the innermost dynamically enclosing logical block.
Otherwise, <tt>pprint-indent</tt> has no effect.  The value <tt>nil</tt> is always
returned.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>pprint-tab <i>kind</i> <i>colnum</i> <i>colinc</i> &amp;optional <i>stream</i></tt><P><tt>pprint-tab</tt> specifies tabbing as performed by the standard <tt>format</tt>
directive <tt>~T</tt>.  <i>Stream</i> (which defaults to
<tt>*standard-output*</tt>) follows the standard conventions for stream
arguments to printing functions.  The arguments <i>colnum</i> and <i>colinc</i> correspond to the two parameters to <tt>~T</tt> and are in
terms of ems.  The <i>kind</i> argument specifies the style of tabbing.  It
must be one of <tt>:line</tt> (tab as by <tt>~T</tt>) <tt>:section</tt> (tab as
by <tt>~T</tt>, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the
start of the dynamically enclosing section), <tt>:line-relative</tt> (tab as by

<tt>~@T</tt>, but measuring horizontal positions relative to
the start of the dynamically enclosing section).  An error is signaled if
any other value is supplied for <i>kind</i>.  If <i>stream</i> is a pretty
printing stream created by <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>, tabbing is performed.
Otherwise, <tt>pprint-tab</tt> has no effect.  The value <tt>nil</tt> is always
returned.

<i>Stream</i> follows the standard conventions for stream arguments to
printing functions.  Each function prints parentheses around the output if
and only if <i>colon?</i> (default <tt>t</tt>) is not <tt>nil</tt>.  Each function
ignores its <i>atsign?</i> argument and returns <tt>nil</tt>.  (These two
arguments are included in this way so that these functions can be used via
<tt>~/.../</tt> and as <tt>set-pprint-dispatch</tt> functions as well as
directly.)  Each function handles abbreviation and the detection of
circularity and sharing correctly and uses <tt>write</tt> to print <i>list</i>
when given a non-list argument.
<P>
The function <tt>pprint-linear</tt> prints a list either all on one line or with
each element on a separate line.  The function <tt>pprint-fill</tt> prints a list
with as many elements as possible on each line.  The function
<tt>pprint-tabular</tt> is the same as <tt>pprint-fill</tt> except that it prints the
elements so that they line up in columns.  This function takes an
additional argument <tt>tabsize</tt> (default 16) that specifies the column
spacing in ems.
<P>
As an example of the interaction of logical blocks, conditional newlines,
and indentation, consider the function <tt>pprint-defun</tt> below.  This
function pretty prints a list whose <i>car</i> is <tt>defun</tt> in the standard way assuming
that the length of the list is exactly 4.
<P><pre>
;;; Pretty printer function for DEFUN forms.

Suppose that one evaluates the following:
<P><pre>
(pprint-defun '(defun prod (x y) (* x y)))
</pre><P>
<P>
If the line width available is greater than or equal to 26, all of the
output appears on one line.  If the width is reduced to 25,
a line break is inserted at the linear-style conditional newline before
<tt>(* X Y)</tt>, producing the output shown below.  The
<tt>(pprint-indent :block 1)</tt> causes <tt>(* X Y)</tt> to be printed at a relative
indentation of 1 in the logical block.

<P>
If the width is 15, a line break is also inserted at the

up under the function name because of the call on

<P>
If <tt>*print-miser-width*</tt> were greater than or equal to 14,
the output would have been entirely in miser mode.
All indentation changes are
ignored in miser mode and line breaks are inserted at miser-style
conditional newlines.  The result would have been as follows:
<P><pre>

As an example of the use of a per-line prefix, consider that evaluating the expression
<P><pre>
(pprint-logical-block (nil nil :per-line-prefix &quot;;;; &quot;) 
  (pprint-defun '(defun prod (x y) (* x y))))
</pre><P>
produces the output
<P><pre>
;;; (DEFUN PROD 
;;;        (X Y) 
;;;   (* X Y))

with a line width of 20 and <tt>nil</tt> as the value
of the printer control variable <tt>*print-miser-width*</tt>.

</pre><P>
might appear instead.)
<P>
As a more complex (and realistic) example, consider the function
<tt>pprint-let</tt> below.  This specifies how to pretty print a <tt>let</tt> in the
standard style.  It is more complex than <tt>pprint-defun</tt> because it has
to deal with nested structure.  Also, unlike <tt>pprint-defun</tt>, it contains
complete code to print readably any possible list that begins with the
symbol <tt>let</tt>.  The outermost <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> handles the
printing of the input list as a whole and specifies that parentheses should
be printed in the output.  The second <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> handles the
list of binding pairs.  Each pair in the list is itself printed by the
innermost <tt>pprint-logical-block</tt>.  (A <tt>loop</tt> is used instead of
merely decomposing the pair into two elements so that readable output will
be produced no matter whether the list corresponding to the pair has one
element, two elements, or (being malformed) has more than two elements.)  A
space and a fill-style conditional newline are placed after each pair
except the last.  The loop at the end of the topmost
<tt>pprint-logical-block</tt> prints out the forms in the body of the <tt>let</tt>
separated by spaces and linear-style conditional newlines.
<P><pre>
;;; Pretty printer function for LET forms,

Suppose that the following is evaluated with <tt>*print-level*</tt> having the value <tt>4</tt> and
<tt>*print-circle*</tt> having the value <tt>t</tt>.
<P><pre>
(pprint-let '#1=(let (x (*print-length* (f (g 3)))

If the line length is greater than or equal to 77, the output produced
appears on one line.  However, if the line length is 76, line breaks are
inserted at the linear-style conditional newlines separating the forms in
the body and the output below is produced.  Note that the degenerate
binding pair <tt>X</tt> is printed readably even though it fails to be a list; a
depth abbreviation marker is printed in place of <tt>(G 3)</tt>; the binding pair
<tt>(Z . 2)</tt> is printed readably even though it is not a proper list; and
appropriate circularity markers are printed.
<P><pre>
#1=(LET (X (*PRINT-LENGTH* (F #)) (Z . 2) (K (CAR Y)))  
     (SETQ X (SQRT Z))

If the line length is reduced to 35, a line break is inserted at one of the
fill-style conditional newlines separating the binding pairs.
<P><pre>
#1=(LET (X (*PRINT-PRETTY* (F #))

Suppose that the line length is further reduced to 22 and <tt>*print-length*</tt> is
set to 3. In this situation, line breaks are inserted after both the first
and second binding pairs.  In addition, the second binding pair is itself
broken across two lines.  Clause (b) of the description of fill-style
conditional newlines prevents the binding pair <tt>(Z . 2)</tt> from being printed
at the end of the third line.  Note that the length abbreviation hides the
circularity from view and therefore the printing of circularity markers
disappears.
