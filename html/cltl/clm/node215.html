<P>
When a file is <i>opened</i>, a stream object is constructed to serve
as the file system's ambassador to the Lisp environment;
operations on the stream are reflected by operations on the file
in the file system.  The act of <i>closing</i> the file (actually,
the stream) ends the association; the transaction with the file
system is terminated, and input/output may no longer be performed
on the stream.  The stream function <tt>close</tt> may be used
to close a file; the functions described below may be used to open them.
The basic operation is <tt>open</tt>, but <tt>with-open-file</tt> is usually
more convenient for most applications.

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=27112>&#160;</A> 
to add to the function <tt>open</tt> a new keyword argument <tt>:external-format</tt>.
This argument did not appear in the preceding argument description in the
first edition.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
This returns a stream that is connected to the file specified by <i>filename</i>.
The <i>filename</i> is the name of the file to be opened; it may be a string,
a pathname, or a stream.  (If the <i>filename</i> is a stream, then it is not
closed first or otherwise affected; it is used merely to provide a file name
for the opening of a new stream.)

(STREAM-ACCESS) <A NAME=27120>&#160;</A>

<tt>open</tt>, if it is a stream, is always a stream of type <tt>file-stream</tt>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1988
(PATHNAME-STREAM) <A NAME=27125>&#160;</A> 
to specify exactly which streams may be used as pathnames.
See section <A HREF="node214.html#PATHNAMEFUNCTIONS">23.1.6</A>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in January 1989
(CLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS) <A NAME=27129>&#160;</A> 
to specify that <tt>open</tt> is unaffected by
whether the first argument, if a stream, is open or closed. If the first
argument is a stream, <tt>open</tt> behaves as if the function <tt>pathname</tt>
were applied to the stream and the resulting pathname used instead.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-WILD) <A NAME=27135>&#160;</A> 
to clarify that <tt>open</tt> accepts only non-wild pathnames;
an error is signaled if <tt>wild-pathname-p</tt> would be true of <i>filename</i>.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-LOGICAL) <A NAME=27141>&#160;</A>  to require <tt>open</tt>
to accept logical pathnames (see section <A HREF="node208.html#LOGICALPATHNAMESSECTION">23.1.5</A>).

<P>
The keyword arguments specify what kind of stream to produce and how
to handle errors:
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:direction</tt>
<DD>
This argument specifies whether the stream should handle input, output,
or both.
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:input</tt>
<DD>
The result will be an input stream.  This is the default.
<P>
<DT><tt>:output</tt>
<DD>
The result will be an output stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>:io</tt>
<DD>
The result will be a bidirectional stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>:probe</tt>
<DD>
The result will be a no-directional stream (in effect, the stream
is created and then closed).  This is useful for determining whether
a file exists without actually setting up a complete stream.
<P>
 </DL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<DT><tt>:element-type</tt>
<DD>
This argument specifies the type of the unit of transaction for the stream.
Anything that can be recognized as being a finite subtype of
<tt>character</tt> or <tt>integer</tt> is acceptable.  In particular,
the following types are recognized:
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>string-char</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a string-character.
The functions <tt>read-char</tt> and/or <tt>write-char</tt> may be
used on the stream.  This is the default.
<P>
<DT><tt>character</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is any character, not just a string-character.
The functions <tt>read-char</tt> and/or <tt>write-char</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
 </DL>

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=27171>&#160;</A> 
to eliminate the type <tt>string-char</tt>, add the type <tt>base-character</tt>,
and redefine <tt>open</tt> to use the type <tt>character</tt> as the default
<tt>:element-type</tt>.
<P>
The preceding two possibilities should therefore be
replaced by the following.
<P>
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>character</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is any character, not just a string-character.
The functions <tt>read-char</tt> and <tt>write-char</tt> (depending on the value of the
<tt>:direction</tt> argument) may be used on the stream.  This is the default.
<P>
<DT><tt>base-character</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a base character.
The functions <tt>read-char</tt> and <tt>write-char</tt> (depending on the value of the
<tt>:direction</tt> argument) may be used on the stream.
<P>
 </DL>
</blockquote>
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>(unsigned-byte <i>n</i>)</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is an unsigned byte (a non-negative integer) of size <i>n</i>.
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>unsigned-byte</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is an unsigned byte (a non-negative integer);
the size of the byte is determined by the file system.
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>(signed-byte <i>n</i>)</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a signed byte of size <i>n</i>.
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>signed-byte</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a signed byte;
the size of the byte is determined by the file system.
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>bit</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a bit (values <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt>).
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>(mod <i>n</i>)</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is a non-negative integer less than <i>n</i>.
The functions <tt>read-byte</tt> and/or <tt>write-byte</tt> may be
used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>:default</tt>
<DD>
The unit of transaction is to be determined by the file system, based
on the file it finds.
The type can be determined by using the function <tt>stream-element-type</tt>.
<P>
 </DL>
</blockquote>
<P>
<DT><tt>:if-exists</tt>
<DD>
This argument specifies the action to be taken if the <tt>:direction</tt> is
<tt>:output</tt> or <tt>:io</tt> and a file of the specified name already exists.
If the direction is <tt>:input</tt> or <tt>:probe</tt>, this argument is ignored.
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:error</tt>
<DD>
Signals an error.  This is the default when the version component of
the <i>filename</i> is not <tt>:newest</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:new-version</tt>
<DD>
Creates a new file with the same file name but with a larger version number.
This is the default when the version component of the <i>filename</i> is <tt>:newest</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:rename</tt>
<DD>
Renames the existing file to some other name and then creates a new file
with the specified name.
<P>
<DT><tt>:rename-and-delete</tt>
<DD>
Renames the existing file to some other name and then deletes it (but
does not expunge it, on those systems that distinguish deletion from
expunging).  Then create a new file with the specified name.
<P>
<DT><tt>:overwrite</tt>
<DD>
Uses the existing file.  Output operations on the stream
will destructively modify the file.
If the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:io</tt>,
the file is opened in a bidirectional mode that allows both
reading and writing.  The file pointer is initially positioned
at the beginning of the file; however, the file is not truncated
back to length zero when it is opened.
This mode is most useful when
the <tt>file-position</tt> function can be used on the stream.
<P>
<DT><tt>:append</tt>
<DD>
Uses the existing file.  Output operations on the stream
will destructively modify the file.  The file pointer is
initially positioned at the end of the file.
If the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:io</tt>,
the file is opened in a bidirectional mode that allows both
reading and writing.
<P>
<DT><tt>:supersede</tt>
<DD>
Supersedes the existing file.  If possible, the implementation should
arrange not to destroy the old file until the new stream is closed,
against the possibility that the stream will be closed in ``abort'' mode
(see <tt>close</tt>).
This differs from <tt>:new-version</tt> in that <tt>:supersede</tt> creates
a new file with the same name as the old one, rather than a file
name with a higher version number.
<P>
<DT><tt><tt>nil</tt></tt>
<DD>
Does not create a file or even a stream, but instead
simply returns <tt>nil</tt> to indicate failure.
<P>
 </DL>
</blockquote>
<P>
If the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:output</tt> or <tt>:io</tt>
and the value of <tt>:if-exists</tt> is <tt>:new-version</tt>,
then the version of the (newly created) file that is opened will
be a version greater than that of any other file in the file system
whose other pathname components are the same as those of <i>filename</i>.
<P>
If the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:input</tt> or <tt>:probe</tt>
or the value of <tt>:if-exists</tt> is not <tt>:new-version</tt>,
<i>and</i> the version component of the <i>filename</i> is <tt>:newest</tt>,
then the file opened is that file already existing in the file system
that has a version greater than that of any other file in the file system
whose other pathname components are the same as those of <i>filename</i>.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
Some file systems permit yet other actions to be taken when a file
already exists; therefore,
some implementations provide implementation-specific <tt>:if-exist</tt> options.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> The various file systems in existence today
have widely differing capabilities.  A given implementation may not
be able to support all of these options in exactly the manner stated.
An implementation is required to recognize all of these option keywords
and to try to do something ``reasonable'' in the context of the host operating
system.  Implementors are encouraged to approximate the semantics specified
here as closely as possible.
<P>
As an example, suppose that a file system does not support distinct file
versions and does not distinguish the notions of deletion and expunging
(in some file systems file deletion is reversible until an expunge operation
is performed).  Then <tt>:new-version</tt> might be treated the same as
<tt>:rename</tt> or <tt>:supersede</tt>, and <tt>:rename-and-delete</tt> might
be treated the same as <tt>:supersede</tt>.
<P>
If it is utterly impossible for an implementation to handle some option
in a manner close to what is specified here, it may simply signal an error.
The opening of files is an area where complete portability is too much to
hope for; the intent here is simply to make things as portable as possible
by providing specific names for a range of commonly supportable options.
<hr>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:if-does-not-exist</tt>
<DD>
This argument specifies the action to be taken if
a file of the specified name does not already exist.
<blockquote> <DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:error</tt>
<DD>
Signals an error.  This is the default if the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:input</tt>,
or if the <tt>:if-exists</tt> argument is <tt>:overwrite</tt> or <tt>:append</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:create</tt>
<DD>
Creates an empty file with the specified name and then proceeds as if it
had already existed (but do not perform any processing directed by the
<tt>:if-exists</tt> argument).
This is the default if the <tt>:direction</tt> is <tt>:output</tt>
or <tt>:io</tt>, and the <tt>:if-exists</tt> argument is anything but <tt>:overwrite</tt>
or <tt>:append</tt>.

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (MORE-CHARACTER-PROPOSAL) <A NAME=27303>&#160;</A> 
to add to the function <tt>open</tt> a new keyword argument <tt>:external-format</tt>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:external-format</tt>
<DD>
This argument specifies an implementation-recognized scheme for
representing characters in files.  The default value is <tt>:default</tt>
and is implementation-defined but must support the base characters.
An error is signaled if the implementation does recognize the specified format.
<P>
This argument may be specified if the <tt>:direction</tt> argument is
<tt>:input</tt>, <tt>:output</tt>, or <tt>:io</tt>.  It is an error to write a character
to the resulting stream that cannot be represented by the specified file format.
(However, the <tt>#\Newline</tt> character cannot produce such an error;
implementations must provide appropriate line division behavior for all character
streams.)
<P>
See <tt>stream-external-format</tt>.
</DL>
<img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">

<P>
When the caller is finished with the stream, it should close the file by
using the <tt>close</tt> function.  The <tt>with-open-file</tt>
form does this automatically, and so is preferred for most purposes.
<tt>open</tt> should be used only when the control structure of the program
necessitates opening and closing of a file in some way more complex than
provided by <tt>with-open-file</tt>.  It is suggested that any program that uses
<tt>open</tt> directly should use the special form <tt>unwind-protect</tt> to
close the file if an abnormal exit occurs.
<P>
<BR><b>[Macro]</b><BR>
<pre>
<tt>with-open-file (<i>stream</i> <i>filename</i> {<i>options</i>}*)</tt>
       <tt>{<i>declaration</i>}* {<i>form</i>}*</tt>
</pre>
<P><tt>with-open-file</tt>
evaluates the <i>forms</i> of the body (an implicit <tt>progn</tt>) with the variable
<i>stream</i> bound to a stream that reads or writes the file named by the
value of <i>filename</i>.
The <i>options</i> are evaluated and are used as keyword arguments to
the function <tt>open</tt>.
<P>
When control leaves the body, either normally or abnormally (such as by
use of <tt>throw</tt>), the file is automatically closed.  If a new
output file is being written, and control leaves abnormally, the file is
aborted and the file system is left, so far as possible, as if the file
had never been opened.  Because <tt>with-open-file</tt> always closes the
file, even when an error exit is taken, it is preferred over <tt>open</tt> for
most applications.
<P>
<i>filename</i> is the name of the file to be opened; it may be a string,
a pathname, or a stream.
