<P>
This function may be used to resize or reshape an array.
Its options are similar to those of <tt>make-array</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>adjust-array <i>array</i> <i>new-dimensions</i> &amp;key :element-type :initial-element :initial-contents :fill-pointer :displaced-to :displaced-index-offset</tt><P><tt>adjust-array</tt> takes an array and a number of other arguments
as for <tt>make-array</tt>.  The number of dimensions
specified by <i>new-dimensions</i> must equal the rank of <i>array</i>.
<P>
<tt>adjust-array</tt> returns an array of the same type and rank as <i>array</i>,
with the specified <i>new-dimensions</i>.  In effect, the <i>array</i> argument
itself is modified to conform to the new specifications, but this may
be achieved either by modifying the <i>array</i> or by creating a new
array and modifying the <i>array</i> argument to be <i>displaced</i> to the
new array.
<P>
In the simplest case, one specifies only the <i>new-dimensions</i>
and possibly an <tt>:initial-element</tt> argument.
Those elements of <i>array</i> that
are still in bounds appear in the new array.  The elements of
the new array that are not in the bounds of <i>array</i> are initialized
to the <tt>:initial-element</tt>; if this argument is not provided,
then the initial contents of any new elements are undefined.
<P>
If <tt>:element-type</tt> is specified, then <i>array</i> must be such that it could have
been originally created with that type; otherwise an error is signaled.
Specifying <tt>:element-type</tt> to <tt>adjust-array</tt> serves only to require such an
error check.
<P>
If <tt>:initial-contents</tt> or <tt>:displaced-to</tt>
is specified, then it is treated as for
<tt>make-array</tt>.  In this case none of the original contents of
<i>array</i> appears in the new array.
<P>
If <tt>:fill-pointer</tt> is specified, the fill pointer of the <i>array</i>
is reset as specified.  An error is signaled if <i>array</i> had no
fill pointer already.

X3J13 voted in June 1988
(ADJUST-ARRAY-FILL-POINTER) <A NAME=17991>&#160;</A> 
to clarify the treatment of the <tt>:fill-pointer</tt>
argument as follows.
<P>
If the <tt>:fill-pointer</tt> argument is not supplied, then the fill pointer
of the <i>array</i> is left alone.  It is an error
to try to adjust the <i>array</i> to a total size that is smaller
than its fill pointer.
<P>
If the <tt>:fill-pointer</tt> argument is supplied, then its value
must be either an integer, <tt>t</tt>, or <tt>nil</tt>.  If it is an integer,
then it is the new value for the fill pointer;
it must be non-negative and no greater than the new size to which the
<i>array</i> is being adjusted.
If it is <tt>t</tt>, then the fill pointer is set equal to the new size
for the <i>array</i>.  If it is <tt>nil</tt>, then the fill pointer is
left alone; it is as if the argument had not been supplied.
Again, it is an error
to try to adjust the <i>array</i> to a total size that is smaller
than its fill pointer.
<P>
An error is signaled if a non-<tt>nil :fill-pointer</tt> value
is supplied and the <i>array</i> to be adjusted does not already
have a fill pointer.
<P>
This extended treatment of the <tt>:fill-pointer</tt>
argument to <tt>adjust-array</tt> is consistent with the previously
existing treatment of the <tt>:fill-pointer</tt> argument to <tt>make-array</tt>.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<tt>adjust-array</tt> may, depending on the implementation and the arguments,
simply alter the given array or create and return a new one.
In the latter case the given array will be altered so as to be displaced
to the new array and have the given new dimensions.

It is not permitted to call <tt>adjust-array</tt> on an array that was not
created with the <tt>:adjustable</tt> option.  The predicate
<tt>adjustable-array-p</tt> may be used to determine whether or not
an array is adjustable.

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(ADJUST-ARRAY-NOT-ADJUSTABLE) <A NAME=18015>&#160;</A> 
to allow <tt>adjust-array</tt> to be applied to any array.
If <tt>adjust-array</tt> is applied to an array that was
originally created with <tt>:adjustable</tt> true,
the array returned is <tt>eq</tt> to its first argument.  It is not specified
whether <tt>adjust-array</tt> returns an array <tt>eq</tt> to its first argument for any
other arrays.  If the array returned by <tt>adjust-array</tt> is not <tt>eq</tt> to its
first argument, the original array is unchanged and does not share
storage with the new array.
<P>
Under this new definition, it is wise to treat <tt>adjust-array</tt>
in the same manner as <tt>delete</tt> and <tt>nconc</tt>: one should carefully
retain the returned value, for example by writing
<P><pre>
(setq my-array (adjust-array my-array ...))
</pre><P>
rather than relying solely on a side effect.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
If <tt>adjust-array</tt> is applied to an <i>array</i> that is displaced
to another array <i>x</i>, then afterwards neither <i>array</i> nor the returned
result is displaced to <i>x</i> unless such displacement is explicitly
re-specified in the call to <tt>adjust-array</tt>.
<P>
For example, suppose that the 4-by-4 array <tt>m</tt> looks like this:
<P><pre>
#2A( ( alpha     beta      gamma     delta ) 
     ( epsilon   zeta      eta       theta ) 
     ( iota      kappa     lambda    mu    ) 
     ( nu        xi        omicron   pi    ) )
</pre><P>
Then the result of
<P><pre>
(adjust-array m '(3 5) :initial-element 'baz)
</pre><P>
is a 3-by-5 array with contents
<P><pre>
#2A( ( alpha     beta      gamma     delta     baz ) 
     ( epsilon   zeta      eta       theta     baz ) 
     ( iota      kappa     lambda    mu        baz ) )
</pre><P>
Note that if array <tt>a</tt> is created displaced to array <tt>b</tt> and subsequently
array <tt>b</tt> is given to <tt>adjust-array</tt>, array <tt>a</tt> will still be
displaced to array <tt>b</tt>; the effects of this displacement and
the rule of row-major storage order must be taken into account.

X3J13 voted in June 1988 (ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT) <A NAME=18050>&#160;</A> 
to clarify the interaction of <tt>adjust-array</tt> with array displacement.
<P>
Suppose that an array <i>A</i> is to be adjusted.  There are four cases
according to whether or not <i>A</i> was displaced before adjustment
and whether or not the result is displaced after adjustment.
<UL><LI>
Suppose <i>A</i> is not displaced either before or after.
The dimensions of <i>A</i> are altered, and
the contents are rearranged as appropriate.  Additional elements of <i>A</i>
are taken from the <tt>:initial-element</tt> argument.
However, the use of the <tt>:initial-contents</tt> argument causes all old
contents to be discarded.
<P>
<LI>
Suppose <i>A</i> is not displaced before, but is displaced to array <i>C</i> after.
None of the original contents of <i>A</i> appears in <i>A</i> afterwards; <i>A</i>
now contains (some of) the contents of <i>C</i>, without any rearrangement of
<i>C</i>.
<P>
<LI>
Suppose <i>A</i> is displaced to array <i>B</i> before the call,
and is displaced to array <i>C</i> after the call.
(Note that <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> may be the same array.)
The contents of <i>B</i> do not appear in
<i>A</i> afterwards (unless such contents also happen to be in <i>C</i>,
as when <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> are the same, for example).  If
<tt>:displaced-index-offset</tt> is not specified in the call to
<tt>adjust-array</tt>, it defaults
to zero; the old offset (into <i>B</i>) is not retained.
<P>
<LI>
Suppose <i>A</i> is displaced to array <i>B</i> before the call,
but is not displaced afterwards.  In this case <i>A</i> gets
a new ``data region'' and (some of) the
contents of <i>B</i> are copied into it as appropriate to
maintain the existing old contents.  Additional elements of <i>A</i>
are taken from the <tt>:initial-element</tt> argument.
However, the use of the <tt>:initial-contents</tt> argument causes all old
contents to be discarded.
</UL>
<P>
If array <i>X</i> is displaced to array <i>Y</i>, and array <i>Y</i> is displaced
to array <i>Z</i>, and array <i>Y</i> is altered by <tt>adjust-array</tt>, array
<i>X</i> must now refer to the adjusted contents of <i>Y</i>.  This means that an
implementation may not collapse the chain to make <i>X</i> refer to <i>Z</i>
directly and forget that the chain of reference passes through array <i>Y</i>. 
(Caching techniques are of course permitted, as long as they preserve the
semantics specified here.)
<P>
If <i>X</i> is displaced to <i>Y</i>, it is an error to adjust <i>Y</i> in such a
way that it no longer has enough elements to satisfy <i>X</i>.  This error may be
signaled at the time of the adjustment, but this is not required.
<P>
Note that omitting the <tt>:displaced-to</tt> argument to <tt>adjust-array</tt> is
equivalent to specifying <tt>:displaced-to nil</tt>; in either case, the array is
not displaced after the call regardless of whether it was displaced before
the call.
