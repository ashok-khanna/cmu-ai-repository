<P>
The value of an ordinary variable
may be obtained simply by writing the name of the variable
as a form to be executed.  Whether this is treated as the name
of a special variable or a lexical variable is determined
by the presence or absence of an applicable <tt>special</tt> declaration;
see chapter <A HREF="node103.html#DECLAR">9</A>.
<P>
The following functions and special forms allow reference to the
values of constants and variables in other ways.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>quote</tt> <tt><i>object</i></tt><P><tt>(quote <i>x</i>)</tt> simply returns <i>x</i>.
The <i>object</i> is not evaluated and may be any Lisp object whatsoever.
This construct allows any Lisp object to be written as a constant
value in a program.
For example:
<P><pre>
(setq a 43) 
(list a (cons a 3)) => (43 (43 . 3)) 
(list (quote a) (quote (cons a 3)) => (a (cons a 3))
</pre><P>
Since <tt>quote</tt> forms are so frequently useful
but somewhat cumbersome to type, a standard abbreviation is defined for them:
any form <i>f</i> preceded by a single quote <tt>(')</tt> character
is assumed to have <tt>(quote  )</tt> wrapped around it to
make <tt>(quote <i>f</i>)</tt>.
For example:
<P><pre>
(setq x '(the magic quote hack))
</pre><P>
is normally interpreted by <tt>read</tt> to mean
<P><pre>
(setq x (quote (the magic quote hack)))
</pre><P>
See section <A HREF="node190.html#MACROCHARACTERSSECTION">22.1.3</A>.

X3J13 voted in January 1989 (CONSTANT-MODIFICATION) <A NAME=4833>&#160;</A>  to clarify that
it is an error to destructively modify any object that appears as a constant
in executable code, whether within a <tt>quote</tt> special form or as
a self-evaluating form.
<P>
See section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A> for a discussion of how quoted constants
are treated by the compiler.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (QUOTE-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=4838>&#160;</A>  to clarify that
<tt>eval</tt> and <tt>compile</tt> are not permitted either to copy or
to coalesce (``collapse'') constants (see <tt>eq</tt>)
appearing in the code they process; the resulting
program behavior must refer to objects that are <tt>eql</tt> to the
corresponding objects in the source code.
Moreover, the constraints introduced by the votes on
issues (CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES) <A NAME=4843>&#160;</A> 
and (CONSTANT-CIRCULAR-COMPILATION) <A NAME=4844>&#160;</A> 
on what kinds of objects may appear
as constants apply only to <tt>compile-file</tt> (see section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>function</tt> <tt><i>fn</i></tt><P>The value of <tt>function</tt> is always the functional interpretation
of <i>fn</i>; <i>fn</i> is interpreted as if it had appeared
in the functional position of a function invocation.
In particular,
if <i>fn</i> is a symbol, the functional definition associated with
that symbol is returned; see <tt>symbol-function</tt>.
If <i>fn</i> is a lambda-expression, then a
``lexical closure'' is returned, that is, a function that when invoked
will execute the body of the lambda-expression in such a way as to
observe the rules of lexical scoping properly.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in June 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE) <A NAME=4857>&#160;</A> 
to specify that the result of a <tt>function</tt> special form is always
of type <tt>function</tt>.  This implies that a form <tt>(function <i>fn</i>)</tt>
may be interpreted as <tt>(the (function <i>fn</i>))</tt>.
<P>
It is an error to use the <tt>function</tt> special form on a
    symbol that does not denote a function in the lexical or global environment in
    which the special form appears.  Specifically, it is an error to use the
    <tt>function</tt> special form on a symbol that denotes a macro or special form.
    Some implementations may choose not to signal this error for
        performance reasons, but implementations are forbidden
        to extend the semantics of <tt>function</tt> in this respect; that is, an
        implementation is not allowed to
        define the failure to signal an error to be a ``useful'' behavior.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (FUNCTION-NAME) <A NAME=4867>&#160;</A>  to extend <tt>function</tt>
to accept any function-name (a symbol or a list
whose <i>car</i> is <tt>setf</tt>-see section <A HREF="node77.html#FUNCTIONNAMESECTION">7.1</A>)
as well as lambda-expressions.
Thus one may write <tt>(function (setf cadr))</tt> to refer to the <tt>setf</tt>
expansion function for <tt>cadr</tt>.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<A NAME=4876>&#160;</A>
For example:
<P><pre>
(defun adder (x) (function (lambda (y) (+ x y))))
</pre><P>
The result of <tt>(adder 3)</tt> is a function that will add <tt>3</tt> to its
argument:
<P><pre>
(setq add3 (adder 3)) 
(funcall add3 5) => 8
</pre><P>
This works because <tt>function</tt> creates a closure of
the inner lambda-expression that is able to refer to the value <tt>3</tt>
of the variable <tt>x</tt> even after control has returned from the
function <tt>adder</tt>.
<P>
More generally, a lexical closure in effect retains the ability to
refer to lexically visible <i>bindings</i>, not just values.
Consider this code:
<P><pre>
(defun two-funs (x) 
  (list (function (lambda () x)) 
        (function (lambda (y) (setq x y))))) 
(setq funs (two-funs 6)) 
(funcall (car funs)) => 6 
(funcall (cadr funs) 43) => 43 
(funcall (car funs)) => 43
</pre><P>
The function <tt>two-funs</tt> returns a list of two functions, each of which
refers to the <i>binding</i> of the variable <tt>x</tt> created on entry to
the function <tt>two-funs</tt> when it was called with argument <tt>6</tt>.
This binding has the value <tt>6</tt> initially, but <tt>setq</tt> can alter
a binding.  The lexical closure created for the first lambda-expression
does not ``snapshot'' the value <tt>6</tt> for <tt>x</tt> when the closure is created.
The second function can be used to alter the binding (to <tt>43</tt>, in the
example), and this altered
value then becomes accessible to the first function.
<P>
In situations where a closure of a lambda-expression over the same set
of bindings may be produced more than once, the various resulting closures
may or may not be <tt>eq</tt>, at the discretion of the implementation.
For example:
<P><pre>
(let ((x 5) (funs '())) 
  (dotimes (j 10) 
    (push #'(lambda (z) 
              (if (null z) (setq x 0) (+ x z))) 
          funs)) 
  funs)
</pre><P>
The result of the above expression is a list of ten closures.
Each logically requires only the binding of <tt>x</tt>.
It is the same binding in each case,
so the ten closures may or may not be the same identical (<tt>eq</tt>) object.
On the other hand, the result of the expression
<P><pre>
(let ((funs '())) 
  (dotimes (j 10) 
    (let ((x 5)) 
      (push (function (lambda (z) 
                        (if (null z) (setq x 0) (+ x z)))) 
            funs))) 
  funs)
</pre><P>
is also a list of ten closures.
However, in this case no two of the closures may be <tt>eq</tt>, because each
closure is over a distinct binding of <tt>x</tt>, and these bindings can
be behaviorally distinguished because of the use of <tt>setq</tt>.
<P>
The question of distinguishable behavior is important; the result of
the simpler expression
<P><pre>
(let ((funs '())) 
  (dotimes (j 10) 
    (let ((x 5)) 
      (push (function (lambda (z) (+ x z))) 
            funs))) 
  funs)
</pre><P>
is a list of ten closures that <i>may</i> be pairwise <tt>eq</tt>.  Although
one might think that a different binding of <tt>x</tt> is involved for
each closure (which is indeed the case), the bindings cannot be distinguished
because their values are identical and immutable, there being no occurrence
of <tt>setq</tt> on <tt>x</tt>.  A compiler would therefore be justified in
transforming the expression to
<P><pre>
(let ((funs '())) 
  (dotimes (j 10) 
    (push (function (lambda (z) (+ 5 z))) 
          funs)) 
  funs)
</pre><P>
where clearly the closures may be the same after all.
The general rule, then, is that the implementation is free to
have two distinct evaluations of the same <tt>function</tt> form
produce identical (<tt>eq</tt>) closures if it can prove that the
two conceptually distinct resulting closures must in fact be
behaviorally identical with respect to invocation.
This is merely a permitted optimization; a perfectly valid
implementation might simply cause every distinct evaluation of a <tt>function</tt>
form to produce a new closure object not <tt>eq</tt> to any other.
<P>
Frequently a compiler can deduce that a closure in fact does not
need to close over any variable bindings.  For example,
in the code fragment
<P><pre>
(mapcar (function (lambda (x) (+ x 2))) y)
</pre><P>
the function <tt>(lambda (x) (+ x 2))</tt> contains no references to any outside
entity.  In this important special case, the same ``closure'' may be used
as the value for all evaluations of the <tt>function</tt> special form.
Indeed, this value need not be a closure object at all; it may
be a simple compiled function containing no environment information.
This example is simply a special case of the foregoing discussion and
is included as a hint to implementors familiar with previous methods
of implementing Lisp.  The distinction between closures and other
kinds of functions is somewhat pointless, actually, as Common Lisp defines
no particular representation for closures and no way to distinguish
between closures and non-closure functions.  All that matters is that
the rules of lexical scoping be obeyed.
<P>
Since <tt>function</tt> forms are so frequently useful
but somewhat cumbersome to type, a standard abbreviation is defined for them:
any form <i>f</i> preceded by <tt>#'</tt> (<tt>#</tt> followed by an apostrophe)
is assumed to have <tt>(function  )</tt> wrapped around it to make
<tt>(function <i>f</i>)</tt>.  For example,
<P><pre>
(remove-if #'numberp '(1 a b 3))
</pre><P>
is normally interpreted by <tt>read</tt> to mean
<P><pre>
(remove-if (function numberp) '(1 a b 3))

<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>symbol-value</tt> <tt><i>symbol</I></tt><P><tt>symbol-value</tt> returns the current value of the dynamic (special) variable
named by <i>symbol</i>.
An error occurs if the symbol has no value; see <tt>boundp</tt>
and <tt>makunbound</tt>.
Note that constant symbols are really variables that cannot be changed,
and so <tt>symbol-value</tt> may be used to get the value of
a named constant.  In particular, <tt>symbol-value</tt> of a keyword
will return that keyword.
<P>
<tt>symbol-value</tt> cannot access the value of a lexical variable.
<P>
This function is particularly useful for implementing interpreters
for languages embedded in Lisp.
The corresponding assignment primitive is <tt>set</tt>;
alternatively, <tt>symbol-value</tt> may be used with <tt>setf</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>symbol-function</tt> <tt><i>symbol</I></tt><P><tt>symbol-function</tt> returns the current global function definition
named by <i>symbol</i>.  An error is signalled if the symbol has no function
definition; see <tt>fboundp</tt>.  Note that the definition may be a
function or may be an object representing a special form or macro.
In the latter case, however, it is an error
to attempt to invoke the object as a function.
If it is desired to process macros, special forms, and functions
equally well, as when writing an interpreter,
it is best first to test the symbol with <tt>macro-function</tt>
and <tt>special-form-p</tt>
and then to invoke the functional value only if these
two tests both yield false.
<P>
This function is particularly useful for implementing interpreters
for languages embedded in Lisp.
<P>
<tt>symbol-function</tt> cannot access the value of a lexical function name
produced by <tt>flet</tt> or <tt>labels</tt>; it can access only
the global function value.
<P>
The global function definition of a symbol may be altered
by using <tt>setf</tt> with <tt>symbol-function</tt>.
Performing this operation causes the symbol to have <i>only</i> the
specified definition as its global function definition; any previous
definition, whether as a macro or as a function, is lost.
It is an error to attempt to redefine the name of a special
form (see table <A HREF="node59.html#SPECIALFORMTABLE">5-1</A>).

X3J13 voted in June 1988 (FUNCTION-TYPE) <A NAME=4966>&#160;</A>  to clarify the behavior
of <tt>symbol-function</tt> in the light of the redefinition of the type <tt>function</tt>.
<UL><LI> It is permissible to call <tt>symbol-function</tt>
    on any symbol for which <tt>fboundp</tt> returns true.

<P>
<LI> If <tt>fboundp</tt> returns true for a symbol
        but the symbol denotes a macro or special form,
        then the value returned by <tt>symbol-function</tt> is not well-defined

<P>
<LI> When <tt>symbol-function</tt> is used with <tt>setf</tt>
 the new value must be of type <tt>function</tt>.
	It is an error to set the <tt>symbol-function</tt> of a symbol to a

It is possible for <i>both</i> <tt>special-form-p</tt> and <tt>macro-function</tt>
