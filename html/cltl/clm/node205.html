<A NAME=PATHNAMECOMPONENTCASESECTION>Issues</A>
of alphabetic case in pathnames are a major source of problems.
  In some file systems, the customary case is lowercase, in some uppercase,
  in some mixed.  Some file systems are case-sensitive (that is, they treat
  <tt>FOO</tt> and <tt>foo</tt> as different file names) and others are not.
<P>
  There are two kinds of pathname case portability problems: moving
  programs from one Common Lisp to another, and moving pathname component
  values from one file system to another.  The solution to the first problem
  is the requirement that all
  Common Lisp implementations that support a particular file system must
  use compatible representations for pathname component values.  The solution to
  the second problem is the use of a common representation for the
  least-common-denominator pathname component values that exist on all
  interesting file systems.
<P>
  Requiring a common representation directly conflicts with the
  desire among programmers that use only one file system to work with the
  local conventions and to ignore issues of porting to other file
  systems.  The common representation cannot be the same as local (varying)
  conventions.
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-COMPONENT-CASE) <A NAME=26133>&#160;</A>  to
add a keyword argument <tt>:case</tt> to each of the functions
  <tt>make-pathname</tt>, <tt>pathname-host</tt>,
  <tt>pathname-device</tt>, <tt>pathname-directory</tt>, <tt>pathname-name</tt>,
  and <tt>pathname-type</tt>.
  The possible values for the argument are <tt>:common</tt> and <tt>:local</tt>.
  The default is <tt>:local</tt>.
<P>
  The value <tt>:local</tt> means that strings given to <tt>make-pathname</tt>
  or returned by any of the pathname component accessors
  follow the local file system's conventions for alphabetic case.
  Strings given to <tt>make-pathname</tt> will be used exactly as written if
  the file system supports both cases.  If the file system
  supports only one case, the strings will be translated to that case.
<P>
  The value <tt>:common</tt> means that strings given to <tt>make-pathname</tt>
  or returned by any of the pathname component accessors
  follow this common convention:
<UL><LI> All uppercase means that a file system's customary case will be used.
<LI> All lowercase means that the opposite of the customary case will be used.
<LI> Mixed case represents itself.
</UL>
  Uppercase is used as the common case for no better reason than
  consistency with Lisp symbols.
  The second and third points allow translation from local representation to
  common and back to be information-preserving.  (Note that translation
  from common to local representation and back may or may not be information-preserving,
  depending on the nature of the local representation.)
<P>
  Namestrings always use <tt>:local</tt> file system case conventions.
<P>
  Finally, <tt>merge-pathnames</tt> and <tt>translate-pathname</tt> map customary case in the
  input pathnames into customary case in the output pathname.
<P>
  Examples of possible use of this convention:
<UL>  <LI> TOPS-20 is case-sensitive and prefers uppercase,
  translating lowercase to uppercase unless escaped with <tt>^V</tt>;
  for a TOPS-20-based
  file system, a Common Lisp implementation
  should use identical
  representations for common and local.
<P>
<LI> UNIX is case-sensitive and prefers lowercase; for a UNIX-based file system,
  a Common Lisp implementation should translate between
  common and local representations by inverting the case of non-mixed-case strings.
<P>
<LI> VAX/VMS is uppercase-only (that is, the file system translates all file
  name arguments to uppercase); for a VAX/VMS-based file system,
  a Common Lisp implementation should
  translate common representation to local by
  converting to uppercase and should translate local representation
  to common with no change.
<P>
<LI> The Macintosh operating system is case-insensitive and prefers lowercase,
  but remembers the cases of letters actually used to name a file;
  for a Macintosh-based file system, a Common Lisp implementation should translate
  between common and local representations by inverting the case of non-mixed-case strings
  and should ignore case when determining whether two pathnames are <tt>equal</tt>.
</UL>
<P>
Here are some examples of this behavior.  Assume that the host <tt>T</tt> runs
TOPS-20, <tt>U</tt> runs UNIX, <tt>V</tt> runs VAX/VMS, and <tt>M</tt> runs the Macintosh
operating system.

(defun pathname-example (name)

            (pathname-name path :case :local))))

(pathname-example &quot;V:[me]TeX.LISP&quot;)        => &quot;TEX&quot; and &quot;TEX&quot; 
(pathname-example &quot;M:FOO.LISP&quot;)            => &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;FOO&quot; 
(pathname-example &quot;M:foo.LISP&quot;)            => &quot;FOO&quot; and &quot;foo&quot; 
(pathname-example &quot;M:TeX.LISP&quot;)            => &quot;TeX&quot; and &quot;TeX&quot;
</pre><P>
The following example illustrates the creation of new pathnames.
The name is converted from common representation to local because
namestrings always use local conventions.
<P><pre>
(defun make-pathname-example (h n) 
  (namestring (make-pathname :host h :name n :case :common)) 

(make-pathname-example &quot;T&quot; &quot;FOO&quot;) => &quot;T:FOO&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;T&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) => &quot;T:^Vf^Vo^Vo&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;T&quot; &quot;TeX&quot;) => &quot;T:T^VeX&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;U&quot; &quot;FOO&quot;) => &quot;U:foo&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;U&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) => &quot;U:FOO&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;U&quot; &quot;TeX&quot;) => &quot;U:TeX&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;V&quot; &quot;FOO&quot;) => &quot;V:FOO&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;V&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) => &quot;V:FOO&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;V&quot; &quot;TeX&quot;) => &quot;V:TeX&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;M&quot; &quot;FOO&quot;) => &quot;M:foo&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;M&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) => &quot;M:FOO&quot; 
(make-pathname-example &quot;M&quot; &quot;TeX&quot;) => &quot;M:TeX&quot;
</pre><P>
A big advantage of this set of conventions is that one can, for example,
call <tt>make-pathname</tt> with <tt>:type &quot;LISP&quot;</tt> and <tt>:case :common</tt>,
and the result will appear in a namestring as <tt>.LISP</tt> or <tt>.lisp</tt>,
whichever is appropriate.
