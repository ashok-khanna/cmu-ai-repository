X3J13 voted in June 1989 (SYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS) <A NAME=8713>&#160;</A>  to add some facilities for obtaining information
from environment objects of the kind received as arguments
by macro expansion functions, <tt>*macroexpand-hook*</tt> functions,
and <tt>*evalhook*</tt> functions.
There is a minimal set of accessors <tt>(variable-information</tt>,
<tt>function-information</tt>, and <tt>declaration-information)</tt> and a constructor
<tt>(augment-environment)</tt> for environments.
<P>
All of the standard declaration specifiers, with the exception of <tt>special</tt>,
can be defined fairly easily using <tt>define-declaration</tt>.  It also
seems to be able to handle most extended declarations.
<P>
The function <tt>parse-macro</tt> is provided so that
users don't have to write their
  own code to destructure macro arguments.
This function is not entirely necessary since X3J13 voted
in March 1989 (DESTRUCTURING-BIND) <A NAME=8723>&#160;</A> 
to add <tt>destructuring-bind</tt> to the language.
  However, <tt>parse-macro</tt> is worth having anyway, since any program-analyzing
  program is going to need to define it, and the implementation isn't completely
  trivial even with <tt>destructuring-bind</tt> to build upon.
<P>
  The function <tt>enclose</tt> allows expander functions to be defined in a non-null
  lexical environment, as required by the vote of X3J13 in
  March 1989 (DEFINING-MACROS-NON-TOP-LEVEL) <A NAME=8728>&#160;</A> .  It
  also provides a mechanism by which a program processing
  the body of an <tt>(eval-when (:compile-toplevel) ...)</tt> form
  can execute it in the enclosing environment (see issue
  (EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL) <A NAME=8730>&#160;</A> ).
<P>
In all of these functions the argument named <i>env</i> is an environment
object.  (It is not required that implementations
 provide a distinguished representation for such objects.)  Optional <i>env</i>
 arguments default to <tt>nil</tt>, which represents the local null lexical environment
 (containing only global definitions and proclamations that are present in the
 run-time environment).  All of these functions should signal an error of type
 <tt>type-error</tt> if the value of an environment argument is not a syntactic
 environment object.
<P>
 The accessor functions <tt>variable-information</tt>, <tt>function-information</tt>, and
 <tt>declaration-information</tt> retrieve information about
 declarations that are in
 effect in the environment.  Since implementations are permitted to ignore
 declarations (except for <tt>special</tt> declarations and <tt>optimize safety</tt>
 declarations if they ever compile unsafe code), these accessors are required
 only to return information about declarations that were explicitly added to
 the environment using <tt>augment-environment</tt>.  They might also return
 information about declarations recognized and added to the environment by the
 interpreter or the compiler, but that is at the discretion of the
 implementor.  Implementations are also permitted to canonicalize
 declarations, so the information returned by the accessors might not be
 identical to the information that was passed to <tt>augment-environment</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>variable-information</tt> <tt><i>variable</i></tt> <tt>&amp;optional</tt> <tt><i>env</i></tt><P>  This function returns information about the interpretation of the symbol
  <i>variable</i> when it appears as a variable within the lexical environment <i>env</i>.
  Three values are returned.
<P>
  The first value indicates the type of definition or binding for <i>variable</i>
  in <i>env</i>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>nil</tt>
<DD>
There is no apparent definition or binding for <i>variable</i>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:special</tt>
<DD>
The <i>variable</i> refers to a special variable, either declared or proclaimed.
<P>
<DT><tt>:lexical</tt>
<DD>
The <i>variable</i> refers to a lexical variable.
<P>
<DT><tt>:symbol-macro</tt>
<DD>
The <i>variable</i> refers to a <tt>symbol-macrolet</tt> binding.
<P>
<DT><tt>:constant</tt>
<DD>
Either the <i>variable</i> refers to a named constant defined by
<tt>defconstant</tt> or the <i>variable</i> is a keyword symbol.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
  The second value indicates whether there is a local binding of the name.  If
  the name is locally bound, the second value is true; otherwise, the second value
  is <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
  The third value is an a-list containing information about declarations
  that apply to the apparent binding of the <i>variable</i>.  The keys in the a-list
  are symbols that name declaration specifiers, and the format of the
  corresponding value in the <i>cdr</i> of each pair depends on the particular 
  declaration name involved.  The standard declaration names
  that might appear as keys in this a-list are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>dynamic-extent</tt>
<DD>
A non-<tt>nil</tt> value indicates that the <i>variable</i> has been
                declared <tt>dynamic-extent</tt>. If the value is <tt>nil</tt>, the pair
                might be omitted.
<P>
<DT><tt>ignore</tt>
<DD>
A non-<tt>nil</tt> value indicates that the <i>variable</i> has been declared
                <tt>ignore</tt>. If the value is <tt>nil</tt>, the pair might be omitted.
<P>
<DT><tt>type</tt>
<DD>
The value is a type specifier associated with the <i>variable</i> by a <tt>type</tt>
                declaration or an abbreviated declaration such as
                <tt>(fixnum <i>variable</i>)</tt>.
                If no explicit association exists, either by <tt>proclaim</tt> or
                <tt>declare</tt>, then the type specifier is <tt>t</tt>.  It is permissible for
                implementations to use a type specifier that is equivalent
                to or a supertype of the one appearing in the original
                declaration.  If the value is <tt>t</tt>, the pair might be
                omitted.
<P>
 </DL>
  If an implementation supports additional declaration specifiers that
  apply to variable bindings, those declaration names might also
  appear in the a-list.  However, the corresponding key must not
  be a symbol that is external in any package defined in the standard
  or that is otherwise accessible in the <tt>common-lisp-user</tt> package.
<P>
  The a-list might contain multiple entries for a given key.
  The consequences of destructively modifying the list
  structure of this a-list or its elements (except for values that 
  appear in the a-list as a result of <tt>define-declaration</tt>) are undefined.
<P>
  Note that the global binding might differ from the
  local one and can be retrieved by calling <tt>variable-information</tt>
  with a null lexical environment.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>function-information</tt> <tt><i>function</i></tt> <tt>&amp;optional</tt> <tt><i>env</i></tt><P>  This function returns information about the interpretation of the function-name
  <i>function</i> when it appears in a functional position within lexical 
  environment <i>env</i>.  Three values are returned.
<P>
  The first value indicates the type of definition or binding of the function-name
  which is apparent in <i>env</i>:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>nil</tt>
<DD> There is no apparent definition for <i>function</i>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:function</tt>
<DD> The <i>function</i> refers to a function.
<P>
<DT><tt>:macro</tt>
<DD> The <i>function</i> refers to a macro.
<P>
<DT><tt>:special-form</tt>
<DD> The <i>function</i> refers to a special form.
<P>
 </DL>
  Some function-names can refer to both a global macro and a global special
  form.  In such a case the macro takes precedence and <tt>:macro</tt> is returned as
  the first value.
<P>
  The second value specifies whether the definition is local or global.  If
  local, the second value is true; it is <tt>nil</tt> when the definition is
  global.
<P>
  The third value is an a-list containing information about declarations
  that apply to the apparent binding of the function.  The keys in the a-list
  are symbols that name declaration specifiers, and the format of the
  corresponding values in the <i>cdr</i> of each pair depends on the particular 
  declaration name involved.  The standard declaration names
  that might appear as keys in this a-list are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>dynamic-extent</tt>
<DD>
A non-<tt>nil</tt> value indicates that the function has been
                declared <tt>dynamic-extent</tt>.  If the value is <tt>nil</tt>, the pair
                might be omitted.
<P>
<DT><tt>inline</tt>
<DD>
The value is one of the symbols <tt>inline</tt>, <tt>notinline</tt>, or <tt>nil</tt> to indicate
                whether the function-name has been declared <tt>inline</tt>,
                declared <tt>notinline</tt>, or neither, respectively.
                If the value is <tt>nil</tt>, the pair might be omitted.
<P>
<DT><tt>ftype</tt>
<DD>
The value is the type specifier associated with the function-name in the
                environment, or the symbol <tt>function</tt> if there is no functional
                type declaration or proclamation associated with the function-name.
                This value might not include all the apparent <tt>ftype</tt>
                declarations for the function-name.  It is permissible for
                implementations to use a type specifier that is equivalent
                to or a supertype of the one that appeared in the original
                declaration.  If the value is <tt>function</tt>, the pair might be
                omitted.
<P>
 </DL>
  If an implementation supports additional declaration specifiers that
  apply to function bindings, those declaration names might also
  appear in the a-list.  However, the corresponding key must not be
  a symbol that is external in any package defined in the standard or
  that is otherwise accessible in the <tt>common-lisp-user</tt> package.
<P>
  The a-list might contain multiple entries for a given key.
  In this case the value associated with the first entry has
  precedence.  The consequences of destructively modifying the list
  structure of this a-list or its elements (except for values
  that appear in the a-list as a result of <tt>define-declaration</tt>) are 
  undefined.
<P>
  Note that the global binding might differ from the local
  one and can be retrieved by calling <tt>function-information</tt> with a null
  lexical environment.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>declaration-information</tt> <tt><i>decl-name</i></tt> <tt>&amp;optional</tt> <tt><i>env</i></tt><P>  This function returns information about declarations named by the
  symbol <i>decl-name</i> that are in force in the environment <i>env</i>.
  Only declarations that do not apply to function or variable bindings
  can be accessed with this function.  The format of the information
  that is returned depends on the <i>decl-name</i> involved.
<P>
  It is required that this function recognize <tt>optimize</tt> and <tt>declaration</tt> as
  <i>decl-name</i>s.  The values returned for these two cases are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>optimize</tt>
<DD>
A single value is returned,
a list whose entries are of the form <tt>(<i>quality</i> <i>value</i>)</tt>, where
                <i>quality</i> is one of the standard optimization qualities
                <tt>(speed</tt>, <tt>safety</tt>, <tt>compilation-speed</tt>, <tt>space</tt>, <tt>debug)</tt>
                or some implementation-specific optimization quality, and
                <i>value</i> is an integer in the range 0 to 3 (inclusive).
                The returned list
                always contains an entry for each of the standard qualities and
                for each of the implementation-specific qualities.  In the
                absence of any previous declarations, the associated values are
                implementation-dependent.  The list might contain multiple
                entries for a quality, in which case the first such entry
                specifies the current value.
                The consequences of destructively modifying this list or
		its elements are undefined.
<P>
<DT><tt>declaration</tt>
<DD>
A single value is returned,
a list of the declaration names that have been proclaimed as
                valid through the use of the <tt>declaration</tt> proclamation.
                The consequences of destructively modifying this list or
		its elements are undefined.
<P>
 </DL>
  If an implementation is extended to recognize additional
  declaration specifiers in <tt>declare</tt> or <tt>proclaim</tt>, it is required that
  either the <tt>declaration-information</tt> function should recognize those
  declarations also or the implementation should provide a similar accessor that is
  specialized for that declaration specifier.  If <tt>declaration-information</tt>
  is used to return the information, the corresponding <i>decl-name</i> must not
  be a symbol that is external in any package defined in the standard or
  that is otherwise accessible in the <tt>common-lisp-user</tt> package.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<pre>
augment-environment <i>env</i> &amp;key :variable :symbol-macro 
                    :function :macro :declare
</pre>
<P>  This function returns a new environment containing the information present in
  <i>env</i> augmented with the information provided by the keyword arguments.  It is
  intended to be used by program analyzers that perform a code walk.
<P>
  The arguments are supplied as follows.
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>:variable</tt>
<DD>
     The argument is a list of symbols that will be visible as bound variables in
                the new environment.  Whether each binding is to be interpreted
                as special or lexical depends on <tt>special</tt> declarations recorded
                in the environment or provided in the <tt>:declare</tt> argument.
<P>
<DT><tt>:symbol-macro</tt>
<DD>
 The argument is a list of symbol macro definitions, each of the form
                <tt>(<i>name</i> <i>definition</i>)</tt>; that is, the argument is
                in the same format as the
                <i>cadr</i> of a <tt>symbol-macrolet</tt> special form.  The new environment
                will have local symbol-macro bindings of each symbol to the
                corresponding expansion, so that <tt>macroexpand</tt> will be able to
                expand them properly.  A type declaration in the <tt>:declare</tt>
                argument that refers to a name in this list implicitly
                modifies the definition associated with the name.  The effect
                is to wrap a <tt>the</tt> form mentioning the type around the
                definition.
<P>
<DT><tt>:function</tt>
<DD>
     The argument is a list of function-names that will be visible as local
                function bindings in the new environment.
<P>
<DT><tt>:macro</tt>
<DD>
        The argument is a list of local macro definitions, 
        each of the form <tt>(<i>name</i> <i>definition</i>)</tt>.
        Note that the argument is <i>not</i>
                in the same format as the
                <i>cadr</i> of a <tt>macrolet</tt> special form.
                Each <i>definition</i> must be a function of two
                arguments (a form and an environment).  The new environment
                will have local macro bindings of each name to the
                corresponding expander function, which will be returned by
                <tt>macro-function</tt> and used by <tt>macroexpand</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>:declare</tt>
<DD>
      The argument is a list of declaration specifiers.
      Information about these declarations can
                be retrieved from the resulting environment using
                <tt>variable-information</tt>, <tt>function-information</tt>, and
                <tt>declaration-information</tt>.
<P>
 </DL>
  The consequences of subsequently
  destructively modifying the list
  structure of any of the arguments to this function are undefined.
<P>
  An error is signaled if any of the symbols naming a symbol macro in the
  <tt>:symbol-macro</tt> argument is also included in the <tt>:variable</tt> argument.
  An error is
  signaled if any symbol naming a symbol macro in the <tt>:symbol-macro</tt> argument is
  also included in a <tt>special</tt> declaration specifier in the <tt>:declare</tt> argument.
  An error is
  signaled if any symbol naming a macro in the <tt>:macro</tt> argument is also included
  in the <tt>:function</tt> argument.
  The condition type of each of these errors is <tt>program-error</tt>.
<P>
  The extent of the returned environment is the same as the extent of the
  argument environment <i>env</i>.  The result might share structure with <i>env</i>
  but <i>env</i> is not modified.
<P>
  While an environment argument received by an <tt>*evalhook*</tt>
  function is permitted to be used as the
  environment argument to <tt>augment-environment</tt>, the consequences are undefined if an
  attempt is made to use the result of <tt>augment-environment</tt> as the environment
  argument for <tt>evalhook</tt>.  The environment
  returned by <tt>augment-environment</tt> can be used only for syntactic analysis, that is,
  as an argument to
  the functions defined in this section and functions such as <tt>macroexpand</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Macro]</b><BR>
<tt>define-declaration</tt> <tt><i>decl-name</i></tt> <tt><i>lambda-list</i></tt> <tt>{<i>form</i>}*</tt><P>  This macro defines a handler for the named declaration.  It is the mechanism by which
  <tt>augment-environment</tt> is extended to support additional declaration
  specifiers.  The function defined by this macro will be called with two
  arguments, a declaration specifier whose <i>car</i> is <i>decl-name</i>
  and the <i>env</i> argument to
  <tt>augment-environment</tt>.  This function must return two values.  The
  first value must be one of the following keywords:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><tt>:variable</tt>
<DD>     The declaration applies to variable bindings.
<DT><tt>:function</tt>
<DD>     The declaration applies to function bindings.
<DT><tt>:declare</tt>
<DD>      The declaration does not apply to bindings.
<P>
 </DL>
If the first value is <tt>:variable</tt> or <tt>:function</tt>
then the second value must be a list, the elements of which are lists of the
  form <tt>(<i>binding-name</i> <i>key</i> <i>value</i>)</tt>.  If the corresponding information
  function (either <tt>variable-information</tt> or <tt>function-information</tt>) is applied to
  the <i>binding-name</i> and the augmented environment, the a-list returned
  by the information function as its third value will contain the <i>value</i>
  under the specified <i>key</i>.
<P>
  If the first value is <tt>:declare</tt>, the second value must be a cons
  of the form <tt>(<i>key</i> . <i>value</i>)</tt>.  The function
  <tt>declaration-information</tt> will return <i>value</i> when applied to the
  <i>key</i> and the augmented environment.
<P>
  <tt>define-declaration</tt> causes <i>decl-name</i> to be proclaimed to be a
  declaration; it is as if its expansion included a call <tt>(proclaim
  '(declaration <i>decl-name</i>))</tt>.  As is the case with standard
  declaration specifiers, the evaluator and compiler are permitted,
  but not required, to add information about declaration specifiers
  defined with <tt>define-declaration</tt> to the macro expansion and <tt>*evalhook*</tt>
  environments.
<P>
  The consequences are undefined if <i>decl-name</i> is a symbol that can
  appear as the <i>car</i> of any standard declaration specifier.
<P>
  The consequences are also undefined if the return value from a 
  declaration handler defined with <tt>define-declaration</tt> includes a <i>key</i> name
  that is used by the corresponding accessor to return information about
  any standard declaration specifier.  (For example, if
  the first return value from the handler is <tt>:variable</tt>, the second return
  value may not use the symbols <tt>dynamic-extent</tt>, <tt>ignore</tt>, or <tt>type</tt>
  as <i>key</i> names.)
<P>
  The <tt>define-declaration</tt> macro does not have any special compile-time
  side effects (see section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>parse-macro <i>name</i> <i>lambda-list</i> <i>body</i> &amp;optional <i>env</i></tt><P>  This function is used to process a macro definition in the same way
  as <tt>defmacro</tt> and <tt>macrolet</tt>.  It returns a lambda-expression that accepts
  two arguments, a form and an environment.  The <i>name</i>, <i>lambda-list</i>,
  and <i>body</i> arguments correspond to the parts of a <tt>defmacro</tt> or <tt>macrolet</tt>
  definition.
<P>
  The <i>lambda-list</i> argument may include <tt>&amp;environment</tt> and <tt>&amp;whole</tt>
  and may include destructuring.
  The <i>name</i>
  argument is used to enclose the <i>body</i> in an implicit <tt>block</tt> and might also
  be used for implementation-dependent purposes (such as including the name of
  the macro in error messages if the form does not match the <i>lambda-list</i>).
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>

  in a syntactic
  environment <i>env</i>.  The <i>lambda-expression</i> is permitted to reference only the
  parts of the environment argument <i>env</i> that are relevant only to syntactic
  processing, specifically declarations and the definitions of macros and
  symbol macros.  The consequences are undefined if the <i>lambda-expression</i>
  contains any references to variable or function bindings that are
