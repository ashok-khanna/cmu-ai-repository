<A NAME=CHARACTERINPUTSECTION>Many</A>
character
input functions take optional arguments called <i>input-stream</i>,
<i>eof-error-p</i>, and <i>eof-value</i>.  The <i>input-stream</i> argument is the
stream from
which to obtain input; if unsupplied or <tt>nil</tt> it defaults to the value of
the special variable <tt>*standard-input*</tt>.  One may also specify <tt>t</tt>
as a stream, meaning the value of the special variable
<tt>*terminal-io*</tt>.
<P>
The <i>eof-error-p</i> argument
controls what happens if input is from a file (or any other
input source that has a definite end) and the end of the file is reached.
If <i>eof-error-p</i> is true (the default), an error will be signaled
at end of file.  If it is false, then no error is signaled, and instead
the function returns <i>eof-value</i>.

(ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIED) <A NAME=22837>&#160;</A> 
to clarify that an <i>eof-value</i> argument
may be any Lisp datum whatsoever.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
Functions such as <tt>read</tt> that read the representation
of an object rather than a single
character will always signal an error, regardless of <i>eof-error-p</i>, if
the file ends in the middle of an object representation.
For example, if a file does
not contain enough right parentheses to balance the left parentheses in
it, <tt>read</tt> will complain.  If a file ends in a symbol or a number
immediately followed by end-of-file, <tt>read</tt> will read the symbol or
number successfully and when called again will see the end-of-file and
only then act according to <i>eof-error-p</i>.
Similarly, the function <tt>read-line</tt>
will successfully read the last line of a file even if that line
is terminated by end-of-file rather than the newline character.
If a file contains ignorable text at the end, such
as blank lines and comments, <tt>read</tt> will not consider it to end in the
middle of an object.
Thus an <i>eof-error-p</i> argument controls what happens
when the file ends <i>between</i> objects.
<P>
Many input functions also take an argument called <i>recursive-p</i>.
If specified and not <tt>nil</tt>, this argument specifies that
this call is not a ``top-level'' call to <tt>read</tt> but an imbedded call,
typically from the function for a macro character.
It is important to distinguish such recursive calls for three reasons.
<P>
First, a top-level call establishes the context within which the
<tt>#<i>n</i>=</tt> and <tt>#<i>n</i>#</tt> syntax is scoped.  Consider, for example,
the expression
<P><pre>
(cons '#3=(p q r) '(x y . #3#))
</pre><P>
If the single-quote macro character were defined in this way:
<P><pre>
(set-macro-character #\' 
                     #'(lambda (stream char) 
                         (declare (ignore char)) 
                         (list 'quote (read stream))))
</pre><P>
then the expression could not be read properly, because there would be no way
to know when <tt>read</tt> is called recursively by the first
occurrence of <tt>'</tt> that the label <tt>#3=</tt> would be referred to
later in the containing expression.
There would be no way to know because <tt>read</tt>
could not determine that it was called by a macro-character function
rather than from ``top level.''  The correct way to define the single quote
macro character uses the <i>recursive-p</i> argument:
<P><pre>
(set-macro-character #\' 
                     #'(lambda (stream char) 
                         (declare (ignore char)) 
                         (list 'quote (read stream t nil t))))
</pre><P>
<P>
Second, a recursive call does not alter whether the reading process
is to preserve whitespace or not (as determined by whether the
top-level call was to <tt>read</tt> or <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>).
Suppose again that the single quote had the first, incorrect, macro-character
definition shown above.  Then a call to <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>
that read the expression <tt>'foo </tt> would fail to preserve the space
character following the symbol <tt>foo</tt> because the single-quote
macro-character function calls <tt>read</tt>, not <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>,
to read the following expression (in this case <tt>foo</tt>).
The correct definition, which passes the value <tt>t</tt> for the <i>recursive-p</i>
argument to <tt>read</tt>, allows the top-level call to determine
whether whitespace is preserved.
<P>
Third, when end-of-file is encountered and the <i>eof-error-p</i> argument
is not <tt>nil</tt>, the kind of error that is signaled may depend on the value
of <i>recursive-p</i>.  If <i>recursive-p</i> is not <tt>nil</tt>, then the end-of-file
is deemed to have occurred within the middle of a printed representation;
if <i>recursive-p</i> is <tt>nil</tt>, then the end-of-file may be deemed to have
occurred between objects rather than within the middle of one.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>read &amp;optional <i>input-stream</i> <i>eof-error-p</i> <i>eof-value</i> <i>recursive-p</i></tt><P><tt>read</tt> reads in the printed representation of a Lisp object
from <i>input-stream</i>, builds a corresponding Lisp object, and returns
the object.
<P>
Note that when the variable <tt>*read-suppress*</tt> is not <tt>nil</tt>,
then <tt>read</tt> reads in a printed representation as best it can,
but most of the work of interpreting the representation is avoided
(the intent being that the result is to be discarded anyway).
For example, all extended tokens produce the result <tt>nil</tt> regardless
of their syntax.
<P>
<BR><b>[Variable]</b><BR>
<tt>*read-default-float-format*</tt><P>The value of this variable must be a type specifier symbol for
a specific floating-point format; these include
<tt>short-float</tt>, <tt>single-float</tt>,
<tt>double-float</tt>, and <tt>long-float</tt> and may include implementation-specific
types as well.  The default value is <tt>single-float</tt>.
<P>
<tt>*read-default-float-format*</tt>
indicates the floating-point format to be used
for reading floating-point numbers that have no exponent marker or have
<tt>e</tt> or <tt>E</tt> for an exponent marker.  (Other exponent markers
explicitly prescribe the floating-point format to be used.)
The printer also uses this variable to guide the choice of exponent
markers when printing floating-point numbers.
<P>

<tt>read-preserving-whitespace &amp;optional <i>in-stream</i> <i>eof-error-p</i> <i>eof-value</i> <i>recursive-p</i> </tt><P>Certain printed representations given to <tt>read</tt>, notably those of symbols
and numbers, require a delimiting character after them.  (Lists do not, because
the close parenthesis marks the end of the list.)
Normally <tt>read</tt> will throw away the delimiting character if it is a
whitespace character;
but <tt>read</tt> will preserve the character (using <tt>unread-char</tt>) if it is
syntactically meaningful, because it may be the start of the next expression.

of <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
The function <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt> is provided for some specialized
situations where it is desirable to determine precisely what character
terminated the extended token.
<P>
As an example, consider this macro-character definition:
<P><pre>
(defun slash-reader (stream char) 
  (declare (ignore char)) 
  (do ((path (list (read-preserving-whitespace stream)) 
             (cons (progn (read-char stream nil nil t) 
                          (read-preserving-whitespace 
                             stream)) 
                   path))) 
      ((not (char= (peek-char nil stream nil nil t) #\/)) 
       (cons 'path (nreverse path))))) 
(set-macro-character #\/ #'slash-reader)
</pre><P>
(This is actually a rather dangerous definition to make because
expressions such as <tt>(/ x 3)</tt> will no longer be read properly.
The ability to reprogram the reader syntax is very powerful and
must be used with caution.  This redefinition of <tt>/</tt> is shown
here purely for the sake of example.)
<P>
Consider now calling <tt>read</tt> on this expression:
<P><pre>
(zyedh /usr/games/zork /usr/games/boggle)
</pre><P>
The <tt>/</tt> macro reads objects separated by more <tt>/</tt> characters;
thus <tt>/usr/games/zork</tt> is intended to be read as <tt>(path usr games zork)</tt>.
The entire example expression should therefore be read as
<P><pre>
(zyedh (path usr games zork) (path usr games boggle))
</pre><P>
However, if <tt>read</tt> had been used instead of
<tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>, then after the reading of the symbol
<tt>zork</tt>, the following space would be discarded; the next call
to <tt>peek-char</tt> would see the following <tt>/</tt>, and the loop would
continue, producing this interpretation:
<P><pre>
(zyedh (path usr games zork usr games boggle))
</pre><P>
On the other hand, there are times when whitespace <i>should</i> be discarded.
If a command interpreter takes single-character commands,
but occasionally reads a Lisp object, then if the whitespace
after a symbol is not discarded it might be interpreted as a command
some time later after the symbol had been read.
<P>
Note that <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt> behaves <i>exactly</i> like <tt>read</tt>
when the <i>recursive-p</i> argument is not <tt>nil</tt>.  The distinction is established
only by calls with <i>recursive-p</i> equal to <tt>nil</tt> or omitted.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>read-delimited-list <i>char</i> &amp;optional <i>input-stream</i> <i>recursive-p</i></tt><P>This reads objects from <i>stream</i> until the next character after an object's
representation (ignoring whitespace characters and comments) is <i>char</i>.
(The <i>char</i> should not have whitespace syntax in the current
readtable.)
A list of the objects read is returned.
<P>
To be more precise, <tt>read-delimited-list</tt> looks ahead at each step
for the next non-whitespace character and peeks at it
as if with <tt>peek-char</tt>.  If it is <i>char</i>, then the
character is consumed and the list of objects is returned.
If it is a constituent or escape character, then <tt>read</tt> is used
to read an object, which is added to the end of the list.
If it is a macro character, the associated macro function
is called; if the function returns a value, that value is added
to the list.  The peek-ahead process is then repeated.

of the function <tt>read-delimited-list</tt>.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
This function is particularly useful for defining new macro characters.
Usually it is desirable for the terminating character <i>char</i> to be a
terminating macro character so that it may be used to delimit tokens;
however, <tt>read-delimited-list</tt> makes no attempt to alter the syntax
specified for <i>char</i> by the current readtable.  The user must make any
necessary changes to the readtable syntax explicitly.  The following
example illustrates this.
<P>
Suppose you wanted <tt>#{<i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> ... <i>z</i>}</tt>
to be read as a list of all pairs of the elements <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <tt>...</tt>,
<i>z</i>; for example:
<P><pre>
#{p q z a}  reads as  ((p q) (p z) (p a) (q z) (q a) (z a))
</pre><P>
This can be done by specifying a macro-character definition for <tt>#{</tt>
that does two things: read in all the items up to the <tt>}</tt>,
and construct the pairs.  <tt>read-delimited-list</tt> performs
the first task.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
Note that <tt>mapcon</tt> allows the mapped function to examine
the items of the list after the current one, and that
<tt>mapcon</tt> uses <tt>nconc</tt>, which is all right because <tt>mapcar</tt>
will produce fresh lists.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">

</pre><P>
(Note that <tt>t</tt> is specified for the <i>recursive-p</i> argument.)
<P>
It is necessary here to give a definition to the character <tt>}</tt> as
well to prevent it from being a constituent.
If the line
<P><pre>
(set-macro-character #\} (get-macro-character #\) <tt>nil</tt>))
</pre><P>
shown above were not included, then the <tt>}</tt> in
<P><pre>
#{p q z a}
</pre><P>
would be considered a constituent character, part of the symbol named
<tt>a}</tt>.  One could correct for this by putting a space before
the <tt>}</tt>, but it is better simply to use the call to
<tt>set-macro-character</tt>.
<P>
Giving <tt>}</tt> the same
definition as the standard definition of the character <tt>)</tt> has the
twin benefit of making it terminate tokens for use with <tt>read-delimited-list</tt>
and also making it illegal for use in any other context (that is, attempting to
read a stray <tt>}</tt> will signal an error).
<P>
Note that <tt>read-delimited-list</tt> does not take an <i>eof-error-p</i>
(or <i>eof-value</i>)
argument.  The reason is that it is always an error
to hit end-of-file during the operation of <tt>read-delimited-list</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>read-line &amp;optional <i>input-stream</i> <i>eof-error-p</i> <i>eof-value</i> <i>recursive-p</i> </tt><P><tt>read-line</tt> reads in a line of text terminated by a newline.
It returns the line as a character string (<i>without</i> the newline character).
This function is usually used to get a line of input from the user.
A second returned value is a flag that is false if the line was
terminated normally, or true if end-of-file terminated the (non-empty) line.
If end-of-file is encountered immediately (that is, appears to terminate
an empty line), then end-of-file processing is controlled in the
usual way by the <i>eof-error-p</i>, <i>eof-value</i>, and <i>recursive-p</i> arguments.

<b>Rationale:</b> This is not intended to be a general mechanism, but rather
an efficient mechanism for allowing the Lisp reader and other parsers
to perform one-character lookahead in the input stream.
This protocol admits a wide variety of efficient implementations,
such as simply decrementing a buffer pointer.
To have to specify the character in the call to <tt>unread-char</tt> is
admittedly redundant, since at any given time there is only one character
that may be legally specified.  The redundancy is intentional,
again to give the implementation latitude.

<tt>peek-char &amp;optional <i>peek-type</i> <i>input-stream</i> <i>eof-error-p</i> <i>eof-value</i> <i>recursive-p</i> </tt><P>What <tt>peek-char</tt> does depends on the <i>peek-type</i>, which
defaults to <tt>nil</tt>.  With a <i>peek-type</i> of <tt>nil</tt>,
<tt>peek-char</tt> returns the next character to be read from 
<i>input-stream</i>, without actually removing it from the input stream.
The next time input is done from <i>input-stream</i>, the character will still

If <i>peek-type</i> is <tt>t</tt>, then <tt>peek-char</tt> skips over whitespace
characters (but not comments)
and then performs the peeking operation on the next
character.
This is useful for finding the (possible) beginning
of the next printed representation of a Lisp object.
The last character examined (the one that starts an object)
is not removed from the input stream.
<P>
If <i>peek-type</i> is a character object, then <tt>peek-char</tt> skips

This is particularly useful when the stream obtains characters
from an interactive device such as a keyboard.  A call to <tt>read-char</tt>
would simply wait until a character was available, but <tt>listen</tt> can
sense whether or not input is available and allow the program to

This is different from the <tt>listen</tt> operation in
two ways.  First, <tt>read-char-no-hang</tt> potentially reads a character,
whereas <tt>listen</tt> never inputs a character.  Second,

for <tt>read-preserving-whitespace</tt>.  It defaults to <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
As with other reading functions,
the arguments <i>eof-error-p</i> and <i>eof-value</i> control the action
if the end of the (sub)string is reached
before the operation is completed;
reaching the end of the string is treated as any other end-of-file event.
<P>
<tt>read-from-string</tt> returns two values: the first is the object read,
and the second is the index of the first character in the string not
read.  If the entire string was read, the second result
will be either the length of
the string or one greater than the length of the string.  The parameter
<tt>:preserve-whitespace</tt> may affect this second value.

<tt>parse-integer <i>string</i> &amp;key :start :end :radix :junk-allowed</tt><P>This function examines the substring of <i>string</i> delimited by <tt>:start</tt>
and <tt>:end</tt> (which default to the beginning and end of the string).
It skips over whitespace characters and then attempts to
parse an integer.  The <tt>:radix</tt> parameter defaults to <tt>10</tt>
and must be an integer between 2 and 36.
<P>
If <tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is not <tt>nil</tt>, then the first value
returned is the value of the number parsed
as an integer or <tt>nil</tt> if no syntactically correct integer
was seen.
<P>
If <tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is <tt>nil</tt> (the default), then the entire substring is scanned.
The returned value is the value of the number parsed as an integer.
An error is signaled if the substring does not consist entirely of
the representation of an integer, possibly surrounded on either side by
whitespace characters.
<P>
In either case, the second value is the index into the string of the delimiter
that terminated the parse, or it is the index beyond the substring if the
parse terminated at the end of the substring (as will always be the case if
<tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is false).
<P>
Note that <tt>parse-integer</tt> does not recognize the syntactic radix-specifier
prefixes <tt>#O</tt>, <tt>#B</tt>, <tt>#X</tt>, and <tt>#<i>n</i>R</tt>, nor does it recognize
a trailing decimal point.  It permits only an optional sign
(<tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt>) followed
by a non-empty sequence of digits in the specified radix.
