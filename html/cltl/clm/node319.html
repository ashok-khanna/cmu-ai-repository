<A NAME=OBJECT0RIENTEDBASIS>Of</A>
course, the ability of the handler to usefully handle an exceptional
situation is related to the quality of the information it is provided. For
example, if all errors were signaled by
<P><pre>
(error &quot;<i>some format string</i>&quot;)
</pre><P>
then the only piece of information that would be accessible to the handler
would be an object of type <tt>simple-error</tt> that had a slot containing the
format string.
<P>
If this were done, <tt>string-equal</tt> would be the preferred way to tell one error
from another, and it would be very hard to allow flexibility in the
presentation of error messages because existing handlers would tend to be
broken by even tiny variations in the wording of an error message. This
phenomenon has been the major failing of most error systems previously
available in Lisp. It is fundamentally important to decouple the error
message string (the human interface) from the objects that formally
represent the error state (the program interface). We therefore have the
notion of typed conditions, and of formal operations on those conditions
that make them inspectable in a structured way.
<P>
This object-oriented approach to condition handling has the following
important advantages over a text-based approach:
<UL><LI>
   Conditions are classified according to subtype relationships, making
   it easy to test for categories of conditions.
<P>
<LI>
   Conditions have named slot values through which parameters are conveyed
   from the program that signals the condition to the program that handles it.
<P>
<LI>
   Inheritance of methods and slots reduces the amount of explicit
   specification necessary to achieve various interesting effects.
</UL>
<P>
Some condition types are defined by this document, but the set of 
condition types is extensible using <tt>define-condition</tt>.
Common Lisp condition types are in fact CLOS classes, and condition objects
are ordinary CLOS objects; <tt>define-condition</tt> merely
provides an abstract interface that is a bit more convenient than
<tt>defclass</tt> for defining conditions.
<P>
Here, as an example,
we define a two-argument function called <tt>divide</tt> that is patterned after
the <tt>/</tt> function but does some stylized error checking:
<P><pre>
(defun divide (numerator denominator) 
  (cond ((or (not (numberp numerator)) 
             (not (numberp denominator))) 
         (error &quot;(DIVIDE '~S '~S) - Bad arguments.&quot; 
                numerator denominator)) 
        ((zerop denominator) 
         (error 'division-by-zero 
                :operator 'divide 
                :operands (list numerator denominator))) 
        (t ...)))
</pre><P>
Note that in the first clause we have used <tt>error</tt> with a string argument
and in the second clause we have named a particular condition type,
<tt>division-by-zero</tt>. In the case of a string argument, the condition type that
will be signaled is <tt>simple-error</tt>.
<P>
The particular kind of error that is signaled may be important
in cases where handlers are active. For example, <tt>simple-error</tt> inherits 
from type <tt>error</tt>, which in turn inherits from type <tt>condition</tt>. On the 
other hand, <tt>division-by-zero</tt> inherits from <tt>arithmetic-error</tt>, which 
inherits from <tt>error</tt>, which inherits from <tt>condition</tt>. So if a handler
existed for <tt>arithmetic-error</tt> while a <tt>division-by-zero</tt> condition was
signaled, that handler would be tried; however, if a <tt>simple-error</tt>
condition were signaled in the same context, the handler for type
<tt>arithmetic-error</tt> would not be tried.
