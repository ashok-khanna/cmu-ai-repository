<P>
Symbols can be used in two rather different ways.
An <i>interned</i> symbol is one that is indexed by its print name
in a catalogue called a <i>package</i>.
A request to locate a symbol with that print name results
in the same (<tt>eq</tt>) symbol.  Every time input is read with the
function <tt>read</tt>,
and that print name appears, it is read as the same symbol.
This property of symbols makes them appropriate to use as names for
things and as hooks on which to hang permanent data objects
(using the property list, for example).
<P>
Interned symbols are normally created automatically; the first time
something (such as the function <tt>read</tt>)
asks the package system for a symbol with a given print name,
that symbol is automatically created.  The function used to ask for
an interned symbol is <tt>intern</tt>, or one of the functions
related to <tt>intern</tt>.
<P>
Although interned symbols are the most commonly
used, they will not be discussed further here.  For more information,
see chapter <A HREF="node111.html#XPACK">11</A>.
<P>
An <i>uninterned</i> symbol is a symbol used simply as a data object,
with no special cataloguing (it belongs to no particular package).
An uninterned symbol is printed as <tt>#:</tt> followed by its
print name.
The following are some functions for creating uninterned symbols.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>make-symbol <i>print-name</i></tt><P><tt>(make-symbol <i>print-name</i>)</tt> creates a new uninterned symbol, whose
print name is the string <i>print-name</i>.  The value and function bindings will
be unbound and the property list will be empty.
<P>
The string actually installed in the symbol's print-name component
may be the given string <i>print-name</i> or may be a copy of it,
at the implementation's discretion.  The user should not assume
that <tt>(symbol-name (make-symbol x))</tt> is <tt>eq</tt> to <tt>x</tt>, but also
should not alter a string once it has been given as an argument
to <tt>make-symbol</tt>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> An implementation might choose, for example,
to copy the string to some read-only area, in the expectation that
it will never be altered.
<hr>
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>copy-symbol <i>sym</i> &amp;optional <i>copy-props</i></tt><P>This returns a new uninterned symbol with the same print name
as <i>sym</i>.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (COPY-SYMBOL-PRINT-NAME) <A NAME=10041>&#160;</A> 
that the print name of the new symbol is required to be
the same only in the sense of <tt>string=</tt>; in other words,
an implementation is permitted (but not required)
to make a copy of the print name.
User programs should not assume that the print names of the old and new symbols
will be <tt>eq</tt>, although they may happen to be <tt>eq</tt> in some implementations.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
If <i>copy-props</i> is non-<tt>nil</tt>, then the initial
value and function definition of the new symbol will
be the same as those of <i>sym</i>, and the property list of
the new symbol will be a copy of <i>sym</i>'s.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (COPY-SYMBOL-COPY-PLIST) <A NAME=10051>&#160;</A> 
to clarify that only the top-level conses of the
property list are copied; it is as if <tt>(copy-list (symbol-plist <i>sym</i>))</tt>
were used as the property list of the new symbol.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
If <i>copy-props</i>
is <tt>nil</tt> (the default), then the new symbol will be unbound and undefined, and
its property list will be empty.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>gensym &amp;optional <i>x</i></tt><P><tt>gensym</tt> invents a print name and creates a new symbol with that print name.
It returns the new, uninterned symbol.
<P>
The invented print name consists of a prefix
(which defaults to <tt>G</tt>), followed by the decimal representation of a number.
<p>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
The number is increased by 1 every time <tt>gensym</tt> is called.
<P>
If the argument <i>x</i> is present and is an integer, then <i>x</i> must be
non-negative, and the internal counter is set to <i>x</i> for future use;
otherwise the internal counter is incremented.
If <i>x</i> is a string, then that string is made the default prefix
for this and future calls to <tt>gensym</tt>.
After handling the argument, <tt>gensym</tt> creates a
symbol as it would with no argument.
For example:
<P><pre>
(gensym) => G7 
(gensym &quot;FOO-&quot;) => FOO-8 
(gensym 32) => FOO-32 
(gensym) => FOO-33 
(gensym &quot;GARBAGE-&quot;) => GARBAGE-34
</pre>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_end" src="gif/old_change_end.gif">
<P>
<tt>gensym</tt> is usually used to create a symbol that should not normally
be seen by the user and whose print name is unimportant except to
allow easy distinction by eye between two such symbols.
The optional argument is rarely supplied.
The name comes from ``generate symbol,'' and the symbols produced by it
are often called ``gensyms.''
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> In earlier versions of Lisp, such as MacLisp and
Interlisp, the print name of a gensym was of fixed length, consisting
of a single letter and a fixed-length
decimal representation with leading zeros
if necessary, for example, <tt>G0007</tt>.  This convention was
motivated by an implementation consideration, namely that the name
should fit into a single machine word, allowing a quick and clever
implementation.  Such considerations are less relevant in Common Lisp.
The consistent use of mnemonic prefixes can make it easier
for the programmer, when debugging, to determine what code generated
a particular symbol.  The elimination of the fixed-length decimal
representation prevents the same name from being used twice
unless the counter is explicitly reset.
<hr>
<P>
If it is desirable
for the generated symbols to be interned, and yet guaranteed to be
symbols distinct from all others,
then the function <tt>gentemp</tt>
may be more appropriate to use.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (GENSYM-NAME-STICKINESS) <A NAME=10077>&#160;</A> 
to alter the specification of <tt>gensym</tt> so that supplying an
optional argument (whether a string or a number) does <i>not</i> alter
the internal state maintained by <tt>gensym</tt>.
Instead, the internal
counter is made explicitly available as a variable named <tt>*gensym-counter*</tt>.
<P>
If a string argument is given to <tt>gensym</tt>, that string is used as the prefix;
otherwise ``<tt>G</tt>'' is used.  If a number is provided, its decimal
representation is used, but the internal counter is unaffected.
X3J13 deprecates the use of a number as an argument.
<P>
<BR><b>[Variable]</b><BR>
<tt>*gensym-counter*</tt><P>X3J13 voted in March 1989 (GENSYM-NAME-STICKINESS) <A NAME=10088>&#160;</A> 
to add <tt>*gensym-counter*</tt>, which
holds the state of the <tt>gensym</tt> counter; that is, <tt>gensym</tt>
uses the decimal representation of its value as part of the generated name
and then increments its value.
<P>
The initial value of this variable is implementation-dependent
but will be a non-negative integer.
<P>
The user may assign to or bind this variable at any time, but its value
must always be a non-negative integer.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>gentemp &amp;optional <i>prefix</i> <i>package</i></tt><P><tt>gentemp</tt>, like <tt>gensym</tt>, creates and returns a new symbol.
<tt>gentemp</tt> differs from <tt>gensym</tt> in that it interns the symbol
(see <tt>intern</tt>) in the <i>package</i> (which defaults to the current
package; see <tt>*package*</tt>).  <tt>gentemp</tt> guarantees the symbol
will be a new one not already existing in the package.  It does this
by using a counter as <tt>gensym</tt> does, but if the generated symbol
is not really new, then the process is repeated until a new one is created.
There is no provision for resetting the <tt>gentemp</tt> counter.
Also, the prefix for <tt>gentemp</tt> is not remembered from one call
to the next; if <i>prefix</i> is omitted, the default prefix <tt>T</tt> is used.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>symbol-package <i>sym</i></tt><P>Given a symbol <i>sym</i>, <tt>symbol-package</tt> returns the contents of the
package cell of that symbol.  This will be a package object or <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>keywordp <i>object</i></tt><P>The argument may be any Lisp object.  The predicate <tt>keywordp</tt> is true
if the argument is a symbol and that
symbol is a keyword (that is, belongs to the keyword
package).  Keywords are those symbols that are written with
a leading colon.  Every keyword is a constant, in the sense
that it always evaluates to itself.  See <tt>constantp</tt>.
