X3J13 voted in June 1989 (COMPILE-ENVIRONMENT-CONSISTENCY) <A NAME=28618>&#160;</A> 
to specify what information must be available at compile time
for correct compilation
and what need not be available until run time.
<P>
The following information must be present in the compile-time
environment for a program to be compiled correctly.  This
information need not also be present in the run-time environment.
<UL><LI> In conforming code, macros referenced in the code being compiled
        must have been previously defined in the compile-time environment.
	The compiler must treat as a function call any form that is a list whose <i>car</i> is
	a symbol that does not name a macro or special form.
  (This implies that <tt>setf</tt> methods must also be available at
	compile time.)
<P>
<LI> In conforming code, proclamations for <tt>special</tt> variables must
        be made in the compile-time environment before any bindings of
        those variables are processed by the compiler.  The compiler
        must treat any binding of an undeclared variable as a lexical
        binding.
</UL>
<P>
The compiler may incorporate the following kinds of information
into the code it produces, if the information is present in the
compile-time environment and is referenced within the code being
compiled; however, the compiler is not required to do so.
When compile-time and run-time definitions differ, it is
unspecified which will prevail within the compiled code
(unless some other behavior is explicitly specified below).  It is also
permissible for an implementation to signal an error at run time on
detecting such a discrepancy.  In all cases, the absence of the
information at compile time is not an error, but its presence may
enable the compiler to generate more efficient code.
<UL><LI> The compiler may assume that functions that are defined and
	declared <tt>inline</tt> in the compile-time environment will retain the
        same definitions at run time.
<P>
<LI> The compiler may assume that, within a named function, a
	recursive call to a function of the same name refers to the
	same function, unless that function has been declared <tt>notinline</tt>.
(This permits tail-recursive calls of a function to itself
to be compiled as jumps, for example, thereby turning certain recursive
schemas into efficient loops.)
<P>
<LI> In the absence of <tt>notinline</tt>
	declarations to the contrary,
 <tt>compile-file</tt> may assume that a call within the file being compiled to a named
	function that is defined in that file refers to that function.
	(This rule permits <i>block compilation</i> of files.)  The behavior of
	the program is unspecified if functions are redefined individually 
	at run time.
<P>
<LI> The compiler may assume that the signature (or ``interface contract'') of
	all built-in Common Lisp functions will not change.  In addition,
	the compiler may treat all built-in Common Lisp functions as if
	they had been proclaimed <tt>inline</tt>.
<P>
<LI> The compiler may assume that the signature (or ``interface contract'') of
	functions with <tt>ftype</tt> information available will not change.
<P>
<LI> The compiler may ``wire in'' (that is, open-code or inline)
the values of symbolic constants
	that have been defined with <tt>defconstant</tt> in the compile-time
	environment.
<P>
<LI> The compiler may assume that any type definition made with <tt>defstruct</tt> 
        or <tt>deftype</tt> in the compile-time environment will retain the same 
        definition in the run-time environment.  It may also assume that
        a class defined by <tt>defclass</tt> in the compile-time environment will
        be defined in the run-time environment in such a way as to have
        the same superclasses and metaclass.  This implies that
        subtype/supertype relationships of type specifiers will not 
        change between compile time and run time.  (Note that it is not 
        an error for an	unknown type to appear in a declaration at
        compile time, although it is reasonable for the compiler to 
        emit a warning in such a case.)
<P>
<LI> The compiler may assume that if type declarations are present
	in the compile-time environment, the corresponding variables and 
	functions present in the run-time environment will actually be of
	those types.  If this assumption is violated, the run-time behavior of the program is 
	undefined.
</UL>
<P>
The compiler must not make any additional assumptions about
consistency between the compile-time and run-time environments.  In 
particular, the compiler may not assume that functions that are defined
	in the compile-time environment will retain either the
	same definition or the same signature at run time, except
as described above.
Similarly,
the compiler may not signal an error if it sees a call to a
	function that is not defined at compile time, since that function
	may be provided at run time.
<P>
X3J13 voted in January 1989 (COMPILE-FILE-HANDLING-OF-TOP-LEVEL-FORMS) <A NAME=28637>&#160;</A> 
to specify the compile-time side effects of processing various macro forms.
<P>
Calls to defining macros such as <tt>defmacro</tt> or <tt>defvar</tt> appearing
    within a file being processed by <tt>compile-file</tt> normally have
    compile-time side effects that affect how subsequent forms in the
    same file are compiled.  A convenient model for explaining how these
    side effects happen is that each defining macro expands into one or
    more <tt>eval-when</tt> forms and that compile-time
    side effects are caused by calls occurring in the body of an
    <tt>(eval-when (:compile-toplevel) ...)</tt> form.
<P>
The affected defining macros and their specific side effects are
    as follows.  In each case, it is identified what a user must do to
    ensure that a program is conforming, and what a compiler must do
    in order to correctly process a conforming program.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>deftype</tt>
<DD>
The user must ensure that the body of a <tt>deftype</tt> form is
    evaluable at compile time if the type is referenced in subsequent type
    declarations.  The compiler must ensure that a type
    specifier defined by <tt>deftype</tt>
    is recognized in subsequent type declarations.  If the
    expansion of a type specifier is not defined fully at compile time
    (perhaps because it expands into an unknown type specifier or a
    <tt>satisfies</tt> of a named function that isn't defined in the compile-time
    environment), an implementation may ignore any references to this type
    in declarations and may signal a warning.
<P>
<DT><tt>defmacro</tt> and <tt>define-modify-macro</tt>
<DD>   
The compiler must store macro
    definitions at compile time, so that occurrences of the macro later on
    in the file can be expanded correctly.  The user must ensure that the
    body of the macro is evaluable at compile time if it is referenced
    within the file being compiled.
<P>
<DT><tt>defun</tt>
<DD>
No required compile-time side effects are associated with <tt>defun</tt> forms.
    In particular, <tt>defun</tt> does not make the function definition available
    at compile time.  An implementation may choose to store information
    about the function for the purposes of compile-time error checking
    (such as checking the number of arguments on calls) or to permit later
    <tt>inline</tt> expansion of the function.
<P>
<DT><tt>defvar</tt> and <tt>defparameter</tt>
<DD>
The compiler must recognize that the variables
    named by these forms have been proclaimed <tt>special</tt>.  However, it must
    not evaluate the <i>initial-value</i> form or <tt>set</tt> the variable at compile
    time.
<P>
<DT><tt>defconstant</tt>
<DD>
The compiler must recognize that the symbol names a
    constant.  An implementation may choose to evaluate the <i>value-form</i> at
    compile time, load time, or both.  Therefore the user must ensure that
    the <i>value-form</i> is evaluable at compile time (regardless of whether or
    not references to the constant appear in the file) and that it always
    evaluates to the same value.  
    (There has been considerable
variance among implementations on this point.  The effect of this specification is
to legitimize all of the implementation variants by requiring care of the user.)
<P>
<DT><tt>defsetf</tt> and <tt>define-setf-method</tt>
<DD>
The compiler must make <tt>setf</tt> methods
    available so that they may be used to expand calls to <tt>setf</tt> later on in
    the file.  Users must ensure that the body of a call
    to <tt>define-setf-method</tt> or
    the complex form of <tt>defsetf</tt> is evaluable at compile time if the
    corresponding place is referred to in a subsequent <tt>setf</tt> in the same
    file.  The compiler must make these <tt>setf</tt> methods available to 
    compile-time calls to <tt>get-setf-method</tt> when its environment argument is
    a value received as the <tt>&amp;environment</tt> parameter of a macro.
<P>
<DT><tt>defstruct</tt>
<DD>
The compiler must make the structure type name recognized
    as a valid type name in subsequent declarations (as described above
    for <tt>deftype</tt>) and
    make the structure slot accessors known to <tt>setf</tt>.
    In addition, the
    compiler must save enough information so that
    further <tt>defstruct</tt> definitions can include (with the <tt>:include</tt>
    option) a structure type defined
    earlier in the file being compiled.  The functions that <tt>defstruct</tt>
    generates are not defined in the compile-time environment, although
    the compiler may save enough information about the functions to allow
    <tt>inline</tt> expansion of
    subsequent calls to these functions.  The <tt>#S</tt> reader syntax may or may not be 
    available for that structure type at compile time.
<P>
<DT><tt>define-condition</tt>
<DD>
The rules are essentially the same as those for
    <tt>defstruct</tt>. The compiler must make the condition type recognizable as a
    valid type name, and it must be possible to reference the condition
    type as the <i>parent-type</i> of another condition type in a subsequent
    <tt>define-condition</tt> form in the file being compiled.
<P>
<DT><tt>defpackage</tt>
<DD>
 All of the actions normally performed by the <tt>defpackage</tt> macro at load
    time must also be performed at compile time.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
Compile-time side effects may cause information about a
    definition to be stored in a different manner from
information about definitions
    processed either interpretively or by loading
    a compiled file.
    In particular, the information stored by a defining macro at
    compile time may or may not be available to the interpreter (either
    during or after compilation) or during subsequent calls to <tt>compile</tt> or
    <tt>compile-file</tt>.  For example, the following code is not portable because
    it assumes that the compiler stores the macro definition of <tt>foo</tt> where
    it is available to the interpreter.
<P><pre>
(defmacro foo (x) `(car ,x)) 

(eval-when (:execute :compile-toplevel :load-toplevel) 
  (print (foo '(a b c))))     ;Wrong
</pre><P>
    The goal may be accomplished portably by including the macro
    definition within the <tt>eval-when</tt> form:
<P><pre>
(eval-when (eval compile load) 
  (defmacro foo (x) `(car ,x)) 
  (print (foo '(a b c))))     ;Right
</pre><P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>declaim</tt>
<DD>
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PROCLAIM-ETC-IN-COMPILE-FILE) <A NAME=28701>&#160;</A> 
to add a new macro <tt>declaim</tt> for making proclamations recognizable
at compile time.  The declaration specifiers in the <tt>declaim</tt> form
are effectively proclaimed at compile time so as to affect
compilation of subsequent forms.  (Note that compiler processing
of a call to <tt>proclaim</tt>
does not have any compile-time side effects, for <tt>proclaim</tt>
is a function.)
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>in-package</tt>
<DD>
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY) <A NAME=28709>&#160;</A>  to specify that
all of the actions normally performed by the <tt>in-package</tt> macro at load
time must also be performed at compile time.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
X3J13 voted in June 1989 (CLOS-MACRO-COMPILATION) <A NAME=28712>&#160;</A> 
to specify the compile-time side effects of processing various CLOS-related
macro forms.  Top-level calls to the CLOS defining macros have the
 following compile-time side effects; any other compile-time behavior
 is explicitly left unspecified.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><tt>defclass</tt>
<DD>
The class name may appear in subsequent type declarations and
can be used as a specializer in subsequent <tt>defmethod</tt> forms.
Thus the compile-time behavior of <tt>defclass</tt> is similar to that of
<tt>deftype</tt> or <tt>defstruct</tt>.
<P>
<DT><tt>defgeneric</tt>
<DD>
The generic function can be referenced in subsequent <tt>defmethod</tt> forms,
but the compiler does not arrange for the generic function to be callable
    at compile time.
<P>
<DT><tt>defmethod</tt>
<DD>  
The compiler does not arrange for the method to be callable at compile
    time.  If there is a generic function with the same name defined at
    compile time, compiling a <tt>defmethod</tt> form does not add the method to that 
    generic function; the method is added to the generic
    function only when the <tt>defmethod</tt> form is actually executed.
<P>
    The error-signaling behavior described in the specification of
    <tt>defmethod</tt> in chapter <A HREF="node260.html#CLOS">28</A> (if the function isn't a generic function
    or if the lambda-list is not congruent) occurs only when the defining
    form is executed, not at compile time.
<P>
    The forms in <tt>eql</tt> parameter specializers are evaluated when the <tt>defmethod</tt>
    form is executed.  The compiler is permitted to build in knowledge
    about what the form in an <tt>eql</tt> specializer will evaluate to in cases
    where the ultimate result can be syntactically inferred without
    actually evaluating it.
<P>
<DT><tt>define-method-combination</tt>
<DD>
The method combination can be used in subsequent <tt>defgeneric</tt> forms.
<P>
    The body of a <tt>define-method-combination</tt> form is evaluated no earlier 
    than when the defining macro is executed and possibly as late as 
    generic function invocation time.  The compiler may attempt to
    evaluate these forms at compile time but must not depend on being able
    to do so.
