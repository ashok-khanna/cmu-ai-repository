In this section, we introduce changes to the terminology
defined in section <A HREF="node11.html#INTROERRORS">1.2.4</A>.
<P>
A <i>condition</i> is an interesting situation in a program that has been
detected and announced. Later we allow this term also to refer to
objects that programs use to represent such situations.
<P>
An <i>error</i> is a condition in which normal program execution may not
continue without some form of intervention (either interactively by the user
or under some sort of program control, as described below).
<P>
The process by which a condition is formally announced by a program is called
<i>signaling</i>. The function <tt>signal</tt> is the primitive mechanism by which such
announcement is done. Other abstractions, such as <tt>error</tt> and <tt>cerror</tt>, are built
using <tt>signal</tt>.
<P>
The first edition is ambiguous about the reason why a particular program action
``is an error.'' There are two principal reasons why an action may be an error
without being required to signal an error:
<UL><LI> Detecting the error might be prohibitively expensive.
<P>
   For example, <tt>(+ nil 3)</tt> is an error. It is likely that the designers of
   Common Lisp believed this would be an error in all implementations but
   felt it might be excessively expensive to detect the problem
   in compiled code on stock hardware, so they did not require that it signal
   an error.
<P>
<LI> Some implementations might implement the behavior as an extension.
<P>
   For example, <tt>(loop for x from 1 to 3 do (print x))</tt> is an error because <tt>loop</tt>
   is not defined to take atoms in its body.
   In fact, however, some
   implementations offer an extension that makes this well-defined. In order
   to leave room for such extensions, the first edition used the ``is an error''
   terminology to keep implementors from being forced to signal an error in
   the extended implementations.
<P>
   [This example was written well before the vote by X3J13 in January 1989
    to add exactly this extension to the forthcoming draft standard
    (see chapter <A HREF="node235.html#LOOP">26</A>).-GLS]
</UL>
<P>
In this chapter, we use the following terminology.
[Compare this to the terminology presented
in section <A HREF="node262.html#ErrorTerminologySECTION">28.1.1</A>.-GLS]
<UL><LI>
   If the signaling of a condition or error is part of a function's contract
   in all situations, we say that it ``signals'' or ``must signal'' that
   condition or error.
<P>
<LI>
   If the signaling of a condition or error is optional for some important
   reason (such as performance), we say that the program ``might signal''
   that condition or error. In this case, we are defining the operation to be
   illegal in all implementations, but allowing some implementations to fail to
   detect the error.
<P>
<LI>
   If an action is left undefined for the sake of implementation-dependent
   extension, we say that it ``is undefined'' or ``has undefined effect.''
   This means that it is not possible to depend portably upon the effects of
   that action. A program that has undefined effect may enter the debugger,
   transfer control, or modify data in unpredictable ways.
<P>
<LI>
   In the special case where only the return value of an operation is not
   well defined but any side effect and transfer-of-control behavior is
   well defined, we say that it has ``undefined value.'' In this case,
   the number and nature of the return values is not defined, but the
   function can reasonably be expected to return. It is worth noting that
   under this description, there are some (though not many) legitimate ways
   in which such return value(s) can be used. For example, if the function
   <tt>foo</tt> has no side effects and undefined value, the expression 
   <tt>(length (list (foo)))</tt> is completely well defined even for portable code.
   However, the effect of <tt>(print (list (foo)))</tt> is not well defined.
