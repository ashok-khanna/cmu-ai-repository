Series combine aspects of sequences, streams, and loops.  Like sequences,
series represent totally ordered multi-sets.  In addition, the series
functions have the same flavor as the sequence functions-namely, they
operate on whole series, rather than extracting elements to be
processed by other functions.  For instance, the series expression below
computes the sum of the positive elements in a list.
<P><pre>
(collect-sum (choose-if #'plusp (scan '(1 -2 3 -4)))) => 4
</pre><P>
<P>
Like streams, series can represent unbounded sets of elements and are
supported by lazy evaluation: each element of a series is not
computed until it is needed.  For instance, the series expression below
returns a list of the first five even natural numbers and their sum.  The
call on <tt>scan-range</tt> returns a series of all the even natural numbers.
However, since no elements beyond the first five are ever used, no elements
beyond the first five are ever computed.
<P><pre>
(let ((x (subseries (scan-range :from 0 :by 2) 0 5))) 
  (values (collect x) (collect-sum x))) 
  => (0 2 4 6 8) and 20
</pre><P>
<P>
Like sequences and unlike streams, a series is not altered
when its elements are accessed.  For instance, both users of <tt>x</tt>
above receive the same elements.
<P>
A totally ordered multi-set of elements can be represented in a loop by the
successive values of a variable.  This is extremely efficient, because it
avoids the need to store the elements as a group in any kind of data
structure.  In most situations, series expressions achieve this same high
level of efficiency, because they are automatically transformed into loops
before being evaluated or compiled.  For instance, the first expression
above is transformed into a loop like the following.
<P><pre>
(let ((sum 0)) 
  (dolist (i '(1 -2  3 -4) sum) 
    (when (plusp i) (setq sum (+ sum i))))) => 4
</pre><P>
<P>
A wide variety of algorithms can be expressed clearly and succinctly with
series expressions.  In particular, at least 90 percent of the loops
programmers typically write can be replaced by series expressions that are
much easier to understand and modify, and just as efficient.   From this
perspective, the key feature of series is that they are supported by a rich
set of functions.  These functions more or less correspond to the union of
the operations provided by the sequence functions, the <tt>loop</tt> clauses,
and the vector operations of APL.
<P>
Some series expressions cannot be transformed into loops.
This is unfortunate, because while transformable series expressions are much more
efficient than equivalent expressions involving sequences or streams,
non-transformable series expressions are much less efficient.  Whenever a
problem comes up that blocks the transformation of a series expression, a
warning message is issued.  On the basis of information in the message, it is
usually easy to provide an efficient fix for the problem (see
section <A HREF="node356.html#SERIESESECTION">A.3</A>).
<P>
Fortunately, most series expressions can be transformed into loops.  In
particular, pure expressions (ones that do not store series in variables)
can always be transformed.  As a result, the best approach for programmers
to take is simply to write series expressions without worrying about
transformability.  When problems come up, they can be ignored (since they
cannot lead to the computation of incorrect results) or dealt with on an
individual basis.

<b>Implementation note:</b> The series functions and the theory
underlying them are described in greater detail
in [<A HREF="node368.html#WATERSSERIESDESIGN">52</A>,<A HREF="node368.html#WATERSSERIESIMPLEMENTATION">53</A>].
These reports also discuss the algorithms required to transform series
expressions into loops and explain how to obtain a portable implementation.
