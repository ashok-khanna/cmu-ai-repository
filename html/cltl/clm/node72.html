<P>
If a data type is viewed as the set of all objects belonging to the type,
then the <tt>typep</tt> function is a set membership test, while <tt>subtypep</tt>
is a subset test.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>typep</tt> <tt><i>object</i></tt> <tt><i>type</i></tt><P>
<tt>typep</tt> is a predicate that
is true if <i>object</i> is of type <i>type</i>, and is false otherwise.
Note that an object can be ``of'' more than one type, since one type can
include another.  The <i>type</i> may be any of the type specifiers
mentioned in chapter <A HREF="node44.html#DTSPEC">4</A> <i>except</i> that it may not
be or contain a type specifier list whose first element is <tt>function</tt>
or <tt>values</tt>.
A specifier of the form <tt>(satisfies <i>fn</i>)</tt> is handled simply
by applying the function <i>fn</i> to <i>object</i>
(see <tt>funcall</tt>); the <i>object</i> is considered
to be of the specified type if the result is not <tt>nil</tt>.

to change <tt>typep</tt> to give specialized
<tt>array</tt> and <tt>complex</tt> type specifiers the same meaning for
purposes of type discrimination as they have for declaration purposes.
Of course, this also applies to such type specifiers as <tt>vector</tt>
and <tt>simple-array</tt>
(see section <A HREF="node49.html#SPECIALIZEDTYPESPECIFIERSECTION">4.5</A>).
Thus
<P><pre>
(typep foo '(array bignum))
</pre><P>
in the first edition asked the question, Is <tt>foo</tt> an array
specialized to hold bignums? but under the new interpretation
asks the question, Could the array <tt>foo</tt> have resulted from
giving <tt>bignum</tt> as the <tt>:element-type</tt> argument
to <tt>make-array</tt>?

<tt>subtypep</tt> <tt><i>type1</i></tt> <tt><i>type2</i></tt><P>
The arguments must be type specifiers that are acceptable to <tt>typep</tt>.
The two type specifiers are compared; this predicate is true
if <i>type1</i> is definitely a (not necessarily proper) subtype of <i>type2</i>.
If the result is <tt>nil</tt>, however, then <i>type1</i> may or may not be a subtype of
<i>type2</i> (sometimes it is impossible to tell, especially when
<tt>satisfies</tt> type specifiers are involved).
A second returned value indicates the certainty of the result;
if it is true, then the first value is an accurate indication
of the subtype relationship.  Thus there are three possible
result combinations:
<PRE><TT> 
<tt>t</tt>    <tt>t</tt>    <i>type1</i> is definitely a subtype of <i>type2</i>
<tt>nil</tt>  <tt>t</tt>    <i>type1</i> is definitely not a subtype of <i>type2</i>
<tt>nil</tt>  <tt>nil</tt>  <tt>subtypep</tt> could not determine the relationship

X3J13 voted in January 1989
(SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE) <A NAME=4014>&#160;</A> 
to place certain requirements upon the implementation of <tt>subtypep</tt>,
for it noted that implementations in many cases simply ``give up''
and return the two values <tt>nil</tt> and <tt>nil</tt> when in fact it would have been
possible to determine the relationship between the given types.
The requirements are as follows, where it is understood that a type specifier <i>s</i>
<i>involves</i> a type specifier <i>u</i> if either <i>s</i> contains an occurrence of <i>u</i>
directly or <i>s</i> contains a type specifier <i>w</i> defined by <tt>deftype</tt> whose
expansion involves <i>u</i>.
<UL><LI> <tt>subtypep</tt> is not permitted to return a second value of <tt>nil</tt>
unless one or both of its arguments involves <tt>satisfies</tt>,
<tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>, or <tt>member</tt>.<p>
<LI> <tt>subtypep</tt> should signal an error when one or both of its arguments
involves <tt>values</tt> or the list form of the <tt>function</tt> type specifier.<p>
<LI> <tt>subtypep</tt> must always return the two values <tt>t</tt> and <tt>t</tt>
in the case where its arguments, after expansion of specifiers
defined by <tt>deftype</tt>, are <tt>equal</tt>.
</UL>
In addition, X3J13 voted to clarify that in some cases
the relationships between types
as reflected by <tt>subtypep</tt> may be implementation-specific.
For example, in an implementation supporting only one type of
floating-point number, <tt>(subtypep 'float 'long-float)</tt> would return
<tt>t</tt> and <tt>t</tt>, since the two types would be identical.
<P>
Note that <tt>satisfies</tt> is an exception because relationships between
types involving <tt>satisfies</tt> are undecidable in general, but (as X3J13 noted)
<tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>, and <tt>member</tt> are merely very messy to deal
with.  In all likelihood these will not be addressed unless and
until someone is willing to write a careful specification that covers
all the cases for the processing of these type
specifiers by <tt>subtypep</tt>.  The requirements stated above were easy
to state and probably suffice for most cases of interest.

<tt>array</tt> and <tt>complex</tt> type specifiers the same meaning for
purposes of type discrimination as they have for declaration purposes.
Of course, this also applies to such type specifiers as <tt>vector</tt>

(see section <A HREF="node49.html#SPECIALIZEDTYPESPECIFIERSECTION">4.5</A>).
<P>
If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are type specifiers (other than <tt>*</tt>, which technically
is not a type specifier anyway), then <tt>(array <i>A</i>)</tt>
and <tt>(array <i>B</i>)</tt> represent the same type in a given implementation
if and only if they denote arrays
of the same specialized representation in that implementation;
otherwise they are disjoint.
To put it another way, they represent the same type

if and only if
<tt>(upgraded-array-element-type '<i>A</i>)</tt> and
<tt>(upgraded-array-element-type '<i>B</i>)</tt> are the same type.
Therefore
<P><pre>
(subtypep '(array <i>A</i>) '(array <i>B</i>))
</pre><P>
is true if and only if
<tt>(upgraded-array-element-type '<i>A</i>)</tt>
is the same type as
<tt>(upgraded-array-element-type '<i>B</i>)</tt>.
<P>
The <tt>complex</tt> type specifier is treated in a similar but subtly different
manner.
If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are two type specifiers (but not <tt>*</tt>, which technically
is not a type specifier anyway), then <tt>(complex <i>A</i>)</tt>
and <tt>(complex <i>B</i>)</tt> represent the same type in a given implementation
if and only if they refer to complex numbers
of the same specialized representation in that implementation;
otherwise they are disjoint.
Note, however, that there is no function called <tt>make-complex</tt> that
allows one to specify a particular element type (then to be upgraded);
instead, one must describe specialized complex numbers in terms of
the actual types of the parts from which they were constructed.
There is no number of type (or rather, <i>representation</i>)
<tt>float</tt> as such; there are only numbers of type <tt>single-float</tt>,
numbers of type <tt>double-float</tt>,
and so on.  Therefore we want <tt>(complex single-float)</tt> to
be a subtype of <tt>(complex float)</tt>.
<P>
The rule, then, is that <tt>(complex <i>A</i>)</tt>
and <tt>(complex <i>B</i>)</tt> represent the same type (and otherwise are disjoint)
in a given implementation
if and only if <i>either</i> the type <i>A</i> is a subtype of <i>B</i>, <i>or</i>
<tt>(upgraded-complex-part-type '<i>A</i>)</tt> and
<tt>(upgraded-complex-part-type '<i>B</i>)</tt> are the same type.
In the latter case <tt>(complex <i>A</i>)</tt>
and <tt>(complex <i>B</i>)</tt> in fact refer to the same specialized representation.
Therefore
<P><pre>
(subtypep '(complex <i>A</i>) '(complex <i>B</i>))
</pre><P>
is true if and only if the results of
<tt>(upgraded-complex-part-type '<i>A</i>)</tt> and
<tt>(upgraded-complex-part-type '<i>B</i>)</tt> are the same type.
<P>
Under this interpretation
<P><pre>
(subtypep '(complex single-float) '(complex float))
</pre><P>
must be true in all implementations; but
<P><pre>
(subtypep '(array single-float) '(array float))
</pre><P>
is true only in implementations that do not have a specialized array representation
for <tt>single-float</tt> elements distinct from that for <tt>float</tt> elements in
general.
