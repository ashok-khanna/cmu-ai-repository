X3J13 voted in March 1988
(PATHNAME-SYMBOL) <A NAME=26748>&#160;</A> 
to change the language so that a symbol is
<i>never</i> allowed as a pathname argument.  More specifically, the
following functions are changed to disallow a symbol as a <i>pathname</i>
argument:
<pre>
pathname          pathname-device     namestring 
truename          pathname-directory  file-namestring 
parse-namestring  pathname-name       directory-namestring 
merge-pathnames   pathname-type       host-namestring 
pathname-host     pathname-version    enough-namestring
</pre>
(The function <tt>require</tt> was
also changed by this vote but was
deleted from the language by a vote in January 1989
(REQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS) <A NAME=26774>&#160;</A> .)
Furthermore, the vote reaffirmed that the following functions
do not accept symbols as <i>file</i>, <i>filename</i>, or <i>pathname</i> arguments:
<pre>
open             rename-file     file-write-date 
with-open-file   delete-file     file-author 
load             probe-file      directory 
compile-file
</pre>
In older implementations of Lisp that did not have strings, for example
MacLisp, symbols were the only means for specifying pathnames.
This was convenient only because the file systems of the time allowed
only uppercase letters in file names.  Typing <tt>(load 'foo)</tt> caused
the function <tt>load</tt> to receive the symbol <tt>FOO</tt> (with uppercase
letters because of the way symbols are parsed) and therefore to
load the file named <tt>FOO</tt>.
Now that many file systems, most notably UNIX, support
case-sensitive file names, the use of symbols is less convenient
and more error-prone.
<P>
X3J13 voted in March 1988
(PATHNAME-STREAM) <A NAME=26802>&#160;</A> 
to specify that a stream may be used
as a <tt>pathname</tt>, <tt>file</tt>, or <tt>filename</tt> argument
only if it was created by use of <tt>open</tt> or <tt>with-open-file</tt>,
or if it is a synonym stream whose symbol is bound to a stream that
may be used as a pathname.
<P>
If such a stream is used as a pathname, it is as if the <tt>pathname</tt> function
were applied to the stream and the resulting pathname used in place of the
stream.  This represents the name used to open the file.
This may be, but is not required to be, the actual name of the file.
<P>
It is an error to attempt to obtain a pathname
from a stream created by any of the following:
<pre>
make-two-way-stream              make-string-input-stream 
make-echo-stream                 make-string-output-stream 
make-broadcast-stream            with-input-from-string 
make-concatenated-stream         with-output-to-string
</pre>
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
In the examples, it is assumed that the host named <tt>CMUC</tt> runs
the TOPS-20 operating system, and therefore uses TOPS-20
file system syntax; furthermore, an explicit host name is
indicated by following the host name with a double colon.
Remember, however, that namestring syntax is implementation-dependent,
and this syntax is used here purely for the sake of examples.

X3J13 further commented that because some implementations cannot
provide the ``true name'' of a file until the file is closed,
in such an implementation <tt>pathname</tt> might, in principle,
return a different (perhaps more specific) file name after the stream is closed.
However, such behavior is prohibited; <tt>pathname</tt> must return the
same pathname after a stream is closed as it would have while the stream
was open.  See <tt>truename</tt>.

The ``true name'' is returned as a pathname.

<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
This function does <i>not</i>, in general, do defaulting of pathname components,
even though it has an argument named <i>defaults</i>;
it only does parsing.  The
<i>host</i> and <i>defaults</i> arguments are present because in some implementations
it may be that a namestring can only be parsed with reference to a
particular file name syntax of several available in the implementation.
If <i>host</i> is
non-<tt>nil</tt>, it must be a host name that could appear in the
host component of a pathname, or <tt>nil</tt>;
if <i>host</i> is <tt>nil</tt> then the host 
name is extracted from the default pathname in <i>defaults</i>
and used to determine the syntax convention.  The <i>defaults</i> argument
defaults to the value of <tt>*default-pathname-defaults*</tt>.
<P>
For a string (or symbol) argument, <tt>parse-namestring</tt>
parses a file name within it in the
range delimited by the <tt>:start</tt> and <tt>:end</tt> arguments
(which are integer indices
into <i>string</i>, defaulting to the beginning and end of the string).

<P>
If <tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is not <tt>nil</tt>, then the first value
returned is the pathname parsed, or <tt>nil</tt> if no syntactically correct
pathname was seen.
<P>
If <tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is <tt>nil</tt> (the default),
then the entire substring is scanned.
The returned value is the pathname parsed.
An error is signaled if the substring does not consist entirely of
the representation of a pathname, possibly surrounded on either side by
whitespace characters if that is appropriate to the cultural conventions
of the implementation.
<P>
In either case, the second value is the index into the string of the delimiter
that terminated the parse, or the index beyond the substring if the
parse terminated at the end of the substring (as will always be the case if
<tt>:junk-allowed</tt> is false).
<P>
If <i>thing</i> is not a string or symbol, then <i>start</i> (which defaults
to zero in any case) is always returned as the second value.
<P>
Parsing an empty string always succeeds, producing a pathname with
all components (except the host) equal to <tt>nil</tt>.
<P>
Note that if <i>host</i> is specified and not <tt>nil</tt>,
and <i>thing</i> contains a manifest host name, an
error is signaled if the hosts do not match.
<P>
If <i>thing</i> contains an explicit host name and no explicit device name,
then it might be appropriate, depending on the

standard default device for that host as the device component

      &quot;CMUC::PS:&lt;LISPIO&gt;FORMAT.FASL.0&quot;
</pre><P>
<P>
Defaulting of pathname components is done by filling in components taken
from another pathname.
This is especially useful for
cases such as a program that has an input file and an output file, and
asks the user for the name of both, letting the unsupplied components of
one name default from the other.  Unspecified components of the output
pathname will come from the input pathname, except that the type should
default not to the type of the input but to the appropriate default type
for output from this program.
<P>
The pathname merging operation takes as input a given pathname, a
defaults pathname, and a default version, and returns a
new pathname.  Basically, the missing components in the given pathname
are filled in from the defaults pathname, except that
if no version is specified the
default version is used.
The default version is usually <tt>:newest</tt>; if no version is specified
the newest version in existence should be used.  The default
version can be <tt>nil</tt>, to preserve the information that it was missing
in the input pathname.
<P>
If the
given pathname explicitly specifies a host and does not supply a device, then
if the host component of the defaults matches the host component
of the given pathname, then the device is taken from the defaults;
otherwise
the device will be the default file device for that host.  Next, if
the
given pathname does not specify a host, device, directory, name,
or type, each such
component is copied from the defaults.
The merging rules for the version are more complicated and
depend on whether the pathname specifies a name.  If the pathname
doesn't specify a name, then the version, if not provided, will
come from the defaults, just like the other components.  However, if the
pathname does specify a name, then the version is not affected
by the defaults.  The reason is that the version
``belongs to'' some other file name and is unlikely to have anything to do
with the new one.  Finally, if this process leaves the
version missing, the default version is used.
<P>
The net effect is that if the user supplies just a name, then the
host, device, directory, and type will come from the defaults, but the
version will come from the default version
argument to the merging operation.  If the user supplies nothing, or
just a directory, the name, type, and version will come over from
the defaults together.  If the host's file name syntax provides a way
to input a version without a name or type, the user can let the name
and type
default but supply a version different from the one in the defaults.

X3J13 voted in June 1989 (PATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME) <A NAME=26967>&#160;</A>  to agree to disagree:
<tt>merge-pathname</tt> might or might not perform plausibility checking
on its arguments to ensure that the resulting pathname can be converted
a valid namestring.  User beware: this could cause portability problems.
<P>
For example, suppose that host <tt>LOSER</tt> constrains file types to be three characters
or fewer but host <tt>CMUC</tt> does not.  Then <tt>&quot;LOSER::FORMAT&quot;</tt> is a valid
namestring and <tt>&quot;CMUC::PS:&lt;LISPIO&gt;.FASL&quot;</tt> is a valid namestring, but

equivalent to the namestring <tt>&quot;LOSER::FORMAT.FASL&quot;</tt> which is illegal
because the file type <tt>FASL</tt> has more than three characters.

the merging rules used by <tt>merge-pathnames</tt> are used to fill
in any missing components from the defaults specified by the

<tt>namestring</tt> returns the full form of the <i>pathname</i> as a string.
<tt>file-namestring</tt> returns a string representing just the <i>name</i>,
<i>type</i>, and <i>version</i> components of the <i>pathname</i>;
the result of <tt>directory-namestring</tt>
represents just the <i>directory-name</i> portion; and <tt>host-namestring</tt>
returns a string for just the <i>host-name</i> portion.
Note that a valid namestring cannot necessarily be constructed
simply by concatenating some of the three shorter strings in some order.
<P>
<tt>enough-namestring</tt> takes another argument, <i>defaults</i>.
It returns an abbreviated namestring that is just sufficient to
identify the file named by <i>pathname</i> when considered relative
to the <i>defaults</i> (which defaults to the value of
<tt>*default-pathname-defaults*</tt>).  That is, it is required
that
<P><pre>
(merge-pathnames (enough-namestring <i>pathname</i> <i>defaults</i>) <i>defaults</i>) == 
 (merge-pathnames (parse-namestring <i>pathname</i> nil <i>defaults</i>) <i>defaults</i>)
</pre><P>
in all cases; and the result of <tt>enough-namestring</tt> is, roughly speaking,
the shortest reasonable string that will still satisfy this criterion.

<tt>user-homedir-pathname &amp;optional <i>host</i></tt><P>Returns a pathname for the user's ``home directory'' on <i>host</i>.
The <i>host</i> argument
defaults in some appropriate implementation-dependent manner.  The
concept of ``home directory'' is itself somewhat
implementation-dependent, but from the point of view of Common Lisp it is the
directory where the user keeps personal files such as initialization
files and mail.  If it is impossible to determine this information,
then <tt>nil</tt> is returned instead of a pathname; however,
<tt>user-homedir-pathname</tt> never returns <tt>nil</tt> if the <i>host</i> argument
is not specified.
This function returns a pathname without any name, type,
or version component (those components are all <tt>nil</tt>).
