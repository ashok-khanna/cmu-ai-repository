<A NAME=7948>provides</A>
<A NAME=7949>a</A>
<A NAME=7950>facility</A>
for exiting from a complex process
in a non-local, dynamically scoped manner.  There are two classes of
special forms for this purpose, called <i>catch</i> forms and <i>throw</i>
forms, or simply <i>catches</i> and <i>throws</i>.  A catch form evaluates some
subforms in such a way that, if a throw form is executed during such
evaluation, the evaluation is aborted at that point and the catch form
immediately returns a value specified by the throw.  Unlike <tt>block</tt>
and <tt>return</tt> (section <A HREF="node85.html#BLOCKRETURNSECTION">7.7</A>),
which allow for exiting a <tt>block</tt> form from any
point lexically within the body of the <tt>block</tt>, the catch/throw
mechanism works even if the throw form is not textually within the body
of the catch form.  The throw need only occur within the extent (time
span) of the evaluation of the body of the catch.  This is analogous to
the distinction between dynamically bound (special) variables and
lexically bound (local) variables.
<P>
<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>catch</tt> <tt><i>tag</i></tt> <tt>{<i>form</i>}*</tt><P>The <tt>catch</tt> special form serves as a target for transfer
of control by <tt>throw</tt>.
The form <i>tag</i> is evaluated first to produce an object
that names the catch; it may be any Lisp object.
A catcher is then established with the object as the tag.
The <i>form</i>s are evaluated as an implicit <tt>progn</tt>,
and the results of the last form are returned,
except that if during the evaluation of the <i>form</i>s
a throw should be executed such that the tag
of the throw matches (is <tt>eq</tt> to) the tag of the <tt>catch</tt>
and the catcher is the most recent outstanding catcher with that tag,
then the evaluation of the <i>form</i>s is aborted and the results
specified by the throw
are immediately returned from the <tt>catch</tt> expression.
The catcher established by the <tt>catch</tt> expression is disestablished
just before the results are returned.
<P>
The tag is used to match throws with catches.
<tt>(catch 'foo <i>form</i>)</tt> will catch a <tt>(throw 'foo <i>form</i>)</tt> but
not a <tt>(throw 'bar <i>form</i>)</tt>.  It is an error if <tt>throw</tt> is done
when there is no suitable <tt>catch</tt> ready to catch it.
<P>
Catch tags are compared using <tt>eq</tt>,
not <tt>eql</tt>; therefore numbers and characters
should not be used as catch tags.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> The name <tt>catch</tt> comes from MacLisp,
but the syntax of <tt>catch</tt> in Common Lisp is different.
The MacLisp syntax was <tt>(catch <i>form</i> <i>tag</i>)</tt>,
where the <i>tag</i> was not evaluated.

<BR><b>[Special Form]</b><BR>
<tt>unwind-protect</tt> <tt><i>protected-form</i></tt> <tt>{<i>cleanup-form</i>}*</tt><P>Sometimes it is necessary to evaluate a form and make sure that
certain side effects take place after the form is evaluated;
a typical example is
<P><pre>
(progn (start-motor) 
       (drill-hole) 
       (stop-motor))
</pre><P>
The non-local exit facility of Common Lisp creates a situation in which
the above code won't work, however: if <tt>drill-hole</tt> should
do a throw to a catch that is outside of the <tt>progn</tt>
form (perhaps because the drill bit broke),
then <tt>(stop-motor)</tt> will never be evaluated
(and the motor will presumably be left running).
This is particularly likely if <tt>drill-hole</tt> causes a Lisp error
and the user tells the error-handler to give up and abort
the computation.
(A possibly more practical example might be
<P><pre>
(prog2 (open-a-file) 
       (process-file) 
       (close-the-file))
</pre><P>
where it is desired always to close the file when the computation
is terminated for whatever reason.  This case is so important
that Common Lisp provides the special form <tt>with-open-file</tt> for
this purpose.)
<P>
In order to allow the example hole-drilling program to work, it can
be rewritten using <tt>unwind-protect</tt> as follows:
<P><pre>
;; Stop the motor no matter what (even if it failed to start). 

(unwind-protect 
  (progn (start-motor) 
         (drill-hole)) 
  (stop-motor))
</pre><P>
If <tt>drill-hole</tt> does a throw that attempts to quit out of the
<tt>unwind-protect</tt>, then <tt>(stop-motor)</tt> will be executed.
<P>
This example assumes that it is correct to call <tt>stop-motor</tt>
even if the motor has not yet been started.  Remember that
an error or interrupt may cause an exit even before any initialization
forms have been executed.  Any state restoration code
should operate correctly no matter where in the protected code an
exit occurred.  For example, the following code
is not correct:
<P><pre>
(unwind-protect 
  (progn (incf *access-count*) 
         (perform-access)) 
  (decf *access-count*))
</pre><P>
If an exit occurs before completion of the <tt>incf</tt> operation
the <tt>decf</tt> operation will be executed anyway, resulting in an
incorrect value for <tt>*access-count*</tt>.
The correct way to code this is as follows:
<P><pre>
(let ((old-count *access-count*)) 
  (unwind-protect 
    (progn (incf *access-count*) 
           (perform-access)) 
    (setq *access-count* old-count)))
</pre><P>
<P>
As a general rule, <tt>unwind-protect</tt> guarantees to execute
the <i>cleanup-form</i>s before exiting, whether it terminates
normally or is aborted by a throw of some kind.
(If, however, an exit occurs during execution of the <i>cleanup-form</i>s,
no special action is taken.  The <i>cleanup-form</i>s of an <tt>unwind-protect</tt>
are not protected by that <tt>unwind-protect</tt>, though they may be
protected if that <tt>unwind-protect</tt> occurs within the protected
form of another <tt>unwind-protect</tt>.)
<tt>unwind-protect</tt> returns whatever results from evaluation of
the <i>protected-form</i> and discards all the results
from the <i>cleanup-form</i>s.
<P>
It should be emphasized that <tt>unwind-protect</tt> protects against
<i>all</i> attempts to exit from the protected form,
including not only ``dynamic exit'' facilities such as <tt>throw</tt>
but also ``lexical exit'' facilities such as <tt>go</tt> and
<tt>return-from</tt>.  Consider this situation:
<P><pre>
(tagbody 
  (let ((x 3)) 
    (unwind-protect 
      (if (numberp x) (go out)) 
      (print x))) 
 out 
  ...)
</pre><P>
When the <tt>go</tt> is executed, the call to <tt>print</tt> is executed first,
and then the transfer of control to the tag <tt>out</tt> is completed.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
X3J13 voted in March 1989 (EXIT-EXTENT) <A NAME=8037>&#160;</A>  to clarify the interaction
of <tt>unwind-protect</tt> with constructs that perform exits.
<P>
Let an <i>exit</i> be a point out of which control can be transferred.
For a <tt>throw</tt> the exit is the matching <tt>catch</tt>; for
a <tt>return-from</tt> the exit is the corresponding <tt>block</tt>.
For a <tt>go</tt> the exit is the statement within the <tt>tagbody</tt> (the one to which
the target tag belongs) which is being executed at the time the <tt>go</tt> is performed.
<P>
The extent of an exit is dynamic; it is not indefinite. The extent
of an exit begins when the corresponding form (<tt>catch</tt>, <tt>block</tt>, or <tt>tagbody</tt>
statement) is entered.  When the extent of an exit has ended, it is no
longer legal to return from it.
<P>
Note that the extent of an exit is not the same thing as the scope or extent of the
designator by which the exit is identified. For example, a <tt>block</tt>
name has lexical scope but the extent of its exit is dynamic.  The
extent of a <tt>catch</tt> tag could differ from the extent of the exit
associated with the <tt>catch</tt> (which is exactly what is at issue here).
The difference matters when there are transfers
of control from the cleanup clauses of an <tt>unwind-protect</tt>.
<P>
When a transfer of control out of an exit is initiated by <tt>throw</tt>,
<tt>return-from</tt>, or <tt>go</tt>,
a variety of events occur before the transfer of control is complete:
<UL><LI> The cleanup clauses of any intervening <tt>unwind-protect</tt> clauses
    are evaluated.
<LI> Intervening dynamic bindings of special variables and catch tags
    are undone.
<LI> Intervening exits are <i>abandoned</i>, that is, their extent ends and it
    is no longer legal to attempt to transfer control from them.
<LI> The extent of the exit being invoked ends.
<LI> Control is finally passed to the target.
</UL>
The first edition left the order of these events in some doubt.
The implementation note for <tt>throw</tt> hinted that the first two processes
are interwoven, but it was unclear whether it is permissible
for an implementation to abandon all 
intervening exits before processing any intervening <tt>unwind-protect</tt>
cleanup clauses.
<P>
The clarification adopted by X3J13 is as follows.
Intervening exits are abandoned as soon as the transfer of control is initiated;
in the case of a <tt>throw</tt>, this occurs at the beginning of the ``second pass''
mentioned in the implementation note.  It is an error to
attempt a transfer of control to an exit whose dynamic extent has
ended.
<P>
Next the evaluation of <tt>unwind-protect</tt> cleanup clauses and the
undoing of dynamic bindings and <tt>catch</tt> tags are performed together,
in the order corresponding to the reverse of the order
in which they were established.
The effect of this is that the cleanup clauses of an <tt>unwind-protect</tt>
will see the same dynamic bindings of variables and <tt>catch</tt> tags as were
visible when the <tt>unwind-protect</tt> was entered.  (However, some of those
<tt>catch</tt> tags may not be useable because they correspond to abandoned
exit points.)
<P>
Finally  control is transferred to
the originally invoked exit and simultaneously that exit is abandoned.
<P>
The effect of this specification is that once a program has attempted
to transfer control to a particular exit, an <tt>unwind-protect</tt> cleanup
form cannot
step in and decide to transfer control to a more recent (nested) exit,
blithely forgetting the original exit request.  However, a cleanup form
may restate the request to transfer to the same exit that started
the cleanup process.
<P>
Here is an example based on a nautical metaphor.  The function <tt>gently</tt>
moves an oar in the water with low force, but if an oar gets stuck, the caller
will catch a crab.  The function <tt>row</tt>
takes a boat, an oar-stroking function,
a stream, and a count; an oar is constructed for the boat and stream
and the oar-stroking function is called <tt>:count</tt> times.
The function <tt>life</tt> rows a particular boat.
Merriment follows, except that if the oarsman is winded he must stop
to catch his breath.
<P><pre>
(defun gently (oar) 
  (stroke oar :force 0.5) 
  (when (stuck oar) 
    (throw 'crab nil))) 

(defun row (boat stroke-fn stream &amp;key count) 
  (let ((oar (make-oar boat stream))) 
    (loop repeat count do (funcall stroke-fn oar)))) 

(defun life () 
  (catch 'crab 
    (catch 'breath 
      (unwind-protect 
        (row *your-boat* #'gently *query-io* :count 3)) 
        (when (winded) (throw 'breath nil))) 
      (loop repeat 4 (set-mode :merry)) 
      (dream))))
</pre><P>
Suppose that the oar gets stuck, causing <tt>gently</tt> to call <tt>throw</tt>
with the tag <tt>crab</tt>.
The program is then committed to exiting from the outer <tt>catch</tt> (the one
with the tag <tt>crab</tt>).  As control breaks out of the <tt>unwind-protect</tt> form,
the <tt>winded</tt> test is executed.  Suppose it is true; then another call to <tt>throw</tt>
occurs, this time with the tag <tt>breath</tt>.  The inner <tt>catch</tt> (the one with
the tag <tt>breath</tt>) has been abandoned as a result of the first
<tt>throw</tt> operation (still in progress).  The clarification voted by X3J13
specifies that the program is in error for attempting to transfer control
to an abandoned exit point.  To put it in terms of the example: once you have
begun to catch
a crab, you cannot rely on being able to catch your breath.
<P>
Implementations may support longer extents for exits than is
required by this specification,
but portable programs may not rely on such extended extents.
<P>
(This specification is somewhat controversial.  An alternative proposal was
that the abandoning of exits should be lumped in with
the evaluation of <tt>unwind-protect</tt> cleanup clauses and the
undoing of dynamic bindings and <tt>catch</tt> tags, performing all
in reverse order of establishment.  X3J13 agreed that this approach is
theoretically cleaner and more elegant but also more stringent
and of little additional practical use.  There was some concern that
a more stringent specification might be a great added burden to some
implementors and would achieve only a small gain for users.)

<tt>throw</tt> <tt><i>tag</i></tt> <tt><i>result</i></tt><P>The <tt>throw</tt> special form transfers control to a matching
<tt>catch</tt> construct.
The <i>tag</i> is evaluated first to produce an object
called the throw tag; then the <i>result</i> form is evaluated,
and its results are saved (if the <i>result</i> form produces
multiple values, then <i>all</i> the values are saved).
The most recent outstanding catch whose tag matches the throw tag
is exited; the saved results are returned as the value(s) of the catch.
A <tt>catch</tt> matches only if the catch tag is <tt>eq</tt> to the throw tag.
<P>
In the process, dynamic variable
bindings are undone back to the point of the catch, and any intervening
<tt>unwind-protect</tt> cleanup code is executed.
The <i>result</i> form is evaluated before the unwinding process commences,
and whatever results it produces are returned from the catch.
<P>
If there is no outstanding catcher whose tag matches the throw tag,
no unwinding of the stack is performed, and an error is signalled.
When the error is signalled, the outstanding catchers and the dynamic
variable bindings are those in force at the point of the throw.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> These requirements imply that throwing should typically
make two passes over the control stack.  In the first pass it simply
searches for a matching catch.  In this search every <tt>catch</tt>
must be considered, but every
<tt>unwind-protect</tt> should be ignored.  On the second pass the stack
is actually unwound, one frame at a time, undoing dynamic bindings
and outstanding <tt>unwind-protect</tt> constructs in reverse order of creation
until the matching catch is reached.

<b>Compatibility note:</b> The name <tt>throw</tt> comes from MacLisp,
but the syntax of <tt>throw</tt> in Common Lisp is different.
The MacLisp syntax was <tt>(throw <i>form</i> <i>tag</i>)</tt>,
where the <i>tag</i> was not evaluated.
