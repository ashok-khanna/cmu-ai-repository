<P>
<A NAME=EXPORTIMPORTSECTION>Symbols</A>
from one package may be made accessible in another package in
two ways.
<P>
First, any individual symbol may be added to a package by use
of the function <tt>import</tt>.  The form <tt>(import 'editor:buffer)</tt> takes
the external symbol named <tt>buffer</tt> in the <tt>editor</tt> package (this
symbol was located when the form was read by the Lisp reader) and adds
it to the current package as an internal symbol.  The symbol is then
present in the current package.  The imported symbol is
not automatically exported from the current package, but if it is
already present and external, then the fact that it
is external is not changed.  After the call to
<tt>import</tt> it is possible to refer to <tt>buffer</tt> in the importing package
without any qualifier.  The status of <tt>buffer</tt> in the package named
<tt>editor</tt> is unchanged, and <tt>editor</tt> remains the home package for
this symbol.  Once imported, a symbol is <i>present</i> in the
importing package and can be removed only by calling <tt>unintern</tt>.
<P>
If the symbol is already present in the importing package, <tt>import</tt>
has no effect.  If a distinct symbol with the name <tt>buffer</tt> is
accessible in the importing package (directly or by inheritance), then a
correctable error is signaled, as described in
section <A HREF="node116.html#NAMECONFLICTSSECTION">11.5</A>, because <tt>import</tt> avoids letting
one symbol shadow another.
<P>
A symbol is said to be <i>shadowed</i> by another symbol in
some package if the first symbol would be accessible by inheritance
if not for the presence of the second symbol.
To import a symbol without the possibility
of getting an
error because of shadowing,
use the function <tt>shadowing-import</tt>.  This inserts
the symbol into the specified package as an internal symbol, regardless
of whether another symbol of the same name will be shadowed by this
action.
If a different symbol of the same name is already present
in the package, that symbol will first be uninterned from the package
(see <tt>unintern</tt>).  The new symbol is
added to the package's shadowing-symbols list.  <tt>shadowing-import</tt>
should be used with caution.  It changes the state of the package system
in such a way that the consistency rules do not hold across the change.
<P>
The second mechanism is provided by the function <tt>use-package</tt>.  This
causes a package to inherit all of the external symbols of some other
package.  These symbols become accessible as <i>internal</i> symbols of the
using package.  That is, they can be referred to without a qualifier
while this package is current, but they are not passed along to any
other package that uses this package.  Note that <tt>use-package</tt>,
unlike <tt>import</tt>, does not cause any new symbols to be <i>present</i>
in the current package but only makes them <i>accessible</i> by inheritance.
<tt>use-package</tt> checks carefully for
name conflicts between the newly imported symbols and those already
accessible in the importing package.  This is described in detail in
section <A HREF="node116.html#NAMECONFLICTSSECTION">11.5</A>.
<P>
Typically a user, working by default in the <tt>user</tt> package, will
load a number of packages into Lisp to provide an augmented working
environment, and then call <tt>use-package</tt> on each of these packages
to allow easy access to their external symbols.
<tt>unuse-package</tt> undoes the effects of a previous <tt>use-package</tt>.  The
external symbols of the used package are no longer inherited.  However,
any symbols that have been imported into the using package continue to
be present in that package.
<P>
There is no way to inherit the <i>internal</i> symbols of another package;
to refer to an internal symbol, the user must either make that symbol's home
package current, use a qualifier, or import that symbol into the current
package.
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="change_begin" src="gif/change_begin.gif"><br>
The distinction between
external and internal symbols is a primary means of hiding names
so that one program does not tread on the namespace of another.
<br><img align=bottom alt="change_end" src="gif/change_end.gif">
<P>
When <tt>intern</tt> or some other function wants to look up a symbol in a
given package, it first looks for the symbol among the external and
internal symbols of the package itself; then it looks through the
external symbols of the used packages in some unspecified order.  The
order does not matter; according to the rules for handling name
conflicts (see below), if conflicting symbols appear in two or more
packages inherited by package <i>X</i>, a symbol of this name must also appear
in <i>X</i> itself as a shadowing symbol.  Of course, implementations are free
to choose other, more efficient ways of implementing this search, as
long as the user-visible behavior is equivalent to what is described
here.
<P>
The function <tt>export</tt> takes a symbol that is accessible in some
specified package (directly or by inheritance) and makes it an external
symbol of that package.  If the symbol is already accessible as an
external symbol in the package, <tt>export</tt> has no effect.  If the symbol
is directly present in the package as an internal symbol, it is simply
changed to external status.  If it is accessible as an internal symbol
via <tt>use-package</tt>, the symbol is first imported into the package, then
exported.  (The symbol is then present in the specified package
whether or not the package
continues to use the package through which the symbol was originally
inherited.)  If the symbol is not
accessible at all in the specified package, a correctable error is
signaled that, upon continuing, asks the user whether the symbol
should be imported.
<P>
The function <tt>unexport</tt> is provided mainly as a way to undo erroneous
calls to <tt>export</tt>.  It works only on symbols directly present
in the current package, switching them back to internal status.  If
<tt>unexport</tt> is given a symbol already accessible as an internal
symbol in the current package, it does nothing; if it is given a symbol
not accessible in the package at all, it signals an error.
