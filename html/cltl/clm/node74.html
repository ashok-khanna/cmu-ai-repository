<P>
Common Lisp provides a spectrum of predicates for testing for equality of
two objects: <tt>eq</tt> (the most specific), <tt>eql</tt>, <tt>equal</tt>, and <tt>equalp</tt>
(the most general).  <tt>eq</tt> and <tt>equal</tt> have the meanings traditional
in Lisp.  <tt>eql</tt> was added because it is frequently needed, and
<tt>equalp</tt> was added primarily in order to have a version of <tt>equal</tt>
that would ignore type differences when comparing numbers
and case differences when comparing characters.
If two objects satisfy any one of these equality predicates,
then they also satisfy all those that are more general.
<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>eq</tt> <tt><i>x</i></tt> <tt><i>y</i></tt><P><tt>(eq <i>x</i> <i>y</i>)</tt> is true
if and only if <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the same identical object.
(Implementationally, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are usually
<tt>eq</tt> if and only if they address the same identical memory location.)
<P>
It should be noted that things that print the same are not necessarily <tt>eq</tt>
to each other.  Symbols with the same print name usually are <tt>eq</tt> to
each other because of the use of the <tt>intern</tt> function.
However, numbers with the same value
need not be <tt>eq</tt>, and two similar lists are usually not <tt>eq</tt>.
For example:
<P><pre>
(eq 'a 'b) is false. 
(eq 'a 'a) is true. 
(eq 3 3) might be true or false, depending on the implementation. 
(eq 3 3.0) is false. 
(eq 3.0 3.0) might be true or false, depending on the implementation. 
(eq #c(3 -4) #c(3 -4)) 
  might be true or false, depending on the implementation. 
(eq #c(3 -4.0) #c(3 -4)) is false. 
(eq (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'c)) is false. 
(eq (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b)) is false. 
(eq '(a . b) '(a . b)) might be true or false. 
(progn (setq x (cons 'a 'b)) (eq x x)) is true. 
(progn (setq x '(a . b)) (eq x x)) is true. 
(eq #\A #\A) might be true or false, depending on the implementation. 
(eq &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot;) might be true or false. 
(eq &quot;Foo&quot; (copy-seq &quot;Foo&quot;)) is false. 
(eq &quot;FOO&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) is false.
</pre><P>
In Common Lisp, unlike some other Lisp dialects, the implementation
is permitted to make ``copies'' of
characters and numbers at any time.  (This permission is granted
because it allows tremendous performance improvements in many
common situations.)  The net effect is that
Common Lisp makes no guarantee that <tt>eq</tt> will be true even when both
its arguments are ``the same thing'' if that thing is a character or number.
For example:
<P><pre>
(let ((x 5)) (eq x x)) might be true or false.
</pre><P>
The predicate <tt>eql</tt> is the same as <tt>eq</tt>, except that if the
arguments are characters or numbers of the same type then their
values are compared.  Thus <tt>eql</tt> tells whether two objects
are <i>conceptually</i> the same, whereas <tt>eq</tt> tells whether two
objects are <i>implementationally</i> identical.  It is for this reason
that <tt>eql</tt>, not <tt>eq</tt>, is the default comparison predicate
for the sequence functions defined in chapter <A HREF="node141.html#KSEQUE">14</A>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Implementation note:</b> <tt>eq</tt> simply compares the two given pointers,
so any kind of object that is represented in an ``immediate'' fashion
will indeed have like-valued instances satisfy <tt>eq</tt>.
In some implementations, for example,
fixnums and characters happen to ``work.''
However, no program should depend on this, as other implementations
of Common Lisp might not use an immediate representation for these data types.
<hr>
<P>
<img align=bottom alt="old_change_begin" src="gif/old_change_begin.gif"><br>
An additional problem with <tt>eq</tt> is that the implementation is permitted
to ``collapse'' constants (or portions thereof)
appearing in code to be compiled if they are
<tt>equal</tt>.  An object is considered to be a constant in code to be compiled
if it is a self-evaluating form or is contained in a <tt>quote</tt> form.
This is why <tt>(eq &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot;)</tt> might be true or false; in interpreted
code it would normally be false, because reading in the
form <tt>(eq &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot;)</tt> would construct distinct strings for the two
arguments to <tt>eq</tt>, but the compiler might choose to use the same
identical string or two distinct copies as the two arguments in the
call to <tt>eq</tt>.  Similarly, <tt>(eq '(a . b) '(a . b))</tt> might be true
or false, depending on whether the constant conses appearing in the
<tt>quote</tt> forms were collapsed by the compiler.  However,
<tt>(eq (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b))</tt> is always false, because every distinct
call to the <tt>cons</tt> function necessarily produces a new and distinct cons.

X3J13 voted in March 1989 (QUOTE-SEMANTICS) <A NAME=4374>&#160;</A>  to clarify that
<tt>eval</tt> and <tt>compile</tt> are not permitted either to copy or
to coalesce (``collapse'') constants (see <tt>eq</tt>)
appearing in the code they process; the resulting
program behavior must refer to objects that are <tt>eql</tt> to the
corresponding objects in the source code.
Only the <tt>compile-file</tt>/<tt>load</tt> process is permitted
to copy or coalesce constants (see section <A HREF="node224.html#COMPILERSECTION">25.1</A>).

<P>
<BR><b>[Function]</b><BR>
<tt>eql</tt> <tt><i>x</i></tt> <tt><i>y</i></tt><P>The <tt>eql</tt> predicate is true if its arguments are <tt>eq</tt>,
or if they are numbers of the same type with the same value,
or if they are character objects
that represent the same character.
For example:
<P><pre>
(eql 'a 'b) is false. 
(eql 'a 'a) is true. 
(eql 3 3) is true. 
(eql 3 3.0) is false. 
(eql 3.0 3.0) is true. 
(eql #c(3 -4) #c(3 -4)) is true. 
(eql #c(3 -4.0) #c(3 -4)) is false. 
(eql (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'c)) is false. 
(eql (cons 'a 'b) (cons 'a 'b)) is false. 
(eql '(a . b) '(a . b)) might be true or false. 
(progn (setq x (cons 'a 'b)) (eql x x)) is true. 
(progn (setq x '(a . b)) (eql x x)) is true. 
(eql #\A #\A) is true. 
(eql &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot;) might be true or false. 
(eql &quot;Foo&quot; (copy-seq &quot;Foo&quot;)) is false. 
(eql &quot;FOO&quot; &quot;foo&quot;) is false.
</pre><P>
Normally <tt>(eql 1.0s0 1.0d0)</tt> would be false, under the assumption
that <tt>1.0s0</tt> and <tt>1.0d0</tt> are of distinct data types.
However, implementations that do not provide four distinct floating-point
formats are permitted to ``collapse'' the four formats into some
smaller number of them; in such an implementation <tt>(eql 1.0s0 1.0d0)</tt>
might be true.  The predicate <tt>=</tt> will compare
the values of two numbers even if the numbers are of different types.
<P>
If an implementation supports positive and negative zeros as distinct
values (as in the IEEE proposed standard floating-point format),
then <tt>(eql 0.0 -0.0)</tt> will be false.  Otherwise, when the syntax
<tt>-0.0</tt> is read it will be interpreted as the value <tt>0.0</tt>,
and so <tt>(eql 0.0 -0.0)</tt> will be true.  The predicate <tt>=</tt>
differs from <tt>eql</tt> in that <tt>(= 0.0 -0.0)</tt> will always be true,
because <tt>=</tt> compares the mathematical values of its operands,
whereas <tt>eql</tt> compares the representational values, so to speak.
<P>
Two complex numbers are considered to be <tt>eql</tt>
if their real parts are <tt>eql</tt> and their imaginary parts are <tt>eql</tt>.
For example, <tt>(eql #C(4 5) #C(4 5))</tt> is true and
<tt>(eql #C(4 5) #C(4.0 5.0))</tt> is false.
Note that while <tt>(eql #C(5.0 0.0) 5.0)</tt> is false,
<tt>(eql #C(5 0) 5)</tt> is true.
In the case of <tt>(eql #C(5.0 0.0) 5.0)</tt> the
two arguments are of different types
and so cannot satisfy <tt>eql</tt>; that's all there is to it.
In the case of <tt>(eql #C(5 0) 5)</tt>, however,
<tt>#C(5 0)</tt> is not a complex number but
is always automatically reduced by the rule of complex
canonicalization to the integer <tt>5</tt>,
just as the apparent ratio <tt>20/4</tt> is always simplified to <tt>5</tt>.
<P>
The case of <tt>(eql &quot;Foo&quot; &quot;Foo&quot;)</tt> is discussed above in the description
of <tt>eq</tt>.  While <tt>eql</tt> compares the values of numbers and
characters, it does not compare the contents of strings.  To compare
the characters of two strings, one should use <tt>equal</tt>, <tt>equalp</tt>,
<tt>string=</tt>, or <tt>string-equal</tt>.
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> The Common Lisp function <tt>eql</tt> is similar to the
Interlisp function <tt>eqp</tt>.  However, <tt>eql</tt> considers <tt>3</tt> and
<tt>3.0</tt> to be different, whereas <tt>eqp</tt> considers them to be the same;
<tt>eqp</tt> behaves like the Common Lisp <tt>=</tt> function, not like <tt>eql</tt>,
when both arguments are numbers.

<tt>equal</tt> <tt><i>x</i></tt> <tt><i>y</i></tt><P>The <tt>equal</tt> predicate is true if its arguments are structurally similar
(isomorphic) objects.  A rough rule of thumb is that two objects
are <tt>equal</tt> if and only if their printed representations are the same.
<P>
Numbers and characters are compared as for <tt>eql</tt>.
Symbols are compared as for <tt>eq</tt>.  This method
of comparing symbols can violate the rule
of thumb for <tt>equal</tt> and printed representations,
but only in the infrequently occurring case of two distinct
symbols with the same print name.
<P>
Certain objects that have components are <tt>equal</tt> if they are of the same
type and corresponding components are <tt>equal</tt>.
This test is implemented in a recursive manner and may fail to
terminate for circular structures.
<P>
For conses, <tt>equal</tt> is defined recursively as
the two <i>car</i>'s being <tt>equal</tt> and the two <i>cdr</i>'s being <tt>equal</tt>.
<P>
Two arrays are <tt>equal</tt> only if they are <tt>eq</tt>,
with one exception:
strings and bit-vectors are compared element-by-element.
If either argument has a fill pointer, the fill pointer limits
the number of elements examined by <tt>equal</tt>.
Uppercase and lowercase letters in strings are considered by
<tt>equal</tt> to be distinct.  (In contrast, <tt>equalp</tt> ignores
case distinctions in strings.)
<P>
<hr>
<b>Compatibility note:</b> In Lisp Machine Lisp, <tt>equal</tt> ignores the difference between
uppercase and lowercase letters in strings.
This violates the rule of thumb about
printed representations, however, which is very useful, especially
to novices.  It is also inconsistent with the treatment of single characters,
which in Lisp Machine Lisp are represented as fixnums.
<hr>
<P>
Two pathname objects are <tt>equal</tt> if and only if
all the corresponding components
(host, device, and so on) are equivalent.  (Whether or not
uppercase and lowercase letters are considered equivalent
in strings appearing in components depends on the file
name conventions of the file system.)  Pathnames
that are <tt>equal</tt> should be functionally equivalent.

or if they have components that are all <tt>equalp</tt>.
<P>
Objects that have components are <tt>equalp</tt> if they are of the same

The specializations need not match; for example,
a string and a general array that happens to contain the same characters
will be <tt>equalp</tt> (though definitely not <tt>equal</tt>).
If either argument has a fill pointer, the fill pointer limits
the number of elements examined by <tt>equalp</tt>.

<P>
As part of the X3J13 discussion of this issue
the following observations were made.
    Object equality is not a concept for which there is a uniquely
    determined correct algorithm. The appropriateness of an equality
    predicate can be judged only in the context of the needs of some
    particular program. Although these functions take any type of
    argument and their names sound very generic, <tt>equal</tt> and <tt>equalp</tt> are
    not appropriate for every application. Any decision to use or not
    use them should be determined by what they are documented to do
    rather than by any abstract characterization of their function. If
    neither <tt>equal</tt> nor <tt>equalp</tt> is found to be appropriate in a particular
    situation, programmers are encouraged to create another operator
    that is appropriate rather than blame <tt>equal</tt> or <tt>equalp</tt> for ``doing
    the wrong thing.''
