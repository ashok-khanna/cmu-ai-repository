<H1>AI-related FAQs</H1>
This document contains a list of most of the AI-related FAQs, alphabetized 
by topic (more or less). 
Many of the FAQs are presented in the same format as they
appear in the newsgroup, while others have been further processed and
split into additional documents.  
<P>
This document is created using a locally customized version of Thomas Fine's 
faq2html perl scripts.
