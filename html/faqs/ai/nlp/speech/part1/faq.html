  Q1.6: WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AS HANDICAP AIDS?
  
   Can anyone provide information on speech technology aids for the deaf,
   blind, speech impaired, physically impaired and other groups who may
   benefit from speech technology?
   
    SpeechViewer II
     * Platform: IBM Machines from Mod 25 on.
     * Description: SpeechViewer II is a speech therapy tool. It
       provided graphical feedback of various speech features so that
       speech impaired individuals can improve their speech. It works
       with an audio bandwidth of 7.3 Khz and thus allows the therapist
       to work with sustained vowels and fricatives. A wide range of
       graphics are used to provide adequate variability to hold client
       interest. An extensive set of statistics are gathered which allows
       a therapist to do research or keep therapy records. The speech
       therapy modules are:
          + Awareness - Sound, Loudness, Pitch, Voicing Onset, Voicing
          + Skill Building - Pitch, Voicing, Phonology
          + Patterning - Pitch &#38; Loudness - Waveform &#38; Spectrogram,
            Spectra
          + Clinical Management - Profiles, Models, Client Data
     * Hardware: Requires an IBM M-ACPA (Multimedia-Audio Capture
       Playback Adapter). It has a TI TMS320C25 DSP chip. The input
       sampling rate is 44.1 Khz stereo, 88.2 Khz mono. This is a 16 bit
       card. It has the following jacks: mic in, stereo line in, stereo
       line out, speaker out. Note: This card is being replaced by Mwave
       technology. For more info on Mwave contact Texas Instruments.
     * Price:

     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Q1.7: WHAT SPEECH DATA IS AVAILABLE?
  
   A wide range of speech databases have been collected. These databases
   are primarily for the development of speech synthesis/recognition and
   for linguistic research.
   
   Some databases are free but most appear to be available for a small
   cost. The databases normally require lots of storage space - do not
   expect to be able to ftp all the data you want.
   
    Phonemic Samples
     * First, some basic data. The following ftp sites have samples of

  Q1.9: WHAT "SPEECH LABORATORY ENVIRONMENTS" ARE AVAILABLE?
  
   First, what is a Speech Laboratory Environment? A speech lab is a
   software package which provides the capability of recording, playing,
   analysing, processing, displaying and storing speech. Your computer
   will require audio input/output capability. The different packages
   vary greatly in features and capability - best to know what you want
   before you start looking around.
   
   Most general purpose audio processing packages will be able to process
   speech but do not necessarily have some specialised capabilities for
   speech (e.g. formant analysis).
   
   The following article provides a good survey.
     * Read, C., Buder, E., &#38; Kent, R. "Speech Analysis Systems: An
       Evaluation" Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, pp 314-332,
       April 1992.
       
    Entropic Signal Processing System (ESPS) and Waves

       analysis/processing tools for the UNIX environment. The package
       includes UNIX commands, and a comprehensive C library (which can
       be accessed from other languages). Waves is a graphical front-end
       for speech processing. Speech waveforms, spectrograms, pitch
       traces etc can be displayed, edited and processed in X windows and
       Openwindows (versions 2 &#38; 3). Waves also includes a signal
       labelling utility which provides multiple feature labelling and
       useful features for fast labelling of large speech databases.
       Entropic also distributes HTK (the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit).

    Auditory Toolbox for Matlab
     * Description: This toolbox provides extensions to Matlab which
       are useful to people interested in auditory/cochlear modeling.
       [Matlab is described is the previous section.] This toolbox has
       been tested on both Macintosh and Unix computers. It includes the
       following major models:
          + Lyon's Passive Long Wave Cochlear Model (our conventional
            model)
          + Patterson-Holdsworth ERB Filter bank with Meddis Hair cell
          + Seneff's Auditory Model (Stages I and II)
          + MFCC (Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients from the ASR
            world)
          + Spectrogram
          + Correlogram generation and pitch modeling
          + Simple vowel synthesis

          + 92160 AuditoryToolbox.tar
          + 36405 AuditoryToolbox.tar.Z
   The ".mif.Z" file is a Unix compressed version of the FrameMaker
       documentation. The ".psc.Z" file is a Unix compressed version of
       the Postscript documentation. The ".tar" and ".tar.Z" files are
       Unix TAR archives containing all of the m-functions and C-MEX
       source code. Finally, the ".sea.hqx" file is a Macintosh
       self-extracting archive that has been encoded using BinHex. We do
       provide precompiled version of the three MEX function for the
       Macintosh.
