INSTITUTION FOR FUZZY SYSTEMS AND INTELLIGENT CONTROL, INC.

    Sponsors, organizes, and publishes the proceedings of the International
    Fuzzy Systems and Intelligent Control Conference.  The conference is 
    devoted primarily to computer based feedback control systems that rely on 
    rule bases, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence and soft 
    computing techniques.  The theme of the 1993 conference was "Fuzzy Logic,
    Neural Networks, and Soft Computing."
