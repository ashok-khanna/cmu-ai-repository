Contributions and corrections should be sent to the mailing list
mkant+fuzzy-faq@cs.cmu.edu. 

Note that the mkant+fuzzy-faq@cs.cmu.edu mailing list is for
discussion of the content of the FAQ posting only by the FAQ
maintainers. It is not the place to ask questions about fuzzy logic
and fuzzy expert systems; use the newsgroup comp.ai.fuzzy for that. If
a question appears frequently in that forum, it will get added to the
FAQ list.

The original version of this FAQ posting was prepared by Erik
Horstkotte of SysSoft &#60;erik@syssoft.com&#62;, with significant
contributions by Cliff Joslyn &#60;joslyn@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov&#62;.  The FAQ is
maintained by Mark Kantrowitz &#60;mkant@cs.cmu.edu&#62; with advice from Erik
and Cliff. To reach us, send mail to mkant+fuzzy-faq@cs.cmu.edu.

Thanks also go to Michael Arras &#60;arras@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de&#62; for
running the vote which resulted in the creation of comp.ai.fuzzy,
Yokichi Tanaka &#60;tanaka@til.com&#62; for help in putting the FAQ together,
and Walter Hafner &#60;hafner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de&#62;, Satoru Isaka

contributions to the initial contents of the FAQ.
