Fril Systems Ltd:

   FRIL (Fuzzy Relational Inference Language) is a logic-programming
   language that incorporates a consistent method for handling
   uncertainty, based on Baldwin's theories of support logic, mass
   assignments, and evidential reasoning. Mass assignments give a
   consistent way of manipulating fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainties,
   enabling different forms of uncertainty to be integrated within a
   single framework. Fril has a list-based syntax, similar to the early
   micro-Prolog from LPA. Prolog is a special case of Fril, in which
   programs involve no uncertainty. Fril runs on Unix, Macintosh,
   MS-DOS, and Windows 3.1 platforms.

  NeuFuz is aimed at low end controls applications in automotive, 
  industrial, and appliance areas.  NeuFuz is a neural-fuzzy technology 
  which uses backpropagation techniques to initially select fuzzy rules 
  and membership functions.  Initial stages of design using NeuFuz 
  technology are performed using training data and backpropagation.  
  The result is a fuzzy associative memory (FAM) which implements an 
  approximation of the training data.  By implementing a FAM, rather 
  than a multi-layer perceptron, the designer has a solution which can 
  be understood and tuned to a particular application using Fuzzy Logic 
  design techniques.
