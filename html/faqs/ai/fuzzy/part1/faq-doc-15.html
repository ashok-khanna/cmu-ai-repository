The Fuzzy-Mail and NAFIPS-L mailing lists are now bidirectionally
gatewayed to the comp.ai.fuzzy newsgroup.

NAFIPS Fuzzy Logic Mailing List:

    This is a mailing list for the discussion of fuzzy logic, NAFIPS and 
    related topics, located at the Georgia State University.  The last time
    that this FAQ was updated, there were about 225 subscribers, located
    primarily in North America, as one might expect.  Postings to the mailing
    list are automatically archived.

    The mailing list server itself is like most of those in use on the
    Internet.  If you're already familiar with Internet mailing lists, the
    only thing you'll need to know is that the name of the server is

       listproc@listproc.gsu.edu 

    and the name of the mailing list itself is

       nafips-l@listproc.gsu.edu 

    If you're not familiar with this type of mailing list server, the
    easiest way to get started is to send the following message to
    listproc@listproc.gsu.edu:
       help 
    You will receive a brief set of instructions by email within
    a short time.

    Once you have subscribed, you will begin receiving a copy of each message
    that is sent by anyone to nafips-l@listproc.gsu.edu, and any message that 
    you send to that address will be sent to all of the other subscribers.

Technical University of Vienna Fuzzy Logic Mailing List:

    This is a mailing list for the discussion of fuzzy logic and related
    topics, located at the Technical University of Vienna in Austria.  The
    last time this FAQ was updated, there were about 980 subscribers.
    The list is slightly moderated (only irrelevant mails are rejected)
    and is two-way gatewayed to the aforementioned NAFIPS-L list and to
    the comp.ai.fuzzy internet newsgroup. Messages should therefore be
    sent only to one of the three media, although some mechanism for
    mail-loop avoidance and duplicate-message avoidance is activated.
    In addition to the mailing list itself, the list server gives
    access to some files, including archives and the "Who is Who in Fuzzy
    Logic" database that is currently under construction by Robert Fuller
    &#60;rfuller@finabo.abo.fi&#62;. There is also a WWW interface to the list
    at <A NAME=id15 HREF="http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/marchives/fuzzy-mail/index.html">http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/marchives/fuzzy-mail/index.html</A> as well
    as a <A NAME=id16 HREF="ftp://mira.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/pub/mlowner">ftp://mira.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/pub/mlowner</A> site to access such
    files as the whoiswhoinfuzzy file mentioned above.

    Like many mailing lists, this one uses Anastasios Kotsikonas's LISTPROC
    system.  If you've used this kind of server before, the only thing you'll
    need to know is that the name of the server is
      listproc@dbai.tuwien.ac.at
    and the name of the mailing list is
      fuzzy-mail@dbai.tuwien.ac.at

    If you're not familiar with this type of mailing list server, the easiest
    way to get started is to send the following message to
    listproc@dbai.tuwien.ac.at:
      get fuzzy-mail info

    You will receive a brief set of instructions by email within a short time.

    Once you have subscribed, you will begin receiving a copy of each message
    that is sent by anyone to fuzzy-mail@dbai.tuwien.ac.at, and any
    message that you send to that address will be sent to all of the other
    subscribers.

Fuzzy Logic in Japan:

    There are two mailing lists for fuzzy logic in Japan. Both forward
    many articles from the international mailing lists, but the other
    direction is not automatic. 

    Asian Fuzzy Mailing System (AFMS):
       afuzzy@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp

       To subscribe, send a message to aserver@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp
       with your name and email address. Membership is restricted to
       within Asia as a general rule.

       The list is executed manually, and is maintained by Prof. Mikio
       Nakatsuyama, Department of Electronic Engineering, Yamagata
       University, 4-3-16 Jonan, Yonezawa 992 Japan, phone +81-238-22-5181, 
       fax +81-238-24-2752, email nakatsu@ea5.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp. 

       All messages to the list have the Subject line replaced with "AFMS".
       The language of the list is English.

    Fuzzy Mailing List - Japan:
       fuzzy-jp@sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp

       This is an unmoderated list, with mostly original contributions
       in Japanese (JIS-code).

       To subscribe, send subscriptions to the listserv
          fuzzy-jp-request@sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp

       If you need to speak to a human being, send mail to the list
       owners, 
          fuzzy-admin@tamlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp
       Itsuo Hatono and Motohide Umano of Osaka University.
