Lessons Learned from Implemented Software Architectures for Physical Agents
===========================================================================

We are interested in organizational concepts for artificial agents
that function in the everyday world of manufacturing floors, office
buildings, and houses or in the specialized worlds of space or nuclear
reactors. 

In recent years, a sufficient number of researchers have put forth
software frameworks for organizing intelligence in agents beyond the
original first few who began such investigations [e.g., SOAR and
NASREM] that a symposium to discuss the issues outlined below is
warranted. We are seeing architectures with as few as three and as 
many as five layers of cognition or control, for single agents or
multiple agents, designed to accommodate hard real-time constraints or
involved user interfaces, handling purely reactive or a combination of
deliberate and reactive control, which are subsumptive or
supervenient, and most of which are designed to function as part of a
physical agent. 

The goal of this workshop is to shed light into reasons for
architectural decisions in building artificial agents. Many important
questions affect architectural decisions. For this workshop, we ask
the following questions only with respect to architectural decisions.

Coordination-- How should the agent arbitrate/coordinate/cooperate its
behaviors and actions?  Is there a need for central behavior
coordination?

Interfaces-- How can human expertise be easily brought into an agent's
decisions?  Will the agent need to translate natural language
internally before it can interact with the world?  How should an agent
capture mission intentions or integrate various levels of autonomy or
shared control?  Can restricted vocabularies be learned and shared by
agents operating in the same environment?

Representation-- How much internal representation of knowledge and
skills is needed?  How should the agent organize and represent its
internal knowledge and skills?  Is more than one representational
formalism needed?

Structural-- How should the computational capabilities of an agent be
divided, structured, and interconnected?  What is the best
decomposition/granularity of architectural components?  What is gained
by using a monolithic architecture versus a multi-level, distributed,
or massively parallel architecture?  Are embodied semantics important
and how should they be implemented?  How much does each level/component
of an agent architecture have to know about the other
levels/components?

Performance-- What types of performance goals and metrics can
realistically be used for agents operating in dynamic, uncertain, and
even actively hostile environments?  How can an architecture make
guarantees about its performance with respect to the time-critical
aspect of the agent's physical environment?  What are the performance
criteria for deciding what activities take place in each
level/component of the architecture?

Psychology-- Why should we build agents that mimic anthropomorphic
functionalities?  How far can/should we draw metaphoric similarities
to human/animal psychology?  How much should memory organization
depend on human/animal psychology?

Simulation-- What, if any, role can advanced simulation technology
play in developing and verifying modules and/or systems?  Can we have
standard virtual components/test environments that everybody trusts
and can play a role in comparing systems to each other?  How far can
development of modules profitably proceed before they should be
grounded in a working system?  How is the architecture affected by its
expected environment and its actual embodiment?

Learning-- How can a given architecture support learning?  How can
knowledge and skills be moved between different layers of an agent
architecture?

We invite researchers in intelligent mobile robots, robot
manipulators, autonomous creatures (animats), and neuroscience as
applied to autonomous agents to join us in discussing these questions.

To allow for a more practical discussion of the issues, all
submissions should focus on an agent or agents performing a specific
task, such as keeping a house clean, maintaining the space station, or
delivering parts on a factory floor. Be very specific about how your
agent(s) organize(s) its knowledge and skills in order to perform this
task and what mechanisms your agent(s) use(s) to invoke the correct
knowledge or skill at the appropriate time. Please include the design
decisions you made in organizing your agent's architecture for the
task.  Then, through this specific example, show how your agent's
architecture addresses some of the questions listed above.

The symposium will consist of presentations, invited talks, and task
groups. Based on submissions, we will divide the workshop into
specific task groups and, after discussions, come together for
synthesis.  We are tentatively proposing that the group produce as a
minimum a set of answers for a portion of the discussion areas listed
above.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

Potential attendees should submit either an extended abstract or a
full paper, neither of which should exceed 20 pages.  If you are
submitting a paper, we prefer that it not have been published
elsewhere.  If you are sending a paper that has already been

	IEEE Real-Time Technology and Application Symposium
	===================================================

			May 15-17, 1995
		       Chicago, Illinois


RTAS'94 is the successor to the 11th Workshop on Real-Time
Operating Systems and Software.

Since the early 80's, we have witnessed an increased interest in
real-time technology because of the need for scientific solutions
for time-constrained information processing in various
applications such as avionics, multimedia, robotics, automated
process control, and manufacturing.  Founded in 1983, the IEEE
Workshop on Real-Time Operating Systems and Software (RTOSS) has
been an important annual forum for exchanging information of
emerging principles and practices underlying real-time technology.
Consequently, we are seeing a substantial number of new
researchers tackling the many challenging problems that
remain. Due to the interest shown in, and the success of, the
RTOSS, the IEEE technical committee on real-time systems has
decided to convert RTOSS into a full symposium, the real-Time
Technology and Applications Symposium.

The purpose of this symposium is to bring together developers and
researchers from universities, industry, and government to advance
real-time technology and its applications. Papers on all aspects
of real-time computing are sought, including operating systems and
scheduling, fault-tolerance, databases, programming languages,
tools, communication networks, architectures, performance
modeling, formal methods, case studies, and applications. Of
particular interest are papers detailing experiments and
implementations. This year we are planning special sessions in the
areas such as Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems and
Multimedia. Papers on these topics are especially encouraged.

Manuscripts should be limited to 20 double spaced pages. Papers
submitted to the Symposium should not be submitted elsewhere. Six
copies of the paper should reach the program chair no later than
January 7, 1995. Authors will be notified of acceptance by Feb 28,
1995. Final camera-ready manuscripts will be due by March 31,
1995. Proposals for two-hour tutorials in technical areas of the
conference are also solicited.  Tutorial proposals should be
submitted to the program chair by January 7, 1995.

     review for a journal or another conference. Nor will it be submitted
     for such during IJCAI's review period.''

Policy on Multiple Submissions

IJCAI will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is
under review for a journal or another conference. Authors are also
expected not to submit their papers elsewhere during IJCAI's review
period.  These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences,
not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited
audience.

Review Criteria

Papers will be subject to peer review, but this review will not be
``blind'' (that is, the reviewers will be aware of the names of the
authors). Selection criteria include accuracy and originality of
ideas, clarity and significance of results and the quality of the
presentation. The decision of the Program Committee, taking into
consideration the individual reviews, will be final and cannot be
appealed.  Papers selected will be scheduled for presentation and will
be printed in the proceedings. Authors of accepted papers, or their
representatives, are expected to present their papers at the
conference.

Distinguished Paper Awards

The Program  Committee will  distinguish one  or more  papers of  exceptional
quality for special awards.  This decision will in  no way depend on  whether
the authors choose to enhance their paper with a video presentation.

Other Calls

Calls for  tutorial  and  workshop  proposals  and  video  presentations  for
IJCAI-95 will be issued shortly.

  10th IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT CONTROL

                    August 27 - 29, 1995
                   MONTEREY MARRIOTT HOTEL
                MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA 93940 USA


SCOPE

The central theme of the tenth IEEE / ISIC will be threefold:
Hybrid Systems, Integrated Control and Diagnostics, and,
Non-conventional Robotic Applications. Recent advances in
technology and the ever increasing system complexity requires
new innovative approaches to systems modeling, analysis,
synthesis, and control. Hybrid systems, containing both
continuous and discrete state systems interacting with each
other, are essential for designing autonomous control systems.
Integrated control and diagnostics is required for real-time,
on-line failure detection, identification and recovery of
complex systems, and requires information fusion from a
diverse set of sources, i.e., sensors, controllers, databases,
etc. Robotics and automation has matured to the point that
robotics based applications are expanding to non-conventional
fields including applications in the textiles / apparel
industry, composites and the medical field. Virtual Reality
and Multi-media are playing an increasing role in telerobotics
(telemanipulation, teleoperation), virtual manufacturing and
prototyping. Thus, the Symposium objectives are to discuss and
present the most recent advances in the field. This year,
emphasis will be given to enhance the European participation
and encourage scientists and researchers from Europe to submit
contributed papers and / or proposals for invited sessions and
tutorials.

TOPICS

Symposium topics include, but are not limited to:
adaptive control, applications / implementations (aircraft /
spacecraft, automotive systems / IVHS, composites, consumer
products, manufacturing systems, process control, robotics,
textiles / apparel industry, underwater / land vehicles),
architectures for intelligent control, autonomous control
systems, CIM and FMS systems, computer control, design
techniques for intelligent controllers, discrete event systems,
distributed intelligent control, failure detection and
identification, fuzzy systems / fuzzy control, hierarchical
intelligent control, hybrid systems, knowledge-based and expert
systems, linear and nonlinear systems, machine learning /
adaptive systems, man-machine systems, mathematical analysis of
intelligent systems, modeling of intelligent systems,
multi-sensor fusion / integration, neural networks / neural
control, numerical methods, planning and scheduling systems,
quality control, real-time software, reconfigurable control,
telerobotics, virtual prototyping, and virtual reality
applications.

INVITED SESSIONS / TUTORIALS

Four copies of proposals for: invited sessions including all
full papers and a cover letter indicating the scope of the
proposed session, or, tutorials including a detailed outline of
the proposed topic, must be submitted to the Invited Sessions /
Tutorials Chair by MARCH 15, 1995. Invited sessions may include
survey papers and possibly a panel discussion.

SCOPE
	Novel approaches for advanced robotics systems will be applied
in the industrial production and in many other areas in the near
future. For the employees to be able to work with these systems, new
ergonomical, social and cultural aspects must be considered. At the
workshop, new aspects of design and case studies shall be overviewed
and discussed.All possible application areas and environments will be
focussed on, including those that can dispense with human work for
difficult activities in harsh, demanding or dangerous
environments. Assistance for the disabled or handicapped and new
applications in the services sector are particularly demanding.

The outlined design aspects should deal with

-) the system design, specifically of the man-machine interface, for 
autonomous, semi-autonomous and tele-operated mode and for tele-existence;
-)the organizational and social aspects with respect to the environment in 
which the system is embedded;
-) the cultural aspect due to different living and working traditions and 
conditions of the people involved;
-) the economic aspects.Practical solutions (e.g. demonstrated with video) are 
preferred to purely theoretical consideration.

CALL FOR PAPERS
Contributions to the topics mentioned are welcome. Five copies of the abstract 
(approximately 400 words in English) should be received not later  than April 
1st, 1995

DEADLINES
Submission of abstracts:	1st April, 1995

2nd announcement

	   Practice  and  Future  of  Autonomous  Agents:
			     ASI-AA-95

		   23 September - 1 October 1995
		      Centro Stefano Franscini
		 Monte Verit'a, Ticino, Switzerland


(Follow-up meeting of the NATO Advanced Study Institute "The Biology
and Technology of Intelligent Autonomous Agents", which took place
Spring 1993 in Trento, Italy).


Sponsored by:

  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; Computer Science Department,
  University of Zurich; SGAICO (Swiss Group for Artificial Intelligence and
  Cognitive Science); Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT; Applied AI
  Systems, Ottawa, Canada; Nippon Signal, Japan; Uchidate, Japan.

Goal of the Advanced Study Institute "Practice and Future of Autonomous Agents"

  The goal of the Advanced Study Institute (ASI) is to bring together the
  world's leading experts in the field of autonomous agents (AA) for an
  extended period of time in order to bring the existing research community
  closer together and to extend it to younger researchers.  As a result we
  expect a state-of-the-art assessment of the field, including a research
  agenda for the near future.  We hope that many joint research endeavors
  will emerge from the close collaboration in the workshops.

Current Situation:  Autonomous Agents Research in 1995

  Because technical skills about robot building are now widely available,
  promoting these skills at an ASI is no longer the primary objective.
  However, from a conceptual point of view there are still many fundamental
  issues in AA design that we do not yet sufficiently understand.
  Moreover, there is less need to provide complete coverage of all aspects
  of the field since by now they are well-known in the research community.
  For this reason the meeting will be focused on a number of core aspects
  of real world autonomous agents.  When the study institute will take
  place, roughly 2 1/2 years will have passed since the one in Trento took
  place.  Therefore, it is important to evaluate what has been achieved in
  the meantime.

Main topics of the Advanced Study Institute

  The field of autonomous agents has significantly matured during the last
  few years.  We are beyond the stage where robots are designed mainly
  based on intuition.  It is therefore a good time to make an assessment of
  the current state of the theory of autonomous agents.

  Theory: What are the recent developments in the theory of autonomous
	  agents?

  Design: How can autonomous agents be designed which show sophisticated
	  kinds of behavior?

  Performance measures: How can the performance of the agents be
	  quantified?

Topic areas:

  The Cog project; behavioral economics approach; evolutionary approaches;
  "complete autonomous systems"; self-organization, learning, and
  grounding; dynamical systems; collective behavior; industrial session.

  Francesco Mondada,      Dimitrios Lambrinos,         and others.

Format:

  The ASI consists of the following parts: lectures, workshops, background
  lectures, poster/demo session, special robot event, panel discussions.


  Lectures. The lectures will provide a state-of-the-art overview of the
	field including the currently hottest research topics.  They have
	a tutorial and a research aspect and should be attended by
	everyone.

  Workshops. The afternoons and some evenings are reserved for workshops.
	They are conducted in parallel and will consist of concrete case
	studies with active contributions of all the participants.  This
	can also include presentations.  The case studies will include all
	three aspects of AA, namely theory, design, and performance
	evaluation and will address questions like: How could the designs
	of particular agents be improved?  How would the agents look like
	if viewed from a different design perspective?  etc.  Because the
	participants already have experience in the field these workshops
	will be a main forum for exchanging ideas.  A list of the workshops
	will be announced early next year.

  Background lectures. To embed the topics of the workshop into a larger
	framework a number of background lectures will be held in the
	evenings.

  Poster/Demo Sessions. The poster and demonstration sessions will give all
	participants the opportunity to present their own work.  This is
	also a forum to facilitate communication during the ASI.

  Panel discussions. Panel discussions will be organized to work out the
	strengths, weaknesses, points of agreement and disagreement of the
	various approaches.

  Special event. A special event will be organized which should capture the
	"spirit" of the ASI.  Because the various workshop groups will have
	their own robots to work with, the goal is having some or all of
	them work together on a common task (heterogeneous collective
	robots).  This could not only be a lot of fun, but is also of great
	theoretical interest.  More details on this special event will be
	announced later.

Application Procedure

  Deadline for applications:   April 13, 1995
  Notification of acceptance:  May 15, 1995

  The application should include:

    1. Statement of contribution.  A two-page description of the
       contribution participants plan to make in terms of demos,
       contribution to workshops, etc.
    2. Poster/Demo.  Each participant is expected to contribute a poster
       presentation.  Demonstrations are also of great interest.  An
       abstract should be submitted with the application.
    3. Background information.  A short description of the research
       background (CV) should be submitted with the application.
    4. Robots and simulations.

  Participants are encouraged to bring along their own robots and/or
  simulation environments.  It would be great to have a large variety of
  different types of robots for the special event.  They should all think
  about the special event and prepare their own robots in a way that will
  make success on a common task/game more likely.  Please state if you can
  bring a robot (and if yes, what kind).  This is not a condition for
  participation.

Fees

  Registration:    academic CHF 400.00, industrial CHF 600.00
  Room and board:  academic CHF 800.00, industrial CHF 1400.00

  Note: This includes 8 nights at the hotel, 3 meals a day, and coffee
  during breaks. The calculation of the costs for room and board are based
  on the assumption that the participants reside in the conference hotel
  (double rooms with a superb view of the Lago Maggiore and the Swiss and
  Italian mountains).  If you prefer a single room, there are many local
  hotels available in Ascona, a nearby village which is a very popular
  tourist resort.

Symposium sponsors emphasize that we are deliberately looking beyond the 
individuals and organizations that are usually involved on military and Navy 
R&#38;D.  We are convinced that there are many investigators who are following 
paths very relevant to Navy needs who do not know of those needs; nor do 
government project people know of all investigators.

The Seventh Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence
(EPIA'95) will be held at Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal,
between October 3-6, 1995.  As in previous cases  ('89, '91,
and '93),   EPIA'95   will   be  run  as  an   international
conference,   English   being  the  official  language.  The
scientific  program  includes  tutorials,  invited lectures,
demonstrations, and paper presentations. The Conference will
include three parallel workshops on  Expert  Systems,  Fuzzy
Logic and Neural  Networks,  and  Applications  of  A.I.  to
Robotics  and  Vision  Systems.  These  workshops  will  run
simultaneously (see below) and  consist  of  invited  talks,
panels,    paper    presentations   and   poster   sessions.
Applications  of  Artificial  Intelligence  to Robotics  and
Vision Systems Workshop  may last for either 1, 2 or 3 days,
depending on the quantity and quality of submissions.


  APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO ROBOTICS AND 
                   VISION SYSTEMS WORKSHOP

During  the  last   few   years,   Artificial   Intelligence
techniques  have been successfully applied to a large number
of problems in robotics and computer vision.
This   workshop  aims  to  provide  an  overview   of   such
applications specially featuring real prototypes and systems
(e.g., robotic insects, autonomous mobile robots, etc.).
The availability of demonstrations  (robots, vision systems,
videos and demonstration software) is highly appreciated and
will be taken into account in assessing submissions.
The  workshop  will  be  divided  into   two   areas:  paper
presentations   and  system  exhibitions,  where  prototypes
related to the presentations will be demonstrated.
The  organization invites you to participate in the workshop
via paper presentations and/or system demonstrations.


                         EXHIBITIONS

In  order  to  illustrate   and   to   support   theoretical
presentations   the  organization   will   provide  adequate
conditions (space and facilities) for  exhibitions regarding
the three workshops mentioned. These exhibitions can include
software running systems  (several platforms are available),
video  presentations  (PAL-G VHS system),  robotics  systems
(such  as  robotics  insects,  and autonomous  robots),  and
posters.  On  the  one  hand,  this  space  will  allow  the
presentation  of  results and real-world applications of the
research developed by our community and,  on  the  other  it
will  serve  as a source of motivation to students and young
researchers.

	American Association of Artificial Intelligence a robotics
	competition is sponsored. Rules and locations vary from year
	to year.  See conference announcements for details.

------------------------------
AUVS International Aerial Robotics Competition:

 The AUVS International Aerial Robotics Competitiont is a competition
sponsored by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems (See above)
to encourage aspiring engineers and scientists to pursue careers in
fields allied to unmanned system technology, particularily in the more
difficult realm of unmanned aerial vehicles.  It is a yearly
competition held on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology
in Atlanta, GA.

The general goal of the competition is to create autonomous flying
vehicles capable of carrying out a set of predefined tasks. The
vehicles must compete based on their ability to sense the structured
enviroment of the Competition Arena. They may be intelligent or
preprogrammed, but they must not be flown by a remote human operator.

The vehicles must start from a designated starting area within the
arena, locate a pick-up ring containing six randomly placed disks, and
transfer each disk one at a time to a drop-off ring. A three-foot high
central barrier separates the rings that are six feet in diameter and
80 feet apart. The entire arena is 60' x 120'.

BEAM Robot Olympics:
	Contact:	Mark Tilden &#60;mwtilden@math.uwaterloo.ca&#62;

 BEAM stands for Biology, Electronics, Art and Mechanics -- which were
the original concepts behind BEAM.  Draw from biology into electronics
and mechanics and make it artful.  Tilden advocates using the parts
from discarded electronics items such as Walkmans, disk drives, etc.,
to make machines that moved.  He avoids the use of computers and
microcontrollers in his machines.  The original SolarRunner consisted
of parts from a Walkman, a solar cell from a solar calculator, some
brass tubing, part of a printer roller, a couple of transistors, a
zener diode, a capacitor and a resistor.  Most, if not all, of
Tilden's machines are solar powered and autonomous.

The Second annual Picnic Day Micromouse Contest at UC Davis.
Saturday, April 22, 1995
	URL: <A NAME=id16 HREF="http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/">http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/</A>  under misc.

Last year for this event, we packed a 450 person lecture hall to the
bursting point.  We had closed circuit TV set up so that even the
people in the back could see at least reasonably well.  It was a real
blast last year, so don't miss out on the fun this year!  This contest
helps provide a trial run for new mice, so that they will be well
prepared to enter officially sanctioned IEEE contests.  In our case,
the local contest will take place two weeks following Picnic Day.

This is an open contest, and anyone may participate.  Last year, we
had about 8 participants, one from as far away as UC San Diego (~600
miles).  The mazes, as last year, will be created by a neutral third
party, and will not be revealed until shortly before the start of the
contest.

If anyone thinks they may be interested in participating, I would
appreciate a quick reply, so that I may add you to my mailing list.
If anyone has contacts (pref. e-mail) with any school active in
micromouse, I would very much appreciate a quick note.

Last year, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sponsored this contest and
provided a trophy for the winner.  (Last year, that was University of
Nevada, Reno.)  I am hopeful they will do likewise this year.

More information will be forthcoming as the time approaches.  This
will include an online copy of the rules under which the contest will
be run.

IJCAI-95 Robot Competition

Raja Chatila (raja@laas.fr) and Dave Miller (dmiller@azrael.mitre.org)
are robotic events co-organizers for IJCAI-95 in Montreal next August.
If you think you might be interested in participating in any of the
events described below, or would like some additional information,
please feel free to drop Raja or Dave a line. To get on the mailing
list for these events send email to Dave Miller,
dmiller@azrael.mitre.org

1) Robot Competition 95:
	This event will be similar to the robot competition held at
AAAI-94.  Research robots will compete in a set of generalized
navigation and navigation/manipulation tasks.  As in the 94 contest,
the bulk of the trials will be done offline, and the finals and an
exhibition will be held during a public session for the conference.
David Kortenkamp (korten@mickey.jsc.nasa.gov) is the point of contact
for more details on this event.

2) Intelligent Wheelchair Competition:
	This is another robot contest, but this time the focus is on a
particular application: robotic mobility assistants for the severly
disabled. The competition tasks will include things such as room to
room navigation, speed trials down crowded hallways and through
doorways, and docking with desks and tables.  Each robot must be able
to carry a human user, and all communications with the robot must be
done by the user (no radios, etc).  The contest goals are to see who
can make the most capable chair with the best user interface (if a
user could type well, or operate a joystick competently, than an
ordinary wheelchair would do!). Contact:
ijcai-wheelchair@azrael.mitre.org


	To encourage participation in this new event, especially in
institutions that have not yet dealt with assistive robotics, KISS
Institute for Practical Robotics (kipr@src.umd.edu) has assembled a
low-cost intelligent wheelchair starter system and is selling it, at
cost, to schools interested in this IJCAI event. Send them some mail
for more info.

3) Robot exhibition (not-so-stupid robot tricks)
	This will be a time and place for some unique robot systems to
show off their stuff. The participants in this event should have a
demonstration that is dynamic and of wide appeal. Examples might
include: bi-pedal walking robots; robot teams playing soccer
(football); robot interpretive (non-random) dance. This is not meant
to be an industrial robot show, and product demonstrations will not be
strongly discouraged. This is meant to be an intelligent and
innovative robot show.

More information on all of these events will be forthcoming, but his to get
everyone started thinking. Hope to see you all in Montral,

International Fire-Fighting Home Robot Contest

The Connecticut Robotics Society and Trinity College are again
sponsoring the international Fire-Fighting Home Robot contest on
Sunday, April 23, 1995 at the Trinity College campus in Hartford,
Ct. The contest is open to everyone and has different categories which
will enable anyone of any age, ability or experience level to compete
and possibly win.

The challenge will be to build a computer controlled Robotic device
(not radio-controlled) that can move through a model of a single floor
of a house, look for fire (a lit candle), and then extinguish it. The
model house will be eight feet by eight feet with walls, hallways and
rooms. Contestants will be given the exact layout of the house with
the official rules. The Robot that searches the house, finds the
candle, and extinguishes it in the shortest time will win. The Robots
must be less than one foot on a side and can be tethered to a personal
computer or controlled by a self-contained microprocessor. There will
be different judging criteria so that any Robot can be a winner
regardless of its simplicity, complexity or sophistication.

This all-day international event will be the culmination of months of
work and effort by Robotists of all ages and from all over. Last
year's contest generated inquiries and participants from 41 states and
27 foreign countries.  The entrants ranged from MIT professors to
fourth graders.

There will be two divisions in this years contest. A Junior division for those
in High School and younger and a Senior division for everyone else. There will
be a prize of $1,000 awarded to the top winner in each division with additional
prizes to other winners in those divisions. All entrants will receive an award
and there will be separate special prizes for the winners in each category.

For a copy of the rules and to be put on the official mailing list, please send
$3 (cash, check or money order) to Jake Mendelssohn, 190 Mohegan Drive, West
Hartford, CT 06117

&#60;chriso@lance.colostate.edu&#62;

Registration deadline:  December 31, 1994

Decathalon: The decathlon is a national competition sponsored by SAE to involve
undergraduate engineers in the creative design of machines that walk.
The competition includes preparation and presentation of a paper,
judging of over-all design merits, and the ten walking events.  Judges
are representatives &#62;from the robotics industry.  Social events, a
keynote speaker, and tours are also provided.  A detailed rules and
registration packet is available.

Team Spirit: This competition emphasizes collaboration of engineering
disciplines in a teamwork environment.  It encourages students to be
organized, to cooperate, and to share knowledge from their respective
fields, resulting in an experience that closely models the real-world
workplace.

What is a walking machine?  A walking machine is a mobile machine
propelled by articulated mechanisms, or "legs."  Each leg must have
one or more joints or hinges by which it moves relative to all other
legs or the frame, supporting the machine discontinuously.  A leg may
pivot, slip, or slide on the supporting surface during walking motion,
but it cannot roll.  Wheeled or tracked vehicles are excluded.
Walking machines have potential applications in space exploration,
undersea missions, mining, radioactive and other dangerous
environments, the military, and mobility for the handicapped.

Judging and Awards Cash prizes will be awarded to the top three teams
based on total points accumulated.  All teams will receive recognition
awards.

History: The National Robotic Walking Machine Decathlon was initiated
in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Colorado State University
in 1986.  The idea was to create a student design competition at the
cutting edge of technology with an emphasis on design.  In eight years
it has gone from a competition in which none of the four machines
present were able to complete the first event, to one where there are
some very capable machines completing all ten events, and in which
there is close competition.  The events themselves continue to evolve
to reflect relevant applications of robotics technology.  The events
traditionally have included such tasks as stair climbing, maneuvering
through obstacles, and autonomous sensor guidance.

------------------------------
Sumo Robot Competition:
	Sumo is a traditional Japanese sport in which two very large
half-naked men try to push each other out of a circle called the
Dohyou. The winner of the game is the guy who has not touched the
ground with his hand or hasn't stepped out of the circle before the
other guy did.

There is a Robot Sumo Tournament in Japan, that is held in December
every year in Tokyo. The rule of the Tournament is same as the real
Sumo except two robots fight rather than naked guys. The task of the
game is quite simple: push the opponent out of the circle.

The regulations are as follows:
1. The area of the base cannot exceed 20cmX20cm before game starts,
   It is unlimited in height and can expand after the game starts.
2. The weight cannot exceed 3kg.
3. Use of internal/external combustion engine is prohibited.
4. Intention to harm the opponent or the Dohyou (playground which
   includes the circle) is not allowed.
5. Contestants are free to choose control techniques, but they are
   divided into 2 categories:

	Radio Controlled: Contestants can use ordinary commercial R/C
	equipment and remotely guide their robots.

	Stand-alone: Robots cannot be controlled externally by
	contestants with the exception of pushing a start button when
	the contest begins.

To avoid interference with the humans who set the robots on the
Dohyou, the Stand Alone category has a special rule which says that
the game will starts exactly 5 seconds after the official signals the
start.  It means that the contestant will push a start button (or
some- thing else) for the robot the same time as the offical's
signal. The robot must keep the start position for 5 seconds, and the
person who pushed the button must leave the Dohyou in that time.
Therefore, the robots in the Stand Alone category must have at a start
button and a means of timing the five seconds.

Progression in the competition consists of three game matches between
randomly selected robots. Last year [1992] 150 robots were in the
Radio Controlled category and 190 were in the Stand Alone category. If
you beat six or seven opponents, you can win the first prize of
1,000,000Yen or US$7,700. The second prize is 500,000Yen or
US$3,850. [edited from a message by Mato Hattori]

New this year is the addition of 4 BEAM events (Solaroller, Photovore,
Walkers, and Aesthetics).  More details will be available as soon as
the rulebook is available.

In the interest of promoting science and technology to the public
and foster enthusiasm and creativity amongst students, the
Western Canadian Robot Games committee holds an annual robotic
contest in a centralized western Canadian location.
 
This email message is sent to you in the hopes you may pass it on
to suitable instructors, professors, staff and students to invite
them to our next contest!

The IEEE student branch at SAIT challenge all SUMO alumni, students,
instructors, and inventive individuals to design and enter your robots
in one or more of our contests:

                               BEAM Events
 
ROBOTIC SUMO WRESTLING: 
The Tradition Continues
 
This contest matches your own creation with another robot in the
field of combat where brute strength and cat-like reflexes
combine to create the ultimate battle!  The challenge is to
create a robot whose sole purpose is to push, throw, flip, drag,
or otherwise move your opponent out of a five foot diameter
circular ring within 3 minutes.
 
In the tradition of an ancient Japanese contest of similar name,
SUMO wrestling robots can use any trick the creator conceives to
get the job done, within the following limits:
 
     *  No robot may be used which is a physical threat to other
        contestants or the audience. (i.e., Explosions, fire,
        bullets, mace etc...)
     *  Robots must fit within a 9" x 9" square when the
        competition begins, but may expand to a larger size
        after battle starts. Height is unrestricted at all
        times.
     *  Robots must be 11 pounds or less in weight.
     *  After the battle is over, contestants are responsible
        for cleaning up any debris in the ring to the

There are two separate classes to SUMO robotic wrestling: 
Autonomous and Remote-Control.
 
Remote Control  robots may be a radio or wired-remote control and 
may be operated by a biological (human, usually).
 
Autonomous Robots must carry on-board all power and intelligence
required to seek and conquer the enemy.  
 
Each robot class will be awarded its own prize!
(Prizes will also be awarded for the most humorous entry)
 
                              ATOMIC HOCKEY
 
You have never seen the NHL like this before!  A head-to-head
game of robot mayhem played out on an atomic scale as each
competitor fights for the opportunity to gather more protons than
his opponent while avoiding the ever present electrons!
 
Played out in a 5 foot diameter circular ring lined with a 2 inch
high wall, the robots must locate and gather Ping-Pong balls
(protons) and deposit them in their own goal (the nucleus) within
a three minute period while their opponents do the same.  Each
proton carries a score of +1 point.  
 
Unfortunately, the ring also contains an equal number of small
metal balls (electrons) worth -1 point each.  Each electron in
your nucleus reduces your score by one point, so be careful to
avoid them (or at least put them in your opponent's nucleus)!
 
     *  Robots are to be a maximum of 9" x 9" square with
        unlimited height and have no weight restriction.
     *   Robots must not pose any physical threat to biologicals
        (see SUMO rules).
     *  Autonomous robots may put any signaling device they wish
        in their nucleus to help the robot locate the goal.
     *  Aggressive and devious play between robots is
        encouraged, so long as no damage occurs to the ring or
        room.
 
As with Robotic SUMO Wrestling, there are two categories: Autonomous
and Remote Controlled ( Radio or Tethered ) New for 1994 is the
introduction of the BEAM Solaroller, Photovore, Walker and
BEAM-Aesthetics events - more details to follow!
