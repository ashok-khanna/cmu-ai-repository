[10] What Robotics related products are there?
	Robots are amazingly interdisciplinary; systems are comprised
of mechanics, electronics, hardware and software and issues germane to
all these catagories. As a result, the design and constructions of
such systems requires a corresponding variety of components and parts.

This section provides information about products available for some of
these areas.

------------------------------
[10.1] Sensors

	This list covers only the most frequently requested types of
robot sensors. These include point-range sensors, cameras, and
acoustic devices. See Sensors magazine &#60;in periodical section of this
FAQ&#62; directory for a large and comprehensive list. This list covers
the following: 

	[10.1.1] Cameras
	[10.1.2] Inertial measurement devices and gyros
	[10.1.3] Rangefinding devices
	[10.1.4] Force/torque, accelerometers, tactile

[10.1.1] Cameras

	There are a large number of cameras on the market and even
many consumer products such as the smaller camcorders are inexpensive
and suitable for some imaging applications. I'll try to list some
different and unusual ones here.
	Note that although some of these cameras are very small many
of them are appended to a large box of electronics via a cable that
supplies power and transmits video. For mobile applications DC power
inputs may be an issue as well. I've also included servo-lens products
as well in this section.

[10.1.2] Inertial measurement devices and gyros
	This includes such devices as accelerometers such as
accelerometers, gyros, and inertial devices used for measuring
orientation or acceleration of moving vehicles. Accelerometers are
devices for measuring the rate of change in velocity and can provide
estimations of distance or be used to detect high forces.

There are several gyros mainly for radio controlled helicopters. These
are rate gyros, used to sense the rate of turn about a particular axis
(usually vertical, for tail rotor control), and are designed to
connect between an R/C receiver and a servo.

These gyros work by modifying the PWM signal that the rx produces,
before it gets to the servo. The sensing is usually done by a linear
hall effect device, which senses the position of a magnet on the
bottom of the flywheel assembly. The gyros have both sensitivity and
gain controls, and some can be switched on and off remotely. They have
been used for sensing rotation about an axis for a VR headset, with
some success. The big advantage is they are relatively cheap, the big
disadvantage is high drift rate.

	 Honeywll manufactures the modular azimuth and postioning
system (MAPS) and utilizes ring-laser gyros. (RLG). The RLG uses two
beams of laser light rotating in opposite directions along a path
within a sealed and enclosed cavity. As the unit changes heading, the
distances the beams travel differ. This difference is can be measured
and is directly related to heading. When combined with linear
accelerometers the unit provides position and orientation. MAPS has an

[10.1.3] Rangefinding devices

Principles
There are four basic techniques for distance measurement using electro
magetic radiation.

These are 
1 Pulse Timing
2 Phase Comparison
3 Doppler Methods
4 Interferometry 

All are used in practice for distance measurement depending on the
particular application.

Pulse timing, as the name suggests, involves measuring the round time
for a signal to be transmitted to a reflective surface and return.

This is the principle used in Radar, DME for aircraft, LORAN,
Satellite Altimetry, Airborne RADAR Altimetry, Lunar Laser Ranging
etc. Some of the newer EDM instruments used by surveyor are also using
pulse timing and accuracies of +/- 5mm are possible. Most of the
military range finders also use pulse timing.  The GPS system uses
pulse timing for coarse distance measurement.  Very Long Base
Interferometry (VLBI) is also a pulse timing technique where signals
&#62;from pulsars are timed from two or more radio telescopes and the
difference in times of arrival are converted to intercontinental
distances with a precision of a few centimetres.

Phase difference involves the use of a carrier wave which may be
modulated at different wavelengths. By measuring the difference in
phase between the transmitted signal and the received signal after it
has been reflected from the other end of the target, the distance can be
determined as an integer number (unknown) of wavelengths plus a
fraction of a wavelength which is known from the phase comparison. By
using a range of modulation frequencies the ambiguity can be
resolved. There are many applications of this technique. A wide range
of carrier frequencies are used ranging from visible through infra red
to microwave and right down to VLF. Typical instruments used by
surveyors have accuracies of +/-(1to2 mm +1to3 parts per million) and
use infra red as the carrier. Precise positioning using GPS can be
achieved by phase comparison of the carrier wave signals of the
various satellites. Accuracies in position of better than 1 part per
million can be achieved.

Doppler techniques were used in the earlier satellite positioning
systems. The received frequency of a low orbit satellite is compared
with the actual transmitted signal as a function of time. The rate of
change of frequency gives the slant range between the satellite and
the observer while the instant when the two freqencies are the same
gives the point of closest approach. By knowing the orbital parameters
of the satellite which are transmitted, the observers position can be
determined.

Interferometric methods are the same as those used in the original
Michelson Interferometer. It is used for metrology, high precision
distance measurement over short distances (up to 60 metres) and in the
definition of the metre.

	There are a variety of laser rangefinding devices that have
been built and used over the past decade for robotics use. The 3D
devices are still large, power hungry and heavy but give very nice
images suitable for fast map building and navigation work. Expect to
pay over $50K for these time-of-flight devices. Most AM Lidars measure
phase shift between outgoing and reflected beams.  A mirror system
rasters the beam forming a video-camera-like image. Some devices

	Laser Eye ranging system. It consists of a robotic head with a
combined vision / range sensor. The sensor provides colour images and
distance to an object in the centre of the camera field of view. There
is of course software to process images from the camera and detect a
target, to control the head, communication, nice GUIs, etc. Is being
used for vehicle navigation.

&#62;From the head position you get the bearing to the target and the
rangefinder provides you with the distance. Angular resolution is
better than 0.05 degree, the distance can be measured up to 100m with
accuracy of ~5 cm. Note that the range measurement is 1D along the
camera axis.

The cost of the vision system and complexity of the software depends
on your specific application: how difficult is it to detect and track
your vehicle, how fast is it moving, is it possible to use special
markers, is illumination constant, etc.

Force measurement provides indications of magnitude and direction of
forces for use in manipulation or locomotion. A variety of control
schemes have been implemented in force controlled systems to allow
smooth and accurate control in situations that would otherwise be
precluded without such devices. A number of load cells and
acceleration measuring devices are described here:

This section describes a simple addition to the drive circuitry, the
Polaroid ranging system can detect objects as close as 10cm.

The board has two extra signals: BLNK and BINH.  Asserting BLNK
(driving it HIGH) resets the ECHO RS-latch, and asserting BINH
shortens the internal blanking interval (which is 2.38 ms by default).
Thus, the solution would seem to lie in asserting BINH after a
reasonable amount of time (&#60; 2.38 ms after asserting INIT) to detect
objects closer than 1.3 feet.  This doesn't work very well because
BINH is very susceptable to noise, and attaching a driver to it wreaks
havoc possibly because of the anomalous current sink during the
transmit phase. This can be fixed by asserting BLNK during the
blanking period (ie the new blanking period) while negating BINH and
asserting BIHN after the blanking period while negating BLNK.  This
can be done easily with a one-shot or some other timing device (eg
computer timer, etc).

A computer timer can be used. The timer goes HIGH tblank ms after INIT
is asserted, where tblank=0.15*dist and dist is the threshold distance
in inches).  The timer output goes to BINH and the inverted timer
output goes to BLNK. The timer output should be inverted with an
LS/TTL inverter to delay the negation of BLNK, otherwise the RS latch
may do weird things.

   An all-electronic pan/tilt/zoom resampler. That is, they put a box
 behind a camera with a fish-eye lens. The box has digital inputs for
 pan, tilt, zoom, rotation. The box resamples the video signal and
 produces an output as though the image were acquired by a camera with
 those parameters. Used as an alternative to pan/tilt devices.

[10.1.7] Measuring robot position

How do I measure the postion of my arm/mobile robot/thing?

In many applications there is a need to accurately measure the
position of an end-effector (hand or gripper) or find coordinate
locations on objects, or track motion, or give a time and position
history of a moving object. Virtual reality applications need this
kind of device to provide realtime adjustments to views that are
projected to VR users. See news:sci.virtual-worlds for discussions on this
topic. Robotics people have needed this to provide accurate
assessments of manipulator motions and mobile robot positions.

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an excellent positioning system
that is useful in outdoor settings, although recent developments in
Psuedolites (Pseudo Satellities) may bring GPS technology indoors and
to urban envrionments. While accuracy is intentionally degraded by the
US Military recent advances in differential systems and innovative
tracking techniques can give 20cm real-time accuracy. Even newer
techniques such as carrier-phase are bringing this figure into the mm
range for real-time. See  news:sci.geo.satellite-nav for full
discussions of this technology.

	Intelligent Solutions Inc. was formed in Nov. of 1993 by four of the 
former engineers of Denning Mobile Robotics.  They are focusing on building 
smart sensors and their first product is the EZNav Position Sensor.
	EZNav is a precision optical position sensor that can be used
on moving platforms such as automated guided vehicles, robots, or
material handling equipment.  EZNav uses an eye safe scanning laser
with a 360 degree field of view to measure the azimuth angle to wall
mounted reference reflectors.  This angle data can be used to
triangulate the position and heading relative to the known target
locations.  EZNav is unique in its ability to use passive reflectors
as well as coded electronic targets. Current work includes adding
the triangulation calculations to the EZNav sensor and a new
Ultrasonic based position sensor.

Sensitivity to metal is claimed to be on the order 5 to 10 times less
than Polhemus tracker. Range and specifications are much better as
well.

The Ascension Flock of Birds tracker is DC pulsed, where the Polhemus
is AC magnetic field. The AC field set up standing waves in metal
(conduction and ferris) which magnify the distortion effect.

[10.2.1] RC-Servos

R/C servos for model airplanes, cars and other vehicles are light,
rugged, cheap and fairly easy to interface. For prices etc see one of
the many Radio Control magazines on the market.

Three wire connector for RC-servos:

Pin 1 = White = Signal
Pin 2 = Red   = +5
Pin 3 = Black = Signal and Power Ground
[Tang = pin 1]

The signal is a variable width pulse ranging from 1-2ms in duration
and repeating every 12-20 ms. The output shaft rotates to a position
porportional to the input pulse width. Input pulse width is compared
to an internal timer pulse. The timer period is controlled by a pot
coupled to the servo's output shaft. The difference between the two
pulse widths is an error signal. The servo attempts to reduce or
eliminate the error signal by driving the output shaft in the
appropriate direction. When the error signal is within about 5
micro-seconds the drivers are turned off to preventing oscillation or
'hunting'.

How to reverse a servo?

The easiest way to do this is to hit your R/C hobby shop and buy a
servo reverser.  This is a dedicated electronic module that plugs
between the servo and the controller (usually the R/C receiver) and
processes the pulse to "reverse" it.  Basically, the device uses a 3
msec one-shot and an XOR gate. If your local hobby shop doesn't have
them, check Ace R/C catalog. See ads in any R/C magazine.

A harder way is as follows.
You have to reverse both the motor and the potentiometer leads.

It would be much easier to reverse the control input. All modern
radios have "reverse" switches for all channels. In the past you
could have one of 3 solutions:
a. Live with the servo as-is. Design your model with the servo
   direction in mind.
b. Some companies had "reversed" servos. Probably no longer available.
c. Use a gadget between the receiver and radio that reverses
   the servo. Possibly a single 4538 (Motorola MC14538) with 2
   resistors, 3 capacitors and a trimmer pot.
d. Modify the servo. This is the most difficult and least desired
   solution. Impossible if the motor is soldered directly to the
   PCB (seen in some servos). [from Itai Nashon]

PIC-based circuit to control R/C Servos. (See the Microcontrollers

[10.2.2] Shape memory materials

 Nickel-titanium alloys were first discovered by the Naval Ordinance
 Laboratory decades ago and the material was termed NiTinOL. These
 materials have the intriguing property that they provide actuation
 through cycling of current through the materials. It undergoes a
 'phase change' exhibited as force and motion in the wire.

 Research into shape memory alloys, polymer gels and micromechanism
 devices is ongoing. Library browsing is a must to get recent
 information on these areas.

[10.2.3] Stepper Motor Controller

Wally Blackburn &#60;wrb@ccsitn.cs.att.com&#62; has provided a stepper motor
controller design that easily connects to a parallel port:

<A NAME=id3 HREF="ftp://ft.bode.ee.ulaberta.you/pub/cookbook/unsorted/pc_stepr.zip">ftp://ft.bode.ee.ulaberta.you/pub/cookbook/unsorted/pc_stepr.zip</A> 

This is the info file for the Opto-Isolated Stepper Motor Controller.
While the info is oriented towards control via a PC parallel port, the
controller can really interface to just about anything.

The controller uses a UCN5804B controller IC from Allegro.  This chip
can control motors at up to 35V and 1.25A continuously.  Peaks of up 
to 50V and 1.5A can be tolerated according to the data sheet.

The inputs to the UCN5804B are optically isolated from the control
circuitry.  Input control voltages from 3 to 12V are acceptable.
Diodes are used to protect the UCN5804B from negative transients from
the motor windings.  For efficient low-voltage operation, Schottky 
diodes are used.

	I have recently rewritten the instructions and included a
	simple parallel port control program in QuickBASIC.  The Turbo
	C source is still included also. I still have kits for the
	controller.

	Offers a modular vision system that can be taylored for the
application.  Both VME and PC ISA/VL-bus platforms are supported.  It
seems likely, however, that when all the required modules are
selected, the system will have a fairly large pricetag.

A system consists of an 'image manager' or IML which is either a VME
or PC ISA/VL-bus compatible board.  It contains some framstore memory
and a slot for the 'acquisition module'.  For the PC version, the IML
can be used as the system VGA adapter, eliminating the need for a
separate display card or module.  To add one of the many available
computational modules, the 'Computational Module Controller' or CML
must be purchased, which also plugs onto (sort of) the IML.  The CML
has slots for either one or two plug-on computational modules.  So, as
you can see, it adds up quick.  About $23k for a system with 2
C31 DSP computational modules.  Device drivers are available for
DOS/Windows, VxWorks, OS-9, and Solaris.

There are 4 available acquisition modules:
Variable Scan: interfaces to RS-170 and CCIR cameras
Fast Analog Acquisition:  interfaces to high frame rate analog cameras
Color Acquisition:  interfaces to NTSC, PAL, RGB or multiple RS-170/CCIR
  cameras.  One interesting feature of this module is the ability to program
  your own color space.  Otherwise, it supports HSI, YUV, YIQ and YCrCb
  color spaces.  
Digital Acquistion:  interfaces to RS-422 or TTL video sources.

There are 5 available computational modules:
Convolver/Arithmetic Logic Unit (CM-CLU):  Accelerates convolution. e.g.
  a 4x4 convolution on an 8-bit 512x512 image takes 7.5 ms. 
Programmable Accelerator (CM-PA):  Contains a TMS320C31 DSP from TI (which
  can be programmed in C), 4Mb image memory and 1Mb of EEPROM.
Histogram/Feature Extraction Processor (CM-HF):  Performs realtime histograms
 and feature detection.
Median and Morphological Processor (CM-MMP): performs morphological filtering,
  erosion, and dilation.
Binary Correlator (CM-BC):  Performs high-speed template matching and binary
  morphology.

  custom ASICS for fast data transfer, and a high resolution RGB display
  driver.  
IMAGE-ASD is a monochrome acquisition card that plugs into the ISA bus.
IMAGE-CLD is a color acquisition card that does realtime RGB to HSI conversion
  and also plugs into the ISA bus.
IMAGE-RTP performs a whole slew of processing functions using a bunch of
 ASICS (e.g. histograms, LaPlacians, morphologies, logical operators, erosion,
 dilation, centroids, pattern matching, more)
IMAGE-FPU accelerates large kernel convolutions and FFTs

Matrox also offers an extensive image processing library and utilities 
that run under Windows.

Irvine, CA 92714
714 261-6224
800 562-7427
714 261-9321 (fax)

The basic system that Sharp offers is the GPB-1
Input:      4 multiplexed RS-170 inputs 8 bit greyscale.  Optional 'Incard'
            allows 3 parallel camera inputs, or one RGB input, but occupies
            another ISA slot.
Memory:     12 512x512x8 bit framestores.   
Bus:        ISA
Processing: High-speed ASICS which perform convolution, histogram analysis, 
            feature extraction, connectivity analysis, more.  These operations
            all take place at 40 ns/pixel.  Thus, for example, a 3x3 
            convolution takes 12 ms for a 512x512x8 bit image.  Other 
            processing boards (see below) are available and external 
            interfaces are provided for the addition of a separate Alacron 
            i860 card with 80 Mflops of performance (available 2/95).    
Other:      VGA output for displaying images.  An optional 'Single monitor 
            adapter' acts as the system VGA adapter.
           
There are 3 function-specific computational cards that plug into the GPB-1:

Alignment card: performs normalized correlation with model data.
Auxlut card: has dual 64k 16 bit input 8 bit output lookup tables.
  A possible application would be RGB to HSI conversion.
Auxwarp Card: 'a pixel re-sampler that may be used to modify the 
  geometric shape of an object.'
Memory Mapping: Maps large amounts of image data to ISA bus and allows 
  random access of regions of interest, say.  Also it allows new GPB-1
  commands to be loaded in and ready to go while the GPB-1 is busy with 
  its current command.  Occupies a separate ISA slot.

Sharp also has available a Windows algorithm development tool which allows
the user to develop algorithms using interpreted scripts -- thus eliminating
the compiling step.  The scripts can then be converted to C-code and 
compiled, if appropriate.  Over 250 C-callable image processing functions are
provided.

The basic GPB-1 system costs $11,000.  A system with an Incard, and Auxlut
runs around $20,000.
