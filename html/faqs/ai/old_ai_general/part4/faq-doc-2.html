The lack of a review or the presence of a short review should not be
interpreted as indicating anything about the quality of the text.

Introductory texts:

   Elaine Rich &#38; Kevin Knight, "Artificial Intelligence", 2nd edition,
   McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-07-052263-4. [One of the more
   popular introductory texts to AI, giving a very good general
   overview of most AI topics. In some places the book sacrifices
   depth for breadth, and a few more recent topics are neglected.
   Nevertheless this book provides an excellent foundation in areas
   central to AI. Source code is available from

   Patrick Henry Winston, "Artificial Intelligence", Third Edition, 
   Addison Wesley, Reading, MA, 1992, ISBN 0-201-53377-4.
   [A classic early AI text. This text is very much hands-on, with
   actual toy examples. Source code is in <A NAME=id3 HREF="ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/ai3/.]">ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/ai3/.]</A>

   Matthew L. Ginsberg, "Essentials of AI", Morgan Kaufmann
   Publishers, 1993, ISBN 1-55860-221-6, 430 pages, $49.95. 
      [Topics include search, knowledge representation, logic,
      assumption-based truth maintenance, nonmonotonic reasoning,
      probability, frames, semantic nets, planning, learning, vision,
      natural language processing, and expert systems.]

   George Luger and William Stubblefield, "Artificial Intelligence:
   Structures and Strategies for Complex Problem Solving", 2nd
   Edition, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1993.
   720 pages, ISBN 0-8053-4780-1.
   [Includes algorithms implemented in Lisp and Prolog.]

   Ian Pratt, "Artificial Intelligence", Macmillan, London, 1994. 280
   pages, ISBN 0-333-59755-9 ($35). [In-depth introduction to several
   AI topics, using inference as a central theme. As a result, omits
   topics like NLP, expert systems, vision, and robotics. Hence this
   book is a good themed introduction to a subset of AI, but is not
   suitable for a general purpose overview of AI. Curiously, the book
   does include a chapter on neural networks which doesn't fit into
   the theme, in addition to chapters on planning, search, and other
   topics related to logic and reasoning. 
   The presentation is superb, doing an excellent job of conveying the
   essential insights behind the concepts, followed by the technical
   details and pseudocode for the algorithms. Very good use of diagrams
   to explain difficult concepts. Heavily dependent on predicate
   calculus, with a tutorial introduction in the appendix. Suitable
   for an advanced undergraduate/introductory masters-level course. A
   longer version of this review is available as
