<PRE>
First, ask your librarian for help. If your local library doesn't have it,
they may be able to get it on interlibrary loan.

If you want to buy your own copy, first check with the organization
that ran the conference. See part 3 of the AI FAQ for a list of many
of the AI organizations that sponsor conferences.

If they can't help you, contact the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), and look up the proceedings in their Index to Scientific and
Technical Proceedings (ISTP volumes). You can contact the ISI at

   Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.
   3501 Market Street
   Philadelphia, PA 19104
   Phone: 215-386-0100
   Fax: 215-386-6362
