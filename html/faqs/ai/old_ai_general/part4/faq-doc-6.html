<H1>[1d] Tech Reports, Abstracts, etc.</H1>
<PRE>
The easiest and cheapest way to get a copy of a tech report, paper, or
thesis is to send email to the author. Most researchers will be happy
to drop a copy of the report to you in the mail, or give you a pointer
to an online copy. In some cases they may direct you to a central
technical report coordinator for their department (see [6-2]), and
getting a copy may involve a nominal fee.

Scientific DataLink publishes AIDA (AI Database of Abstracts), a
CD-ROM of abstracts from AI technical reports on a subscription basis
with a new CD every 6 months. For more information, write to
Scientific DataLink, 270 Lafayette Street, Suite 704, New York, NY
10012, call 1-800-735-8655 or fax 212-966-3417. Ask
