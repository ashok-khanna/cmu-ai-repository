<PRE>
The Loebner Prize, based on a fund of over $100,000 established by New
York businessman Hugh G. Loebner, is awarded annually for the computer
program that best emulates natural human behavior. During the
contest, a panel of independent judges attempts to determine whether
the responses on a computer terminal are being produced by a computer
or a person, along the lines of the Turing Test. The designers of the
best program each year win a cash award and a medal. If a program
passes the test in all its particulars, then the entire fund will be
paid to the program's designer and the fund abolished. For further
information about the Loebner Prize, see the URL

The Gordon Bell Prize competition recognizes outstanding achievements
in the application of parallel processing to practical scientific and
engineering problems. Entries are considered in performance,
price/performance, compiler parallelization and speedup categories,
and a total of $3,000 will be awarded. The prizes are sponsored by
Gordon Bell, a former National Science Foundation division director
who is now an independent consultant.  Contestants should send a
three- or four-page executive summary to 1993 Gordon Bell Prize, 
c/o Marilyn Potes, IEEE Computer Society, 10662 Los Vaqueros Cir., 
PO Box 3014, Los Alamitos, CA 90720-1264, before May 31, 1993.

AAAI has an annual robot building competition.  The anonymous FTP site

   <A NAME=id25 HREF="ftp://aeneas.mit.edu/pub/ACS/6.270/AAAI/">aeneas.mit.edu:/pub/ACS/6.270/AAAI/</A>
This site has the manual and the rules.  To be added to the
rbl-94@ai.mit.edu mailing list for discussing the AAAI robot building
contest, send mail to rbl-94-request@ai.mit.edu. See also the 6.270
robot building guide in part 4 of this FAQ.

The International Computer Chess Association presents an annual prize
for the best computer-generated annotation of a chess game. The output
should be reminiscent of that appearing in newspaper chess columns,
and will be judged on both the correctness and depth of the variations
and also on the quality of the program's written output. The deadline
is December 31, 1994. For more information, write to Tony Marsland
&#60;tony@cs.ualberta.ca&#62;, ICCA President, Computing Science Department,
University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada T6G 2H1, call 403-492-3971, or
fax 403-492-1071.
