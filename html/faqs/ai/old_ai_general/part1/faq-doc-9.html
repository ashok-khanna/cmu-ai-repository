<H1>[1-8] AI Job Postings</H1>
<PRE>
The AI-Jobs mailing list exists to help programmers and researchers
find AI programming and research positions, and to help companies with
AI programming and research positions find capable AI programmers and
researchers.

Material appropriate for the list includes AI job announcements and
should be sent to ai+ai-jobs@cs.cmu.edu. Resumes should NOT be sent to
the list. 

As a matter of policy, the contents of this mailing list is
considered confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

To subscribe, send a message to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   subscribe ai-jobs &#60;First Name&#62; &#60;Last Name&#62;, &#60;Affiliation/Organization&#62;
in the message body and no Subject line. 

Similar lists exist for post-doctoral fellowships (subscribe to AI-POSTDOC),
pre-doctoral fellowships (subscribe to AI-PREDOC), Lisp jobs
(subscribe to Lisp-Jobs) and Prolog jobs (subscribe to Prolog-Jobs).

(If your mailer objects to the "+", send subscription requests to
"ai+query"@cs.cmu.edu, job announcements to "ai+ai-jobs"@cs.cmu.edu, etc.)

For help on using the query server, send mail to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   help
in the message body and no Subject line.

Job postings sent to the list are automatically archived in
appropriate subdirectories of
   <A NAME=id27 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/jobs/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/</A>
or on the AI-related Job Posting Archives web page
   <A NAME=id28 HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/other/jobs.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/other/jobs.html</A>

If you have any other questions, please send them to ai+@cs.cmu.edu

[For neural networks, the Neuron Digest and Connectionists mailing
lists are a good source of job postings. For computer vision, the
VISION-LIST digest includes occasional job announcements. A good
source for general AI is Computists' Communique. For postdoctoral
appointments, see sci.research.postdocs.]
