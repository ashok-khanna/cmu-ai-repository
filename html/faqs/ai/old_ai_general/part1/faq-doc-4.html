<H1>[1-3] What are the top schools in AI?</H1>
<PRE>
The answer to this question is not intended to be a ranking and should
not be interpreted as such. There are several major problems with
ratings like the Gourman Report and the US News and World Report. Such
rankings are often unsubstantiated and anecdotal, their accuracy is
questionable, and they do not focus on the subfields of an area. When
selecting a graduate school, students should look for schools which
not only have excellent programs in their general area of research
but also at least one faculty member whose research interests mesh
well with the student's. Accordingly, we've broken down this list
according to topic, and sorted the schools within each topic in
ALPHABETICAL ORDER. 

For a school to be added to a topic area, there should at least two
faculty actively conducting research in that area and the school
should have a "good" reputation in that area. Exceptions are made for
schools which only have one faculty member in the area, but that
professor is a "leader" of the area, or for fields where the total
number of people working in the area is small in the first place. The
general idea behind these criteria is to ensure that a school has
enough activity in the area that a student who considers one of these
schools won't be disappointed if one of the faculty in that area is on
sabbatical or isn't taking students. Note that the research need not
be conducted in the school's computer science department for the
school to be listed -- in some cases we've included schools where the
research is being conducted in a different department or special laboratory.

The best way for students to discover which schools are good in a
field is to ask professors (and graduate students) in their
undergraduate school for suggestions on where to apply. Reading the
research journals in the field is another good method (see part 3 of
the FAQ).

A genealogy of AI thesis-advising relationships is available by
anonymous ftp as 
   <A NAME=id18 HREF="ftp://cs.ucsd.edu/pub/rik/aigen.rpt">cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/aigen.rpt</A>
Although intended to complement citation analysis and free-text
information retrieval as tools for understanding the AI community and
their connections to other disciplines, it may be useful to
prospective graduate students. For example, it may help you understand
the historical context of a given professor's perspective.  2,600 MS
and PhD theses have been tabulated so far.  If you'd like to
contribute additional listings (including year, title, abstract,
school, advisor, committee members, and subsequent employment), write
to Rik Belew &#60;rik@cs.ucsd.edu&#62; or fax 619-534-7029, for the
questionnaire. A copy of the questionaire and more information is
available in 
   <A NAME=id19 HREF="ftp://cs.ucsd.edu/pub/rik/announce.t">cs.ucsd.edu:/pub/rik/announce.t</A>

A list of email addresses for CS departments is posted once a month to
the newsgroup soc.college.gradinfo.

The Association for Computational Linguistics publishes a directory of
graduate programs in Computational Linguistics ($15 for members, $30
for others). It includes several useful indices (e.g., index of
faculty and a list of references). Contact Association for
Computational Linguistics, Walker, C. N. 925, Bernardsville, NJ
07924-0925, phone/fax 908-204-1337, or send email to acl@bellcore.com.

NOTE THAT THIS LIST IS PRELIMINARY AND BY NO MEANS COMPLETE.
