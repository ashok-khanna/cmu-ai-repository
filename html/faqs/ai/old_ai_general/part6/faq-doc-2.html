AI: 

   The Computer Science Department at the University of Saarbruecken, Germany,
   maintains a large bibliographic database of articles pertaining to the
   field of Artificial Intelligence. Currently the database contains more
   than 25,000 references, which can be retrieved by electronic mail from
   the LIDO mailserver at lido@cs.uni-sb.de. Send a mail message with
   subject line "lidosearch help info" to get instructions on using the
   mail server. A variety of queries based on author names, title and
   year of publication are possible. The references can be provided in
   BibTeX or Refer formats. The entire bibliographic database can be
   obtained for a fee by ftp or on tape. Questions may be directed to
   bib-1@cs.uni-sb.de.
