HUMANIST:	[Mail from utorepas bounces. 8/18/93 mk]
   humanist%utorepas.bitnet@cornellc.ccs.cornell.edu

   HUMANIST is an international mailing list for discussion of
   applications of computers to scholarship in the humanities. AI
   or NLP topics sometimes come up.

   Interested individuals should send a note together with a brief
   biography to the Coordinator in the following format:

     *Family-name, Given-names &#60;e-mail address&#62;

     Title, mailing address(es), telephone number(s).

     Body of biography.  This should not be a c.v. and need not be very
     detailed but should cover the full range of your professional
     activities and interests, both present and past.  Mention other things
     at your discretion.  Biographies vary considerably in length, though
     few are less than 100 words or more than 500.

   Coordinator: 
     Willard McCarty &#60;mccarty%utorepas.bitnet@cornellc.ccs.cornell.edu&#62;
