Intelligent Systems for Business and Economics (IE-Digest):

   IE-list@cs.ucl.ac.uk

   The IE-digest aims to act as a forum to exchange ideas on using
   `intelligent' techniques to model economic and financial systems.
   Calls for papers, paper announcements and queries are welcome.

   Techniques which were originally developed to model psychological and
   biological processes are now receiving considerable attention as tools
   for modelling and understanding economic and financial processes.
   These techniques, which include neural networks, genetic algorithms
   and expert systems are now being used in a wide variety of
   applications including the modelling of economic cycles, modelling of
   artificial economies, portfolio optimisation and credit evaluation.

   To be added to the list, send mail to IE-list-request@cs.ucl.ac.uk. An
   archive of back issues of the digest, as well as papers,
   bibliographies and software, may be obtained by anonymous ftp from
   <A NAME=id29 HREF="ftp://cs.ucl.ac.uk/ie/">cs.ucl.ac.uk:/ie/</A> [128.16.5.31].
