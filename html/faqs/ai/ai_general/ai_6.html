   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600
   and higher, VAX Common Lisp, and MCL. The XGinseng interface is built
   on top of Garnet.  SNePS 2.1 is free according to the GNU General
   Public License version 2. The SNePS distribution is available by

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
   free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/

   The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a
   graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   PEBLS (Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System) is a nearest-neighbor
   learning system designed for applications where the instances have
   symbolic feature values.  PEBLS has been applied to the prediction of
   protein secondary structure and to the identification of DNA promoter
   sequences. PEBLS 3.0 is written in ANSI C and is available by
   anonymous ftp from blaze.cs.jhu.edu:/pub/pebls/pebls.tar.Z
   [128.220.13.50] for research purposes only. For more information,
   contact Steven Salzberg <salzberg@cs.jhu.edu>.

   OC1 (Oblique Classifier 1) is a multivariate decision tree induction
   system designed for applications where the instances have numeric
   feature values.  OC1 builds decision trees that contain linear
   combinations of one or more attributes at each internal node; these
   trees then partition the space of examples with both oblique and
   axis-parallel hyperplanes.  OC1 has been used for classification of
   data from several real world domains, such as astronomy and cancer
   diagnosis.  A technical decription of the algorithm can be found in
   the AAAI-93 paper by Sreerama K. Murthy, Simon Kasif, Steven Salzberg
   and Richard Beigel.  A postscript version of this paper is included in
   the distribution. OC1 is a written entirely in ANSI C. OC1 is
   available by anonymous ftp from  

      blaze.cs.jhu.edu:/pub/oc1/ [128.220.13.50]

   Set-Enumeration (SE) Trees for Induction/Classification. Significant
   research in Machine Learning, and in Statistics, has been devoted to
   the induction and use of decision trees as classifiers.  An induction
   framework which generalizes decision trees using a Set-Enumeration
   (SE) tree is outlined in  

      Rymon, R. (1993), An SE-tree-based Characterization of the Induction
      Problem. In Proc. of the Tenth International Conference on Machine
      Learning, Amherst MA, pp. 268-275.

   In this framework, called SE-Learn, rather than splitting according to
   a single attribute, one recursively branches on all (or most) relevant
   attributes. An induced SE-tree can be shown to economically embed many
   decision trees, thereby supporting a more expressive hypothesis
   representation. Also, by branching on many attributes, SE-Learn
   removes much of the algorithm-dependent search bias. Implementations
   of SE-Learn can benefit from many techniques developed for decision
   trees (e.g., attribute-selection and pruning measures). In particular,
   SE-Learn can be tailored to start off with one's favorite decision
   tree, and then improve upon it by further exploring the SE-tree. This
   hill-climbing algorithm allows trading time/space for added accuracy.
   Current studies (yet unpublished) show that SE-trees are particularly
   advantageous in domains where (relatively) few examples are available
   for training, and in noisy domains. Finally, SE-trees can provide a
   unified framework for combining induced knowledge with knowledge
   available from other sources (Rymon, 1994).

      Proc. of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
      Seattle WA.

   A Lisp implementation of SE-Learn is available from Ron Rymon
   <Rymon@ISP.Pitt.edu>. A commercial version in C is currently under

   MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
   environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
   oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
   with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
   oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
   and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
   architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
   continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
   supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
   weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
   can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
   support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
   and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
   non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. _
   MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
   University Electrical Engineering. The software is written in 'C' and
   is being used on Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to
   port it to the Fujitsu VP2200 vector processor using the VCC
   vectorising C compiler, HP 9000/700, SGI workstations, DEC
   Alphas, and PC DOS (with DJGCC). MUME is available to research
   institutions on a media/doc/postage cost arrangement after
   signing a license agreement. The license agreement is available by

   ToolDiag
   ToolDiag is a feature selection program that increases the accuracy of
   classifiers and reduces their complexity by providing them with a
   subset containing only the most relevant features. It has interfaces
   to LVQ_PAK and SNNS, and uses a data file format that is compatible
   with that of LVQ_PAK. The 2-d graphics can be displayed using the
   GNUPLOT plotting package. ToolDiag implements many concepts from
   Devijver and Kittler's book "Pattern Recognition -- A Statistical
   Approach" (Prentice Hall, 1982), including the optimal branch and
   bound search strategy, together with several different selection
   criteria. ToolDiag can also perform an error estimation using the
   leave-one-out method and a K-nearest-neighbor classifier. It also
   includes a learning module (Q*) that has the same functionality as
   LVQ. ToolDiag cannot handle missing values and requires continuous or
   ordered discrete numerical features. ToolDiag is implemented in C and
   documentation and source code are available by anonymous ftp from

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The Animator, developed by Lori Pratt and Steve Nicodemus
   of the Colorado School of Mines, uses the Motif toolkit on an IBM
   RS6000 with X-Windows.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.  The animator is available by
   anonymous ftp from

      mines.colorado.edu:/pub/software/hyperplane-animator/ [138.67.1.3]

   as the file hyperplane-animator.tar. An openwindows version of the
   animator is available by anonymous ftp from

   SUZY is a simple neural net classifier system for PCs written in C++
   and Turbo Vision. RBFs are used to implement the classifier system
   with a class-based algorithm being applied to find the centres and
   radii of the RBS units. The program is not intended for any serious
   applications and is quite slow, but may be of interest to some people.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from

      rhino.cis.vutbr.cz:/pub/software/ai/suzy.tar.Z [147.229.3.10]

   For further information, contact tgrove@psycho.fme.vutbr.cz.

   MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is an efficient implementation of the
   back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.  The
   algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
   descent.  All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
   and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
   peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
   caches.  On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x speed-up
   can be measured respect to conventional implementations.  
   The software is available by anonymous ftp from

      risc6000.dibe.unige.it:/pub/ [130.251.89.154]

Neural Systems (Biological Simulation):

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  It is in the public domain and runs on Unix workstations
   (a less-powerful PC version is also available). BIOSIM includes a
   graphical user interface and was designed for research and teaching.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.uni-kl.de:/pub/bio/neurobio [131.246.9.95]

   For more information, write to Stefan Bergdoll <bergdoll@zxa.basf-ag.de>.

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  GENESIS and its graphical front-end
   XODUS are written in C and run on SUN and DEC graphics work stations
   under UNIX (Sun version 4.0 and up, Ultrix 3.1, 4.0 and up), and
   X-windows (versions X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5).  The current version of
   GENESIS has also been used with Silicon Graphics (Irix 4.0.1 and up)
   and the HP 700 series (HPUX).  The distribution includes full source
   code and documentation for both GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen
   demonstration and tutorial simulations.  Documentation for these
   simulations is included, along with three papers that describe the
   general organization of the simulator.  GENESIS is available by
   anonymous ftp from genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.137.64). Before
   using ftp, you must telnet to genesis.cns.caltech.edu and login as the
   user "genesis" (no password required) to register.  If you answer all
   the questions asked of you an 'ftp' account will automatically be
   created for you.  You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download
   the software.  Further inquiries concerning GENESIS may be addressed
   to genesis@cns.caltech.edu.

   The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
   includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
   interface to the X window system. ARS MAGNA can be obtained by
   anonymous ftp from 

      ftp.cs.yale.edu:/pub/nisp 

   as the file ars-magna.tar.Z. Installation instructions are in the file
   Installation.readme. The simulator is written in Nisp, a macro-package
   for Common Lisp. Nisp can be retrieved in the same way as the
   simulator. Version 1.0 of the ARS MAGNA simulator is documented in
   Yale Technical Report YALEU/DCS/RR #928, "ARS MAGNA: The Abstract
   Robot Simulator". This report is available in the distribution as a

   The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is a
   tool for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems
   under a variety of conditions.  MICE simulates a two-dimensional
   grid-world in which agents may move, communicate, and affect their
   environment.  MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that
   helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides
   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain
   and its properties, etc.  MICE runs under XWindows on Un*x boxes, on
   Macs, and on TI Explorers, with relatively consistent graphical
   displays.  Source code, documentation, and examples are available via
   anonymous ftp to ftp.eecs.umich.edu:/software/Mice/Mice.tar.Z.  MICE was
   produced by the University of Michigan's Distributed Intelligent Agent
   Group (UM DIAG).  For further information, write to

   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
   (the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
   X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
   multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot.  CONNEL is the
   controller, which must be designed by the user (in the distributed
   version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.)  The programs
   use Unix sockets for communication, so you must have sockets, but you
   can run the programs on different machines.  The software is available
   by anonymous ftp from

      galba.mbfys.kun.nl:/pub/neuro-software/pd/ [131.174.82.73]

   as the file simderella.2.0.tar.gz. The software has been compiled using

   systems. Most current copies can be obtained by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.alumni.caltech.edu:/pub/ingber/ASA.tar.gz [131.215.48.62]

   an uncompressed version, asa, also is in that archive.  There are several
   related (p)reprints in the Caltech archive, including sa_pvt93.ps.Z,
   "Simulated annealing: Practice versus theory." The first VFSR code was
   developed by Lester Ingber in 1987, and the reprint of that paper is
   vfsr89.ps.Z, "Very fast simulated re-annealing".  If you cannot use
   ftp or ftpmail, then copies of the code are also available by email
   from the author at ingber@alumni.caltech.edu. To be added to the
   mailing list, send mail to asa-request@alumni.caltech.edu.

   The VFSR code was made publicly available in 1992 under the GNU GPL, by
   Lester Ingber and Bruce Rosen.  The last version of that code before
   the introduction of ASA is available via anonymous ftp from

   The OGI Speech Tools are set of speech data manipulation tools
   developed at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU) at
   the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (Portland
   Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and display signal
   representations, label speech at different levels (e.g., phonetic,
   phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers, and display the
   output of classification or recognition algorithms time-aligned with
   the speech. The OGI Speech Tools were written in ANSI C.  The OGI
   Speech Tools are available by anonymous ftp from

      speech.cse.ogi.edu:/pub/tools/ 

   as ogitools.v1.0.tar.Z. For more information, write to Johan Schalkwyk
   <tools@cse.ogi.edu>. If you're using the tools, please let Johan know
   by sending him a mail message.

   TimeGraph-- Metric and Qualitative temporal reasoning system which
               handles (<, =, >) point relations, bounds on absolute
               calendar/clock times, and bounds on durations. Data entry
               and retrieval is through interval or point relations.
               The system is scalable in the sense that storage
               remains linear in the number of relations added.
               Efficient retrieval is achieved through a simple 
               timepoint numbering scheme and metagraph structure.
               See SIGART Bulletin 4 (3), pp. 21-25, July 1993.

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point
   Algebra and of the Pointizable Interval Algebra (also called Simple
   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure. TG-II is written in Common Lisp.  For a description of the
   theory underlying the system see:

	  Reasoning through Timegraphs", in Proceedings of IJCAI-93.

   TimeLogic-- The TimeLogic system is an interval-based forward
               chaining inference engine and database manager of
               temporal constraints.  Relational constraints,
               indicating relative order between intervals, are based
               on Allen's interval logic.  The TimeLogic system also
               supports durational constraints, indicating relative
               magnitude between intervals, and reference links, used
               for the explicit or automatic construction of interval
               hierarchies.  Constraints are posed and propagated in
               user-defined contexts with inheritance. Supports relative
               metric constraints but no absolute dates or times.
               Written in Common Lisp.

   TCNM (Temporal Constraint Network Manager) manages non-disjunctive
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations in an integrated
   way. These constraints allow us express absolute, qualitative and
   metric constraints on time-points and on durations, which are managed
   in an integrated way. In the updating processes, a non-redundant and
   global consistent Temporal Constraint Network is always maintained by
   means of an efficient and complete propagation method, with a O(n**2)
   temporal complexity. Sound and complete retrieval processes have a
   constant cost. Written in Common Lisp.  For more information, contact
   Federico A. Barber <fbarber@dsic.upv.es>.  See also SIGART Bulletin

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.
   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. KEIM also provides
   functionality for the pretty-printing, error handling, formula parsing
   and user interface facilities which form a large part of any theorem
   prover. Implementing with KEIM thus allows the programmer to avoid a
   great deal of drudgery.  KEIM has been tested in Allegro CL 4.1 and
   Lucid CL 4.0 on Sun 4 workstations.  KEIM is available for
   noncommercial use via anonymous FTP from

      js-sfbsun.cs.uni-sb.de:/pub/keim/keim*
