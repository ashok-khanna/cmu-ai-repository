AI: 

   The Computer Science Department at the University of Saarbruecken, Germany,
   maintains a large bibliographic database of articles pertaining to the
   field of Artificial Intelligence. Currently the database contains more
   than 25,000 references, which can be retrieved by electronic mail from
   the LIDO mailserver at lido@cs.uni-sb.de. Send a mail message with
   subject line "lidosearch help info" to get instructions on using the
   mail server. A variety of queries based on author names, title and
   year of publication are possible. The references can be provided in
   BibTeX or Refer formats. The entire bibliographic database can be
   obtained for a fee by ftp or on tape. Questions may be directed to
   bib-1@cs.uni-sb.de.

Subject: [7-2] Technical Reports available by FTP

This section lists the anonymous ftp sites for technical reports from
several universities and other organizations. Some of the sites
provide only an online catalog of technical reports, while the rest
make the actual reports available online. The email address listed is
that of the appropriate person to contact with questions about
ordering technical reports. 

When ftping compressed .Z files, remember to set the transfer type to
binary first, using the command
        ftp> binary

Other general locations for technical reports from several
universities include:

   wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/techreports/ [128.252.135.4]
   cs-archive.uwaterloo.ca:/cs-archive/  (see Index for an index)
      AKA watdragon.uwaterloo.ca [129.97.140.24]

The uwaterloo archive includes tech reports from the Logic Programming
and Artificial Intelligence Group (LPAIG) of the University of Waterloo.

There is also a WAIS server containing tech report abstracts that can be
searched. To use, create the file ~/wais-sources/cs-techreport-abstracts.src 
containing
   (:source
      :version  3
      :ip-address "130.194.74.201"
      :ip-name "daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au"
      :tcp-port 210
      :database-name "cs-techreport-abstracts"
      :cost 0.00
      :cost-unit :free
      :maintainer "wais@daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au")
and invoke your local wais client. To add to it, email abstracts of
your papers to wais@rdt.monash.edu.au in the following format:
   %TI Title
   %AU Author (use multiple %AU lines for multiple authors)
   %PU Published In (citation information)
   %AV Availability (e.g., ftp reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu:/1992/CMU-CS-92-101.ps)
   %OR Organization (see cs-techreport-archives.src for institution codes)
   %LT Local title (e.g., tech report number)
   %DA Date (and, if you want, %MN Month, %YR Year)
   %AB Abstract
If your papers are not available by FTP, you can use a %AV line such as:
   %AV mail harry.bovik@cs.cmu.edu
Further instructions are available from
   daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au:/pub/techreports/reports/README  
[Based on a post by Ashwin Ram.]

An archive of linguistics papers and preprints is available from
linguistics.archive.umich.edu:/linguistics/papers/. Contact John Lawler
(jlawler@umich.edu) or linguistics-archivist@umich.edu for more
information.

The Concurrent Engineering Research Center (CERC) at West Virginia
University has placed ASCII versions of the concurrent
engineering-related abstracts (over 500) that were on CERCnet, ASCII
back issues of the Concurrent Engineering Research in Review journal
(now discontinued), and Postscript copies of CERC technical reports in
the gopher server gopher.cerc.wvu.edu.  In addition, many of the CERC
technical reports, including journal articles, symposium papers,
theses, dissertations, and issues of the Concurrent Engineering
Research in Review journal, are available as Postscript versions via
anonymous ftp from 

   babcock.cerc.wvu.edu:/pub/techReports/ [157.182.44.36]

An index to all the reports, including some that are
available only in hardcopy, is contained in the file "CERC-TR-INDEX".
If you need additional information, contact Mary Carriger, CERC Office
of Information Services, at carriger@cerc.wvu.edu.

The newsgroup comp.doc.techreports is devoted to distributing lists of

Subject: [7-3] Where can I get a machine readable dictionary, thesaurus, and
               other text corpora?

Free:

   /usr/dict/words

   Roget's 1911 Thesaurus is available by anonymous FTP from the
   Consortium for Lexical Research 

      clr.nmsu.edu:/CLR/lexica/roget-1911 [128.123.1.12]

   It is also available from

      src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/literary/collections/project_gutenberg/roget11.txt.Z

   An old Webster's dictionary is in /text/dict/{DICT.Z,DICT.INDEX.Z}.
   Project Gutenberg also has Roget's 1911 Thesaurus. The Project
   Gutenberg archive is at mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu:/pub/etext/. The
   Project Gutenberg archive collects public domain electronic books. For more
   information, write to Michael S. Hart, Professor of Electronic Text,
   Executive Director of Project Gutenberg Etext, Illinois Benedictine
   College, 5700 College Road, Lisle, IL 60532 or send email to
   hart@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu. 

   For people without FTP, Austin Code Works sells floppy disks
   containing Roget's 1911 Thesaurus for $40.00. This money helps support
   the production of other useful texts, such as the 1913 Webster's dictionary.

   The Online Book Initiative maintains a text repository on
   ftp.std.com (a public access UNIX system, 617-739-WRLD). See the
   README file on obi.std.com:/obi/. For more information, send email to
   obi@world.std.com, write to Software Tool & Die, 1330 Beacon Street,
   Brookline, MA 02146, or call 617-739-0202.

   The CHILDES project at Carnegie Mellon University has a lot of data of
   children speaking to adults, as well as the adult written and adult
   spoken corpora from the CORNELL project.  Contact Brian MacWhinney

   A list of 110,000 English words (one per line, in ASCII) is
   available in the PD1:<MSDOS.LINGUISTICS> directory on SIMTEL20 as the
   files WORDS1.ZIP, WORDS2.ZIP, WORDS3.ZIP, and WORDS4.ZIP. Although the
   list is in MS-DOS files, it can easily be used on other machines (but
   first you'll have to unzip the files on a DOS machine). The list
   includes inflected forms of the words, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed, and -ing forms of verbs; thus the number of lexical stems in
   the list is considerably smaller than the total number of word forms.
   These files are available via FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
   [192.88.110.20].  SIMTEL20 files are mirrored on wuarchive.wustl.edu.

Subject: [7-5] AI-related CD-ROMs

Prime Time Freeware for AI:

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is an annual CD-ROM collection of
   Artificial Intelligence freeware source code and documentation. Prime
   Time Freeware for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions on any
   package it includes.  Each issue consists of two ISO-9660 CD-ROMs,
   bound into a 224 page book.

   The current issue (1-1; July 1994) includes a selection of the
   contents of the CMU AI Repository (see [5-1]), including most of the
   AI Programming Languages section and most of the AI Software Packages
   section. Thus the CD-ROMs contain nearly every free implementation of
   Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, and Smalltalk, including graphical user
   interfaces, object-oriented programming extensions, and other software
   development tools.
		      
   They also contain the most complete collection of free software in 
   every area of artificial intelligence research and practice, including 
   Artificial Life, Expert Systems, Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms,
   Knowledge Representation, Machine Learning, Natural Language 
   Understanding and Generation, Neural Networks, Planning, Reasoning, 
   Speech Recognition and Synthesis, and Theorem Proving, and much, much more.
				 
   All of the more than 1,300 packages are extensively annotated and
   indexed, with programs for searching the index included on the CDs.
   Since the CD-ROMs use gzip for compression, this means that Prime
   Time Freeware for AI contains more than 5,000 megabytes of
   AI-related software.  

   Prime Time Freeware for AI is targeted at AI researchers, educators,
   students, and practitioners.  Prime Time Freeware for AI is
   particularly useful for programmers who do not have FTP access, but
   may also be useful as a way of saving disk space and avoiding annoying
   FTP searches and retrievals.
				
   Prime Time Freeware helped establish the CMU AI Repository, and sales
   of Prime Time Freeware for AI will continue to help support the
   expansion and maintenance of the repository. The product sells (list)
   for $60 US plus applicable sales tax and shipping and handling
   charges. Payable through Visa, Mastercard, postal money orders in US
   funds, and checks in US funds drawn on a US bank. Thus Prime Time
   Freeware for AI offers more than twice the contents of the NCC AI
   CD-ROM. For more information write to

   contains a variety of public domain, shareware, and other software of
   special interest to the AI community. The disk contains source code,
   executable programs, demonstration versions of commercial programs, 
   tutorials and other files for a variety of operating systems. Among the
   supported operating systems are DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and Unix. Among
   the items included are the latest version NASA software such as CLIPS v6,
   NETS, and SPLICER, the collected source code from AIExpert magazine from
   the premier issue in June of 1986 to the present, and complete 
   transcriptions of the first annual Loebner Prize competition. It also
   includes examples many different kinds of neural networks, genetic
   algorithms, artificial life simulators, natural language software,
   public domain and shareware compilers for a wide range of languages
   such as Lisp, Xlisp, Scheme, XScheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, ICON, SNOBOL,
   and many others. Complete collections of the Neural Digest, Genetic
   Algorithms Digest, and Vision List Digest are included. Most files on
   the disk are compressed in ZIP format. Macintosh specific files are 
   in BinHex v4 (.HQX) format. Network Cybernetics Corporation releases annual
   revisions to the AI CD-ROM to keep it up to date with current developments
   in the field. For more information, write to Network Cybernetics
   Corporation, 4201 Wingren Road, Suite 202, Irving, Texas 75062-2763, call

Subject: [7-6] World-Wide Web (WWW) Resources

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a hypermedia document that spans the
Internet.  It uses the http (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for the
light-weight exchange of files over the Internet.  NCSA Mosaic is a
World Wide Web browser developed at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). 

Mosaic's popularity derives, in part, from its ability to communicate
using more traditional Internet protocols like FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and
NNTP, in addition to http. Mosaic can display text, hypertext links,
and inlined graphics directly. When Mosaic encounters a file type it
can't handle internally, such as Postscript documents, mpeg movies,
sound files, and JPEG images, it uses an external viewer (or player)
like Ghostscript to handle the file. Mosaic also includes facilities
for exploring the Internet. In other words, Mosaic is an multimedia
interface to the Internet.

The hypertext documents viewed with Mosaic are written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language), which is a subset of SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language).  All that is needed is just a few more
improvements, such as the ability to format tables and mathematics,
and a WYSIWYG editor, for HTML to greatly facilitate electronic
journals and other publications.

NCSA Mosaic for the X Window System is available by anonymous ftp from  

   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/Mosaic/

as source code and binaries for Sun, SGI, IBM RS/6000, DEC Alpha OSF/1, DEC
Ultrix, and HP-UX. Questions about NCSA Mosaic should be directed to 
mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu (X-Windows version), mosaic-mac@ncsa.uiuc.edu
(Macintosh), and mosaic-win@ncsa.uiuc.edu (Microsoft Windows).

If you do not have a WWW client like Mosaic, you can search the WWW by
telnet to info.cern.ch. There is also an email interface; to use it,
send mail to listproc@www-0.cern.ch, and use lines like

   www http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/faqs/top.html

to retrieve the text of a particular URL (in this case, the AI FAQs page).

The remainder of this section lists WWW resources of interest to AI
researchers, students, and practitioners. Other URLs are scattered
throughout the FAQ. If the entry includes an email address, that is
the email address to which suggestions for additional links should be
sent. 

AI-related FAQ Postings:

   A simple HTML version of the AI FAQ (this FAQ) and several other
   AI-related FAQs is available as

   in the creation of the next generation. After about a dozen or so
   generations, really pretty pictures result.
