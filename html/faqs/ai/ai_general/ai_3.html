JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH (JAIR)
  JAIR is a refereed publication, covering all areas of AI, that is
distributed free of charge over the internet by WWW, ftp, electronic mail,
gopher, and the newsgroups comp.ai.jair.announce (announcements and
abstracts of new papers) and comp.ai.jair.papers (papers, code, and other
materials, distinguished by subject line). In addition, each complete
volume of JAIR is published by Morgan Kaufmann.
   Submissions in all areas of AI are invited. Papers should
describe work that has both practical and theoretical significance.
Only papers of the highest quality will be accepted. JAIR aims for
a review turn-around time of about 7 weeks, with electronic publication
occurring immediately after the editor receives the final version of an
accepted article.
  JAIR can be accessed by via the World Wide Web using the URL
