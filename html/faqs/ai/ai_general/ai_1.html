*** Introduction:

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Artificial Intelligence
(AI).  This file/article is an attempt to gather these questions and
their answers into a convenient reference for AI researchers. It is
posted on a monthly basis. The hope is that this will cut down on the
user time and network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the
same questions over and over, as well as providing education by
answering questions some readers may not even have thought to ask.

The latest version of this FAQ is available via anonymous FTP from 

   ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/AI/

as the files ai_[1-7].faq.


The FAQ postings are also archived in the periodic posting archive on

   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/general/ [18.181.0.24]

If you do not have anonymous ftp access, you can access the archive by
mail server as well.  Send an E-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

Subject: [1-0] What is the purpose of the newsgroup comp.ai?

Comp.ai is a moderated newsgroup whose topic is Artificial Intelligence.
It has existed since the early days of USENET (at least 10 years) and
has been a moderated newsgroup since 5th May 1999.  An introduction for 
new readers including the official charter, moderation policies and
posting guidelines may be found at <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~dnk/comp.ai>.
The current moderator is David Kinny, but the actual moderation is done
largely automatically by an intelligent :-) agent (the AI-mod-bot).
 
The group is meant for general discussion of AI topics (but not about
those for which specialized subgroups already exist), including:
 
o  announcements of AI conferences, reports, books, products and jobs.
o  questions and discussion about AI theory and practice, algorithms,
     systems and applications, problems, history and future trends.
o  distribution of AI source code (preferably indirectly by weblinks)
 
All contributions should be of potential interest to the general AI 
community, and in English plain text without attachments.  See part 2 
of this FAQ for a list of other more specialized newsgroups and lists.

Every so often, somebody posts an inflammatory message, such as

   Will computers every really think?
   AI hasn't done anything worthwhile.

These "religious" issues serve no real purpose other than to waste
bandwidth. If you feel the urge to respond to such a post, please do
so through a private e-mail message, or post redirecting follow-ups to
comp.ai.philosophy.  We suspect this will be less of a problem now
that the group is moderated.

We've tried to minimize the overlap with the FAQ postings to the
comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.prolog, comp.ai.neural-nets, and
comp.ai.shells newsgroups, so if you don't find what you're looking
for here, we suggest you try the FAQs for those newsgroups. These FAQs
should be available by anonymous ftp in subdirectories of

   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/

or by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with subject "help".

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-1] What is AI?

Artificial intelligence ("AI") can mean many things to many people.
Much confusion arises that the word 'intelligence' is ill-defined.
The phrase is so broad that people have found it useful to divide AI
into two classes: strong AI and weak AI.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-2] What's the difference between strong AI and weak AI?

Strong AI makes the bold claim that computers can be made to think on
a level (at least) equal to humans.  Weak AI simply states that some
"thinking-like" features can be added to computers to make them more
useful tools... and this has already started to happen (witness expert
systems, drive-by-wire cars and speech recognition software).  What
does 'think' and 'thinking-like' mean?  That's a matter of much
debate. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-3] I'm a programmer interested in AI.  Where do I start?

There's a list of introductory AI texts in the bibliography section
of the FAQ [4-0].

  [1-3a] I'm writing a game that needs AI.
  
  It depends what the game does.  If it's a two-player board game,
  look into the "Mini-max" search algorithm for games (see [4-1]).  In
  most commercial games, the AI is is a combination of high-level
  scripts and low-level efficiently-coded, real-time, rule-bsed
  systems.

Subject: [1-5] What has AI accomplished?

Quite a bit, actually.  In 'Computing machinery and intelligence.',
Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science, made the claim
that by the year 2000, computers would be able to pass the Turing test
at a reasonably sophisticated level, in particular, that the average
interrogator would not be able to identify the computer correctly more
than 70 per cent of the time after a five minute conversation.  AI
hasn't quite lived upto Turing's claims, but quite a bit of progress
has been made, including:

- Deployed speech dialog systems by firms like IBM, Dragon and Lernout&Hauspie

- Applications of expert systems/case-based reasoning: a computerized Lukemia
  diagnosis system did a better job checking for blood disorders than human
  experts!

- Machine translation for Environment Canada: software developed in the 1970s
  translated natural language weather forcasts between English and French.
  Purportedly stil in use.

- Deep Blue, the first computer to beat the human chess Grandmaster

- Fuzzy controllers in dishwashers, etc.

One persistent 'problem' is that as soon as an AI technique trully
succeeds, in the minds of many it ceases to be AI, becoming something
else entirely.  For example, when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov, there
were many who said Deep Blue wasn't AI, since after all it was just a
brute force parallel minimax search (!)

Subject: [1-6] What are the branches of AI?

There are many, some are 'problems' and some are 'techniques'.

    Automatic Programming - The task of describing what a program
        should do and having the AI system 'write' the program.

    Bayesian Networks - A technique of structuring and inferencing
        with probabilistic information.

    Natural Language Processing(NLP) - Processing and (perhaps)
        understanding human ("natural") language

    Knowledge Engineering/Representation - turning what we know about
	a particular domain into a form in which a computer can
	understand it. 

    Planning - given a set of actions, a goal state, and a present state,
	decide which actions must be taken so that the present state
	is turned into the goal state

    Constraint Statisfaction - solving NP-complete problems, using a
        variety of techniques.

    Machine Learning - Programs that learn from experience.

    Visual Pattern Recognition - The ability to reproduce the
	human sense of sight on a machine.

    Speech Recogntion - Conversion of speech into text.

    Search - The finding of a path from a start state to a goal
        state. Similar to planning, yet different...

    Neural Networks(NN) - The study of programs that function in a
        manner similar to how animal brains do.

AI problems (speech recognition, NLP, vision, automatic programming,
knowledge representation, etc.) can be paired with techniques (NN,
search, Bayesian nets, production systems, etc.)  to make distinctions
such as search-based NLP vs. NN NLP vs. Statistical/Probabilistic NLP.
Then you can combine techniques, such as using neural networks to
guide search.  And you can combine problems, such as posing that
knowledge representation and language are equivalent.  (Or you can
combine AI with problems from other domains.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-7] What are good programming languages for AI?

This topic can be somewhat sensitive, so I'll probably tread of a few
toes, please forgive me.  There is no authoritative answer for this
question, as it really depends on what languages you like programming
in.  AI programs have been written in just about every language ever
created.  The most common seem to be Lisp, Prolog, C, and recently
Java.

LISP- For many years, AI was done as research in universities and
laboratories, thus fast prototyping was favored over fast execution.
This is one reason why AI has favored high-level langauges such as
Lisp.  This tradition means that current AI Lisp programmers can draw
on many resources from the community.  Features of the language that
are good for AI programming include: garbage collection, dynamic
typing, functions as data, uniform syntax, interactive environment,
and extensibility.

PROLOG- This language wins 'cool idea' competition.  It wasn't until
the 70s that people began to realize that a set of logical statements
plus a general theorem prover could make up a program.  Prolog
combines the high-level and tradition advantages of Lisp with a
built-in unifier, which is particularly useful in AI.  Prolog seems to
be good for problems in which logic is intimately involved, or whose
solutions have a succinct logical characterization.  Its major
drawback (IMHO) is it is hard to learn.

C- The speed demon of the bunch, C is mostly used when the program is
simple, and excecution speed is the most important.  Neural Networks
are a common example of this.  Backpropagation is only a couple of
pages of C code, and needs every ounce of speed that the programmer
can muster. 

Java- The newcomer, Java uses several ideas from Lisp, most notably
garbage collection.  Its portability makes it desirable for just about
any application, and it has a decent set of built in types.  Java is
still not as high-level as Lisp or Prolog, and not as fast as C,
making it best when portability is paramount.

(some of the above material is due to the comp.lang.prolog FAQ, and
Norvig's "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case
Studies in Common Lisp")

Subject: [1-8] Glossary of AI terms.

This is the start of a simple glossary of short definitions for AI
terminology.  The purpose is not to present the gorey details, but
give ageneral idea.

   A*:
	A search algorithm to find the shortest path through a search
	space to a goal state using a heuristic.  See 'search',
	'problem space', 'Admissibility', and 'heuristic'.

   Admissibility:
        An admissible search algorithm is one that is guaranteed to
        find an optimal path from the start node to a goal node, if
        one exists. In A* search, an admissible heuristic is one that never
        overestimates the distance remaining from the current node to
        the goal. 

   Agent:
	"Anything that can can be viewed a perceiving its environment
	through sensors and acting upon that environment through
	effectors." [Russel, Norvig 1995]

   ai:
        A three-toed sloth of genus Bradypus. This forest-dwelling
        animal eats the leaves of the trumpet-tree and sounds a
        high-pitched squeal when disturbed. (Based on the Random House
        dictionary definition.)

   Alpha-Beta Pruning:
        A method of limiting search in the MiniMax algorithm.  The
        coolest thing you learn in an undergraduate course.

   Backward Chaining:
	In a logic system, reasoning from a query to the data.  See
	Forward chaining.

   Belief Network (also Bayesian Network):
	A mechanism for representing probabilistic knowledge.
	Inference algorithms in belief networks use the structure of
	the network to generate inferences effeciently (compared to
	joint probability distributions over all the variables).

   Breadth-first Search:
	An uninformed search algorithm where the shallowest node in
	the search tree is expanded first.

   Case-based Reasoning: 
        Technique whereby "cases" similar to the current problem are
        retrieved and their "solutions" modified to work on the current
        problem. 

   Closed World Assumption:
	The assumption that if a system has no knowledge about a
	query, it is false.

   Data Mining:
	Also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) was been defined
	as "The nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and
	potentially useful information from data" in Frawley and
	Piatetsky-Shapiro's overview.  It uses machine learning, statistical
	and visualization techniques to discover and present knowledge in a
	form which is easily comprehensible to humans.

   Depth-first Search
	An uninformed search algorithm, where the deepest non-terminal
	node is expanded first.

   Evaluation Function:
	A function applied to a game state to generate a guess as to
	who is winning.  Used by Minimax when the game tree is too
	large to be searched exhaustively.

   Forward Chaining:
	In a logic system, reasoning from facts to conclusions.  See
	Backward Chaining
 
   Fuzzy Logic:
        In Fuzzy Logic, truth values are real values in the closed
        interval [0..1]. The definitions of the boolean operators are
        extended to fit this continuous domain. By avoiding discrete
        truth-values, Fuzzy Logic avoids some of the problems inherent in
        either-or judgments and yields natural interpretations of utterances
        like "very hot". Fuzzy Logic has applications in control theory.

   Iterative Deepening:
	An uninformed search that combines good properties of
	Depth-fisrt and Breadth-first search.

   Iterative Deepening A*:
	The ideas of iterative deepening applied to A*.

   Machine Learning:
	A field of AI concerned with programs that learn.  It includes
	Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks among many other
	fields. 

   MiniMax:
	An algorithm for game playing in games with perfect
	information.  See alpha-beta pruning.

   Modus Ponens:
	An inference rule that says: if you know x and you know that
	'If x is true then y is true' then you can conclude y.

   Nonlinear Planning:
        A planning paradigm which does not enforce a total (linear)
        ordering on the components of a plan.

   Partial Order Planner:
	A planner that only orders steps that need to be ordered, and
	leaves unordered any steps that can be done in any order.

   Planning:
	A field of AI concerned with systems that constuct sequences
	of actions to acheive goals in real-world-like environments.

   Problem Space (also State Space):
	The formulation of an AI problem into states and operators.
	There is usually a start state and a goal state.  The problem
	space is searched to find a solution.

   Search:
	The finding of a path from a start state to a goal state.  See
	'Admissibility', 'Problem Space', and 'Heuristic'.

   Strong AI:           
        Claim that computers can be made to actually think, just like human
        beings do. More precisely, the claim that there exists a class of
        computer programs, such that any implementation of such a program is
        really thinking.

   Unification:
	The process of finding a substitution (an assignment of
	constants and variables to variables) that makes two logical
	statements look the same.

   Validation:
        The process of confirming that one's model uses measureable inputs
        and produces output that can be used to make decisions about the
        real world.

   Verification:
        The process of confirming that an implemented model works as intended.

   Weak AI:             
        Claim that computers are important tools in the modeling and
        simulation of human activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-9] What are the top schools in AI?
note:  The answer to this question is clearly out of date.  Any help
would be appreciated.

The answer to this question is not intended to be a ranking and should
not be interpreted as such. There are several major problems with
ratings like the Gourman Report and the US News and World Report. Such
rankings are often unsubstantiated and anecdotal, their accuracy is
questionable, and they do not focus on the subfields of an area. When
selecting a graduate school, students should look for schools which
not only have excellent programs in their general area of research
but also at least one faculty member whose research interests mesh
well with the student's.  Accordingly, we've broken down this list
according to topic, and sorted the schools within each topic in
ALPHABETICAL ORDER. 

For a school to be added to a topic area, there should at least two
faculty actively conducting research in that area and the school
should have a "good" reputation in that area. Exceptions are made for
schools which only have one faculty member in the area, but that
professor is a "leader" of the area, or for fields where the total
number of people working in the area is small in the first place. The
general idea behind these criteria is to ensure that a school has
enough activity in the area that a student who considers one of these
schools won't be disappointed if one of the faculty in that area is on
sabbatical or isn't taking students. Note that the research need not
be conducted in the school's computer science department for the
school to be listed -- in some cases we've included schools where the
research is being conducted in a different department or special laboratory.

The best way for students to discover which schools are good in a
field is to ask professors (and graduate students) in their
undergraduate school for suggestions on where to apply. Reading the
research journals in the field is another good method (see part 3 of
the FAQ).

Subject: [1-11] What are the rules for the game of "Life"?

Cellular Automata, of which Life is an example, were suggested by
Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, and first formalized by von Neumann.
Conway's "Game of Life" was popularized in Martin Gardner's
mathematical games column in the October 1970 and February 1971 issues
of Scientific American.  (Shorter notes on life are alse given in the
column in each month from October 1970 to April 1971, and well as
November 1971, January 1972, and December 1972.) There's also quite a
bit on the game in "The Recursive Universe", by William Poundstone,
Oxford University Press, 1987, 252 pages.
 
The rules for the game of life are quite simple. The game board is a
rectangular cell array, with each cell either empty or filled. At each
tick of the clock, we generate the next generation by the following rules:

        if a cell is empty, fill it if 3 of its neighbors are filled
        (otherwise leave it empty)

        if a cell is filled, it
                dies of loneliness if it has 1 or fewer neighbors
                continues to live if it has 2 or 3 neighbors
                dies of overcrowding if it has more than 3 neighbors

Neighbors include the cells on the diagonals. Some implementations use
a torus-based array (edges joined top-to-bottom and left-to-right) for
computing neighbors. 

For example, a row of 3 filled cells will become a column of 3 filled
cells in the next generation. The R pentomino is an interesting
pattern: 

      xx
     xx
      x

Try it with other patterns of 5 cells initially occupied. If you
record the ages of cells, and map the ages to colors, you can get a
variety of beautiful images.

When implementing Life, be sure to maintain separate arrays for the
old and new generation. Updating the array in place will not work
correctly. Another optimization to to maintain a list of the cells
that changed.

Conway has demonstrated that it is possible to construct the basic
building blocks of a computer from Life using modified glider guns.

   Ways", Academic Press, New York, 1982, ISBN 0-120911-507.

Subject: [1-12] What AI competitions exist?

The Loebner Prize, based on a fund of over $100,000 established by New
York businessman Hugh G. Loebner, is awarded annually for the computer
program that best emulates natural human behavior. During the
contest, a panel of independent judges attempts to determine whether
the responses on a computer terminal are being produced by a computer
or a person, along the lines of the Turing Test. The designers of the
best program each year win a cash award and a medal. If a program
passes the test in all its particulars, then the entire fund will be
paid to the program's designer and the fund abolished. For further
information about the Loebner Prize, see the URL

Stiquito is a small (3cm H x 7cm W x 6cm L), simple (32 parts) and
inexpensive (< $30) nitinol-propelled hexapod robot developed at the
Indiana University (Bloomington) Robotics Laboratory.  Its legs are
propelled by nitnol actuator wires. Each leg has one degree of freedom.
The robot walks up to 10 centimeters per minute and can carry a 9-volt
cell, a MOSIS "tiny chip" and power transistors to drive the nitinol
actuator wires. Nitinol wire (aka BioMetal, Flexinol), is a nickel-titanium
alloy which exerts useful force as it is heated by passing a current
through it. IUCS Technical Report 363a describes Stiquito's construction
and is available by anonymous ftp from 

   cs.indiana.edu:/pub/stiquito/ [129.79.254.191]

as are many other related files.  The tech report is also
available by US mail for $5 (checks or money orders should be made payable
to "Indiana University") from Computer Science Department, Attn: TR 363a

Subject: [1-14] AI Job Postings

A mailing list (AI-Jobs) once existed to help programmers and

companies with AI programming and research positions find capable AI
programmers and researchers.

[According to the archives at ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/, this list
has not been active since '96.]

[For neural networks, the Neuron Digest and Connectionists mailing
lists are a good source of job postings. For computer vision, the
VISION-LIST digest includes occasional job announcements. A good
source for general AI is Computists' Communique. For postdoctoral
appointments, see sci.research.postdocs.]

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-15] Future Directions of AI

The purpose of this question is to compile a list of major ongoing and
future thrusts of AI. To be included in this list a research problem
or application must have the following characteristics:

   [1]  Collaborative Community Effort: It must span several subfields
        of AI, requiring some degree of collaboration between AI
        researchers of different specialties. The idea is to help
        unify the fragmented subfields with a common purpose or
        purposes. 

   [2]  High Impact: It must address important problems of widespread interest.
        Solving the problem must matter to many people and not simply
        be adding another grain of sand on the anthill. This will help
        motivate and excite researchers, and justify the field to outsiders.

   [3]  Short Horizon for Progress: It must be possible to have incremental
        progress and not be an all or nothing problem. For example,
        problems where we can reasonably expect to make significant
        measurable progress over the next 10 years or so.

   [4]  Drive Basic Research: It should involve more than just
        applying current technology, but should drive basic research
        and the development of new technology (possibly in completely
        new directions). 

In short, these problems should be "Grand Challenges" for AI. If you
were trying to describe the field of AI to a layman, what concrete
problems would you use to illustrate the overall vision of the field?
Saying that the goal of AI is to produce "thinking machines that solve
problems" doesn't quite cut it.

   o  Knowbots/Infobots, Web Agents and Intelligent Help Desks
         Unified NLU, NLG, Information Retrieval, KR, Reasoning,
         Intelligent User Interfaces, Qualitative Reasoning.

   o  Autonomous Vehicles
         Unified Robotics, Machine Vision, Machine Learning,
         Intelligent Control, Planning

   o  Machine Translation
         Unified NLU, NLG, Knowledge Representation, Speech Understanding,
         Speech Synthesis 

It seems appropriate to mention, in this context, some of the early
goals of AI.  In 1958 Newell and Simon predicted that computers would
-- by 1970 -- be capable of composing classical music, discovering
important new mathematical theorems, playing chess at grandmaster
level, and understanding and translating spoken language. Although
these predictions were overly optimistic, they did represent a set of
focused goals for the field of AI. [See H. A. Simon and A. Newell,
"Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations Research",
Operation Research, pages 1-10, January-February 1958.]
