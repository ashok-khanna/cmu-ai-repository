<PRE>
     Adams, D. with Carwardine M. (1990) "Last Chance to see...",  London:
     Heinemann.  [David  Corne:  I  strongly  suggest you read this. Its a
     report on visits to various parts of  the  world  to  see  endangered
     species. It is remarkably and wonderfully funny and illuminating.  It
     would actually be a good reference to have in any bit of the  FAQ  to
     do  with  genetic  diversity and/or the lack of it, or the remarkable
     kinds of adaptations that can occur for the strangest reasons.]

     There  is a *lot* of interesting material on biology and evolution in
     the talk.origins newsgroup repository, available by FTP. The index of
     files,  available  from <A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ics.uci.edu/pub/origins/Index">ics.uci.edu:/pub/origins/Index</A> , lists what's
     there, and includes files  on  Darwinism,  definition  of  evolution,
     introduction  to evolutionary biology, a list of important FAQ files,
     speciation,  and genetic drift.
