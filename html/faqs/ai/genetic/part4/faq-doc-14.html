 3. Pointers to upcoming Conferences:
  The Genetic Algorithm Digest
     Aka "GA-Digest" always starts with a "Calendar of GA-related Events,"
     i.e.   a list of upcoming conferences, covering the complete field of
     EAs. (cf Q15)

  The Artificial Life Digest
     Aka "Alife digest" always starts with a  "Calendar  of  Alife-related
     Events," that lists conferences, workshops, etc. (cf Q15)

  The Evolutionary Programming Digest
     Aka   "EP-digest"  doesn't  list  conferences  explicitly,  like  the
     previously mentioned ones, but carries most CFP's; that can be looked
     at   in   the   backissues   folder  as:  <A NAME=id21 HREF="ftp://magenta.me.fau.edu/pub/ep-">magenta.me.fau.edu:/pub/ep-</A>
     list/digest/vX.YYY.Z (cf Q15)
