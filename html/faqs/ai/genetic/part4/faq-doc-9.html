<H1>Q10.8: On-line bibliography collections?</H1>
<PRE>
 The Big One
     Jarmo Alander has  compiled  probably  the  biggest  EC  bibliography
     around.  It  has 2500 entries, and is available in postscript form by
     ftp from: <A NAME=id3 HREF="ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/research/2500GArefs.ps.gz">garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/research/2500GArefs.ps.gz</A> and also  from
     ENCORE  (see  Q15.3)  in  file  refs/2500GArefs.ps.gz Please send any
     additions or corrections to &#60;ja@cs.hut.fi&#62;

     The same directory on ENCORE also contains  some  other  bibliography
     collections.

 Bibliography at Florida Atlantic University
     A  bibliography  of  over  400  entries  in  the area of Evolutionary
     Computation (GA/ES/EP/GP) is  available  (in  BibTeX  and  PostScript
     formats,       compressed)      by      anonymous      FTP      from:
     <A NAME=id4 HREF="ftp://magenta.me.fau.edu/pub/ep-list/bib/EC-ref.bib.Z">magenta.me.fau.edu:/pub/ep-list/bib/EC-ref.bib.Z</A> and EC-ref.ps.Z

     Please     send     any     additions     and     corrections      to
     &#60;nsaravan@cehps01.ce.ford.com&#62; or &#60;EP-List@magenta.me.fau.edu&#62;.

 Combinations of GAs and NNs
     Dave Schaffer &#60;ds1@philabs.Philips.Com&#62; has compiled a bibliograpy on
     combinations of GAs and neural networks. About 150 entries, available
     in Bib format from ENCORE (See Q15.3) in file refs/cogann.bib.gz
     Jochen   Ruhland  &#60;jochenr@neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de&#62;  has  also
     compiled a bibliography on this topic. Some  papers  deal  only  with
     neural  networks,  some  only  with  genetic  algorithms.   About 300
     references altogether. Some include  an  abstract.   Available  from:
     <A NAME=id5 HREF="ftp://ftp.neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de/pub/NeuralNets/">ftp.neuro.informatik.uni-kassel.de:/pub/NeuralNets/</A>                in
     We_and_our_work/papers/diplom.1.bib.gz There are plans to expand this
     bibliography   from  time  to  time;  the  sequels  will  have  names
     diplom.2.bib.gz, etc.

 Bibliography at IlliGAL
     A bibliography on Genetic Algorithms compiled by David  E.  Goldberg,
     Kelsey  Milman,  and Christina Tidd is available as IlliGAL Report No
     92008        (see         Q14),         via         ftp         from:
     <A NAME=id6 HREF="ftp://gal4.ge.uiuc.edu/pub/papers/IlliGALs/92008part1.ps.Z">gal4.ge.uiuc.edu:/pub/papers/IlliGALs/92008part1.ps.Z</A>             and
     92008part2.ps.Z

 GAPHD Bibliography Collection
     Martyn   Amos   &#60;Martyn.Amos@dcs.warwick.ac.uk&#62;   has   assembled   a
     collection  of  bibliographies  from  various  sources, tidied up the
     entries and removed duplicates. The collections are as follows:

	 Alife.bib.gz      - General Artificial Life
	 ICGA-93.bib.gz    - Proc. International Conference on GAs (1993)
	 chaos.bib.gz      - Chaos theory
	 ga+nn.bib.gz      - GAs and neural networks
	 ga.bib.gz         - General GA references
	 ga2.bib.gz        - General GA references
	 parallelGA.bib.gz - Parallel GAs
	 theory.bib.gz     - Theoretical computer science (bias towards graph
			   theory, stochasic modelling and pobability theory)
	 misc.bib.gz       - Miscellaneous topics (eg. Internet)

     There are about 6200 references in total, although the  biggest  file
     by  far  is  theory.bib,  which  is  not  directly related to EC. The
     references are in BibTeX format. The files are available by FTP  from
     <A NAME=id7 HREF="ftp://ftp.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pub/gaphd/Bibliographies/">ftp.dcs.warwick.ac.uk:/pub/gaphd/Bibliographies/</A>   or   by  WWW  from
