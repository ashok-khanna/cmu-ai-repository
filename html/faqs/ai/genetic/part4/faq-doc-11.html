     Carnegie Mellon University is establishing an Artificial Intelligence
     Repository  to  contain  public  domain  and   freely   distributable
     software,  publications,  and  other  materials  of  interest  to  AI
     researchers, educators, and  students.  The  AI  Repository  will  be
     accessible  by  anonymous  FTP  and  Andrew File System (AFS) without
     charge (See Q15.3).  The contents of  the  repository  will  also  be
     published  by  Prime  Time  Freeware  as  an  inexpensive mixed-media
     (Book/CD-ROM) publication.

     For your information, here is a precis of the CD-ROM:

     PTF for AI is a periodic collection of  AI-related  source  code  and
     documentation.   PTF for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions

     contained ~600  MB  of  gzipped  archives  (2+  GB  uncompressed  and
     unpacked).  Cost: $60 US.
