<H1>Q15.3: What online information repositories are there?</H1>
<PRE>
     Many research institutes  have  online  repositories  of  information
     which  my  be  retrieved  using FTP or (increasingly), World Wide Web
     (WWW).

     NOTE: See also Q14 above.

 ENCORE
     ENCORE  (The  EvolutioNary  COmputation  REpository  network)  is   a
     collection of anonymous FTP servers providing a wealth of information
     in the  area  of  EC,  from  technical  reports,  copies  of  journal
     articles,  down  to  source  code  for various EAs.  ENCORE acts as a
     distributor of much material generated at  research  institutes  (and
     other places) which don't necessarily have their own FTP servers.

     Each  node  of  ENCORE  is  referred  to as an "EClair".  The default
     EClair node of ENCORE is at the Santa Fe Institute (USA):

     o  <A NAME=id35 HREF="ftp://alife.santafe.edu/pub/USER-AREA/EC/">alife.santafe.edu:/pub/USER-AREA/EC/</A>

     Other sites mirror the contents of the default node, and include: The
     Chinese University of Hong Kong:

     o  <A NAME=id36 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cuhk.hk/pub/EC/">ftp.cs.cuhk.hk:/pub/EC/</A>

     The University of Warwick (United Kingdom):

     o  <A NAME=id37 HREF="ftp://ftp.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/pub/mirrors/EC/">ftp.dcs.warwick.ac.uk:/pub/mirrors/EC/</A>

     EUnet Deutschland GmbH (Germany):

     o  <A NAME=id38 HREF="ftp://ftp.germany.eu.net/pub/research/softcomp/EC/">ftp.Germany.EU.net:/pub/research/softcomp/EC/</A>

     The California Institute of Technology:

     o  <A NAME=id39 HREF="ftp://ftp.krl.caltech.edu/pub/EC/">ftp.krl.caltech.edu:/pub/EC/</A>

     Wayne State University, Detroit:
     o  <A NAME=id40 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wayne.edu/pub/EC/">ftp.cs.wayne.edu:/pub/EC/</A>

     University of Cape Town, South Africa:

     o  <A NAME=id41 HREF="ftp://ftp.uct.ac.za/pub/mirrors/EC/">ftp.uct.ac.za:/pub/mirrors/EC/</A>

     The Michigan State University, East Lansing:
     o  <A NAME=id42 HREF="ftp://ftp.egr.msu.edu/pub/EC/">ftp.egr.msu.edu:/pub/EC/</A>

     Well  worth  getting is "The Navigator's Guide to ENCORE", a handbook
     to this service, in file:

     o  handbook/encore.ps.gz (A4 paper) or

     o  handbook/encore-US.ps.gz (US letter size paper).

     ENCORE is administered by Joerg Heitkoetter &#60;joke@Germany.EU.net&#62;.

 The Santa Fe Institute
     The Santa Fe Institute Studies in the Sciences  of  Complexity  (SFI)

     Complexity, published by Addison Wesley and maintains  a  well-sorted
     FTP server with EC related material.

     o  Admin requests: &#60;ftp@santafe.edu&#62;

     o  Anonymous FTP archive: <A NAME=id43 HREF="ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/">ftp.santafe.edu:/pub/</A>

 The Australian National University (ANU)
     The Bioinformatics facility at Australian National University has set
     up  an  anonymous  FTP  server,  that  contains  EC related material,
     maintained by David G. Green.

     o  Admin requests: &#60;david.green@anu.edu.au&#62;

     o  Anonymous FTP archive: <A NAME=id44 HREF="ftp://life.anu.edu.au/pub/complex_systems/alife/">life.anu.edu.au:/pub/complex_systems/alife/</A>

     o  Gopher protocol: Besides direct access to all FTP information, the
	gopher server offers online access to relevant newsgroups,  online
	databases and direct links to relevant international services.

	Name=Complex   systems,   Host=life.anu.edu.au,  Type=1,  Port=70,
	Path=1/complex_systems.

     o  World Wide Web protocol: Besides access to all of the  above,  the
	hypermedia  server  offers  introductory  tutorials, preprints and
	papers    online.    The    URL    for     this     service     is
	<A NAME=id45 HREF="http://life.anu.edu.au/complex_systems/complex.html">http://life.anu.edu.au/complex_systems/complex.html</A>  or  link  via

 The MSU Genetic Algorithms Research and Applications Group (GARAGe)
     GARAGe has a number of interesting projects, both in terms of GA  and
     GP   fundamental   research  and  in  GA/GP  applications  including:
     parallelization  of  GAs/GPs;  multiple  POPULATION  topologies   and
     interchange   methodologies;   scheduling   applications,   including
     sponsored research  on  job-floor  scheduling;  design  applications,
     including   sponsored   research   on   composite   material  design;
     configuration  applications,  particularly  physics  applications  of
     optimal  molecule  configurations  for  particular  systems  like C60
     (buckyballs) and others.

 School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex
     The   Evolutionary   and  Adaptive  Systems  Group  in  COGS  does  a
     significant amount of research in the area of GAs and Neural Networks
     and  modeling  the process of biological development. For purposes of
     artificial EVOLUTION, many at COGS see this as the major issue to  be
     tackled.   For  general  info about the group, consult the WWW server
     at: <A NAME=id52 HREF="http://<a name=id53 href=/"ftp://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/lab/adapt/index.html</A>">www.cogs.susx.ac.uk:/lab/adapt/index.html">http://<A NAME=id54 HREF="ftp://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/lab/adapt/index.html</A></A>">www.cogs.susx.ac.uk:/lab/adapt/index.html</A></A></A>

 The Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence
     The Navy Center  for  Applied  Research  in  ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE
     (NCARAI)  is  conducting  basic  research  in the analysis of GAs and
     other evolutionary algorithms.  GAs are being applied to the learning
     of   strategies  and  behaviors  for  autonomous  vehicles,  and  for
     adaptively testing complex systems such as vehicle controllers.   You
     will  find  description  of  projects,  researchers, and downloadable
     papers at  URL  <A NAME=id55 HREF="http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/">http://www.aic.nrl.navy.mil/</A>  in  addition  to  other
     information.   The  GA-digest  and the GENETIC ALGORITHMs Archive are
     maintained at NCARAI.  See Q15.1, "Genetic  Algorithms  Digest",  for
     more information.

 Case Western Reserve University
     A  WWW home page is available for the CWRU Autonomous Agents Research
     Group at: <A NAME=id56 HREF="ftp://alpha.ces.cwru.edu/pub/agents/home.html">ftp://alpha.ces.cwru.edu/pub/agents/home.html</A>

     The group, led by Randall Beer, conducts  interdisciplinary  research
     in  the  departments  of  Computer  Engineering and Science, Biology,
     Mechanical  Engineering,  and  Systems  Engineering.   This  research
     includes  work  in  evolutionary  algorithms,  mobile  robotics,  and
     computational biology.  The aim is to study the mechanisms  that  can
     produce adaptive behavior in animals and ROBOTs.

     Currently  available  are  Postscript  versions  of  a  number of our
     research papers (in particular, those  related  to  mobile  robotics,
     evolving  recurrent  neural  networks,  and  computational  models of
     development), an HTML version of a paper on computational development
     which  appeared  in  ALIFE  IV,  and images of the ROBOTs used in our
     research.
