and are available from rtfm.mit.edu directory /pub/usenet/sci.answers/
in files linear-programming-faq and nonlinear-programming-faq.

   ICOT:
Japan's Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) has
made their software available to the public free of charge. The
collection includes a variety of prolog-based programs in symbol
processing, knowledge representation, reasoning and problem solving,
natural language processing. All programs are available by anonymous
ftp from ftp.icot.or.jp. Note that most of the programs are written for
the PSI machines, and very few have been ported to Unix-based
emulators. Some languages are discussed in section [2-1] in part2 of
this FAQ; for further information, send email to ifs@icot.or.jp, or
write to ICOT Free Software Desk, Institute for New Generation Computer

   PTF:
The Prime Time Freeware CD-ROM series contains various items mentioned
in this FAQ including Mark Kantrowitz's AI Repository, some ICOT
material, BERTRAND, GARNET, and LIFE. Prime Time Freeware for UNIX
sells for $60 US, list, and is issued twice each year. E-mail
&#60;ptf@cfcl.com&#62; for more details.

   University of Washington (Seattle):
Constraint-related papers and solvers/implementations including
ThingLabII, CoolDraw (a constraint-based drawing system), and the
DeltaBlue and SkyBlue algorithms. All public domain. Contact Alan
Borning &#60;borning@cs.washington.edu&#62; for details.
