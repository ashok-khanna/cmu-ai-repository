<PRE>
This guide lists constraint-related resources: archives, newsgroups,
books, magazines, compilers and interpreters (in part 2), and anything
else you can think of. Also included is a list of suppliers of products
and a list of publishers.

This guide is regularly posted in two parts to comp.constraints,
usually on the 17th or 18th of each month.

It may also be obtained by anonymous ftp from City University:
	ftp.cs.city.ac.uk [138.40.91.9],
 using username "anonymous" and password "name@host".
 The files part1 and part2 are located in the directory
	pub/constraints/constraints-faq/
 [The ftp site will also contain other items on constraints.]

WWW (World Wide Web) address:
	<A NAME=id1 HREF="http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/archive/constraints/constraints.html">http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/archive/constraints/constraints.html</A>
This is also a jumping-off point giving access to most of the ftp sites
mentioned in section [1-5].

The articles posted to the newsgroup are archived by month in the same
location as this FAQ, in subdirectory
<A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.city.ac.uk/pub/constraints/archive/comp.constraints">ftp.cs.city.ac.uk:/pub/constraints/archive/comp.constraints</A>

The FAQ postings are also archived in the periodic posting archive on
rtfm.mit.edu. Look in the anonymous ftp directory
/pub/usenet/news.answers/constraints-faq in the files part1 and part2.
If you do not have anonymous ftp access, you can access the archive by
mail server as well. Send an E-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with "help" and "index" in the body on separate lines for more
information.

FAQs and Resource Guides for other newsgroups will usually be available
on rtfm.mit.edu too.
