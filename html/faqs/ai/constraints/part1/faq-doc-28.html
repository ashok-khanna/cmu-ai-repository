<H1>[1-24] Constraint Abstraction</H1>
<PRE>

by Chris Beck (chris@{cs,ie}.utoronto.ca)

Given CSP C to solve, we would like to know how to transform it
into CSP C' such that:
	1) C' is more easily solved than C.
	2) Solving C' provides knowledge that makes the subsequent
	   search for a solution to C easier.
	3) The transformation from C to C' can be efficiently
	   achieved.

The transformation of C to C' is the "abstraction" of C to the
"higher-level" C'.

Berthe Y. Choueiry (choueiry@liasun1.epfl.ch) notes:

} Since a CSP has the following components:
}	- a set of variables
}	- a set of values per variable
}	- a set of constraints
} 
} Abstraction techniques could potentially be applied to any of these
} components. Here follows a *NON-EXHAUSTIVE* list of *examples*:
} 
} Abstracting variables:
}	- good old techniques of graph reduction
}	- various strategies clustering (aggregations etc..)
} 
} Abstracting values:
}	- (heuristic) domain reduction
}	- more formally, interchangeability (defined by Freuder, also
}	  studied by Haselboeck, and applied to resource allocation
}	  by myself). 
} 
} Constraint abstraction: 
}	- such as scoping, localization, decomposition, conflict
}	  isolation. etc.. 
}	- generalization (mainly for explanation purposes..)
} 
} These techniques could be probabilistic, heuristic, exact, etc..
} There is a trend to formally evaluate these techniques or the problems
} they are being applied to, in terms of computational complexity.
