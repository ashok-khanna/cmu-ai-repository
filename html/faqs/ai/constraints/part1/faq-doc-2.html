<PRE>
``Constraint programming techniques can be more declarative and elegant
(hence maintainable) than standard imperative languages, without
sacrificing efficiency.''

Areas of interest include:		[suggestions welcome]
 constraint satisfaction problem (eg Travelling Salesman)
 constraint satisfaction in AI
 constraint logic programming
 concurrent constraint programming
 complexity of constraint satisfaction
 dynamic (dynamically changing) constraint satisfaction problems
 partial constraint satisfaction
 hierarchical CLP
 object-oriented constraints
 deductive databases
 applications
 links to linear programming
 heterogeneous systems (e.g. mixtures of constraints with C (see [1-12]),
	expert system shells, constraint imperative programming etc).
