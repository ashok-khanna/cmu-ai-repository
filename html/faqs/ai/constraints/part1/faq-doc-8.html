Polynomial Network Consistency Algorithms for Constraint Satisfaction
Problems", in Artificial Intelligence, 1985, 25:65-73

Phase Transitions in Constraint Satisfaction Problems
-----------------------------------------------------

The search difficulty of constraint satisfaction problems can be
determined, on average, from knowledge of easily computed structural
properties of the problems. In fact, hard problem instances are
concentrated near an abrupt transition between under- and over-
constrained problems. This transition is analogous to phase transitions
in physical systems and offers a way to estimate the likely difficulty
of a constraint problem before attempting to solve it with search.
