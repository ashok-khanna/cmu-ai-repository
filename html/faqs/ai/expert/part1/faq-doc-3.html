<PRE>
This section contains a list of key references and introductions about
Production Systems, Expert Systems, and Match Algorithms. For other
AI-related books, see part 4 of the AI FAQ.

Overviews and Texts:

   Bruce G. Buchanan and Edward H. Shortliffe, "Rule-Based Expert
   Systems: The MYCIN Experiments of the Stanford Heuristic Programming
   Project", Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1985. The Davis and King
   paper (chapter 4, "An overview of production systems") provides
   a good overview.

   Frederick Hayes-Roth, "The knowledge based expert system: A tutorial",
   IEEE Computer 17(9):11-28, 1984.

   Bruce G. Buchanan and R.O. Duda, "Principles of Rule-Based Systems",
   Tech Report HPP-82-14, 1982. (Discusses the design of expert
   systems, including representation, inference, and uncertainty
   management. Examples from numerous specific systems, and discusses
   which problems are suitable for attack by rule-based systems.)

   and Implementation of Rule-Based Expert Systems", McGraw-Hill,
   1991. 402 pages, ISBN 0-07-909785-5 ($37.50). [Focuses on the
   building of the knowledge-base model and its proper implmentation
   from a decision-making perspective. Also covers knowledge
   acquisition, inference, and validation. Especially good for
   students in fields besides computer science, such as business,
   engineering, and the social sciences. There are exercises at the
   end of every chapter. Clear and concise explanations with good
   examples. Also provides an introduction to EXSYS with an EXSYS demo disk.]
