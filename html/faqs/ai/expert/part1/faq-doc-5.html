Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .gz, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .gz suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from:
  prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/{gzip-1.2.3.shar,gzip-1.2.3.tar,gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe}

If you do not have ftp access, you can FTP files by E-mail. Send a
message with the word "help" in the body to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.


FOCL is an expert system shell and machine learning program written in
Common Lisp. The machine learning program extends Quinlan's FOIL
program by containing a compatible explanation-based learning
component.  FOCL learns Horn Clause programs from examples and
(optionally) background knowledge. The expert system includes a
backward-chaining rule interpreter and a graphical interface to the
rule and fact base. For details on FOCL, see: Pazzani, M. and Kibler,
D., "The role of prior knowledge in inductive learning", Machine
Learning 9:54-97, 1992. It is available by anonymous ftp from
   <A NAME=id11 HREF="ftp://ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-programs/">ics.uci.edu:/pub/machine-learning-programs/</A>
as the files README.FOCL-1-2-3, FOCL-1-2-3.cpt.hqx (a binhexed,
compacted Macintosh application), FOCL-1-2-3.tar.Z (Common Lisp
source code), and FOCL-1-2-3-manual.hqx (binhexed manual).  If you
use a copy of FOCL, or have any comments or questions, send mail to
pazzani@ics.uci.edu.

BABYLON is a development environment for expert systems. It
includes frames, constraints, a prolog-like logic formalism, and a
description language for diagnostic applications. It is implemented in
Common Lisp and has been ported to a wide range of hardware platforms.
Available by anonymous ftp from 
   <A NAME=id15 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/gmd/ai-research/Software/Babylon/">ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/ai-research/Software/Babylon/</A> [129.26.8.84]
as a BinHexed stuffit archive, on the Web via the URL
   <A NAME=id16 HREF="http://www.gmd.de/">http://www.gmd.de/</A>
on the Apple CD-ROM, or with the book "The AI Workbench BABYLON",
which contains *full source code* of BABYLON and the stand-alone
version for the Mac. The book describes the use of BABYLON in detail.

MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from
   <A NAME=id17 HREF="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/gmd/mlt/Mobal/">ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/</A>
The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a
graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

MIKE (Micro Interpreter for Knowledge Engineering) is a full-featured,
free, and portable software environment designed for teaching purposes
at the UK's Open University.  It includes forward and backward
chaining rules with user-definable conflict resolution strategies, and
a frame representation language with inheritance and 'demons' (code
triggered by frame access or change), plus user-settable inheritance
strategies.  Automatic 'how' explanations (proof histories) are
provided for rule exectuion, as are user-specified 'why' explanations.
Coarse-grained and fine-grained rule tracing facilities are provided,
along with a novel 'rule graph' display which concisely shows the
history of rule execution.  MIKE, which forms the kernel of an Open
University course on Knowledge Engineering, is written in a
conservative and portable subset of Edinburgh-syntax Prolog, and is
distributed as non-copy-protected source code. MIKE version 1 was
described in the October/November 1990 issue of BYTE. MIKE v1.50,
which was formerly available from a range of ftp servers, has been
superseded by two newer versions: MIKEv2.03, a full Prolog source code
version, incorporating a RETE algorithm for fast forward chaining, a
truth maintenance system, uncertainty handling, and hypothetical
worlds, and MIKEv2.50, a turnkey DOS version with menu-driven
interface and frame- and rule-browsing tools, fully compatible with
MIKEv2.03, but without source code.  They are available by anonymous
ftp from hcrl.open.ac.uk [137.108.81.16] as the files
   MIKEv2.03: /pub/software/src/MIKEv2.03/*
   MIKEv2.50: /pub/software/pc/MIKEV25.ZIP
They are also available from the CMU AI Repository.

ES: The October/November 1990 issue of BYTE also described the ES
expert system. ES supports backward/forward chaining, fuzzy set
relations, and explanation, and is a standalone executable for
IBM-PCs. ES is available by anonymous ftp from
<A NAME=id18 HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/ai/expert-sys/">ftp.uu.net:/pub/ai/expert-sys/</A> [192.48.96.9] as summers.tar.Z.
ftp.uu.net is mirrored on unix.hensa.ac.uk [129.12.21.7] under
/pub/uunet/.

WindExS (Windows Expert System) is a fully functional Windows-based
forward chaining expert system. Its modular architecture allows the
user to substitute new modules as required to enhance the capabilites
of the system. WindExS sports Natural Language Rule Processor,
Inference Engine, File Manager, User Interface, Message Manager and
Knowledge Base modules. It supports forward chaining, and graphical
knowledge base representation. Write etoupin@aol.com for documentation
and operational system.

RT-Expert is a shareware expert system that lets C programmers
integrate expert systems rules into their C or C++ applications.
RT-Expert consists of a rule-compiler that compiles rules into C code,
and a library containing the rule execution engine. RT-Expert for DOS
works with Borland Turbo C, Borland C++, and Microsoft C/C++
compilers. The personal edition is licensed for educational, research,
and hobby use. Applications created with RT-Expert personal edition
are not licensed for commercial purposes. Professional editions are
available for commercial applications using DOS, Windows, and Unix
environments. RT-Expert is available by anonymous ftp from
