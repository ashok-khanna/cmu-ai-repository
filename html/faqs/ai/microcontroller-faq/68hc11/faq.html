0)  Rantings and ravings

    Disclaimer:  Just so it is understood, the "rantings and ravings" are
    MY rantings and ravings.  My readers are refined and sophisticated
    and would never rant or rave.  I, on the other hand, sit in front of
    the TV in torn underwear and drink beer out of the bottle.

    As far as whether this FAQ gets split or not, please send me your
    suggestions and opinions.  Spare time is a rare commodity, and it
    would be ashame for me to go to all the effort of splitting this FAQ,
    only to find out that everyone starts to complain about the
    multi-part format.  So what'll it be - one part or multi-part?


    A new feature in 8051 FAQ is a list of individuals who have expressed
    interest in helping others with hardware and software problems for
    8051 systems.  Any one out there who's willing to offer assistance to
    the hc11 crowd?  If you feel you are qualified, and you're willing to
    do a good turn, let me know what your areas of specialization are and
    I'll put together a list for this FAQ.  Thanks!


    Take care,

              Uncle Russ


1)  ABOUT THIS FAQ

1.1)  Who put this FAQ together?

    I started by putting together a FAQ on the 8051 microcontroller in
    response to my own frustration in finding information.  The FAQ has
    now been out for some time and has been very well received.  One of
    the questions that I'm frequently asked is if I know of a FAQ on the
    68hc11.  Not only that, but how many times have you seen the
    following questions posted on the newsgroups:  "anyone know of a C
    compiler for the 68hc11?", "anyone know of an assembler for the
    68hc11?", and so on.

    Therefore, I decided to jump in and try my hand again.  I figured
    that this would be a good learning experience.  From what I've seen
    so far, the 68hc11 is a good chip, and well worth learning and
    developing with.  I really don't have any experience with the 68hc11
    (yet), so I'm going to need everyone's help on this.  Just as with
    the 8051 FAQ, with everyone's help this FAQ should turn out to be a
    pretty useful document.


1.2)  How can I contribute to this list?

    I please ask that if you have any suggestions or additions, or you
    would like to correct any of the information contained herein, please
    send me a note.

    Very, special thanks to Ping Huang and Thomas Koenig of the
    news.answers moderators team for all of their help.

    I certainly hope that those of you who know of interesting items for
    the 68hc11 will share with everyone by contributing to this list.

    If you are a manufacturer and have an anonymous ftp site available
    that supports the 68hc11, please let me know by Email so that I can
    add it to this FAQ.  Also please feel free to keep me updated on your
    products.


1.3)  What newsgroups will this FAQ be posted to?

    This FAQ will be posted to the following newsgroups:
          comp.realtime
          comp.robotics
          sci.electronics
          comp.answers
          sci.answers
          news.answers
    The first three newsgroups often contain discussions, announcements,
    or information on the 68hc11.  Check them out from time to time.  By
    posting to the *.answers newsgroups, the FAQ will automatically be
    archived.  The archive name of this FAQ (also included in the header)
    is: microcontroller-faq/68hc11.

    The schedule for posting will be once a month.  I can't promise that
    it will be on time, but I hope to post it on the 26th of each month.

    You might also want to check out the following newsgroups, since they
    occasionally have items of interest for you 68hc11 users.
          comp.sys.m6809
          comp.sys.m68k
          comp.lang.misc
          alt.comp.hardware.homebuilt

    A bit farther afield, but still of possible interest:
          comp.ai.fuzzy
          comp.dsp
          sci.engr.control
          sci.engr.semiconductors


1.4)  May I post this FAQ to my local BBS?

    I am putting no restrictions on the use of this FAQ except - It must
    be distributed in its entirety with the copyright notice, and no
    financial gain may be realized from it.  After all, I have spent, and
    continue to spend, a lot of time on this, and the only thing that I
    intend to gain from it is more information on the 68hc11, and getting
    to know my fellow 68hc11 groupies better.

    For this reason I have appended a copyright statement to the end of
    this FAQ.  I feel pretty silly doing this, but I just want to protect
    myself.  The copyright does not limit the use of this list for
    noncommercial purposes.  I hereby give my permission to one and all
    to pass this list around and post it wherever you want - as long as
    it is not for financial gain.

        Thank you.


1.5)  How about FAQs on other microcontrollers?

    If anyone wishes to start a FAQ on another microcontroller, please
    feel free to copy the format of this FAQ - I don't intend on
    copyrighting the look and feel ;-).  With a common format, we will
    all benefit when trying to find information on a particular
    microcontroller.

    If anyone has any comments on the format itself, I'm open for
    suggestions.

    Two useful articles are also available.  One article provides a
    tabular cross reference of features and pin counts.  The second
    article provides pinout diagrams of many of the Motorola line of 8
    bit microcontrollers.  Both lists were compiled and are being
    maintained by Roger Nelson &#60;rnelson@mail.wsu.edu&#62;.

    refer to the Microcontroller primer and FAQ listed above.


2)  ABOUT THE 68hc11


2.1)  The 68hc11 microcontroller

    General

    The 68hc11 is a powerful 8-bit data, 16-bit address microcontroller
    from Motorola with an instruction set that is similar to the older
    68xx (6801, 6805, 6809) parts.  Depending on the variety, the 68hc11
    has built-in EEPROM/OTPROM, RAM, digital I/O, timers, A/D converter,
    PWM generator, and synchronous and ansynchronous communications
    channels (RS232 and SPI).  Typical current draw is less than 10ma.


    Architecture

    CPU has two 8 bit accumulators (A &#38; B) that can be concatenated to
    provide a 16 bit double accumulator (D).  Two 16 bit index registers
    are present (X,Y) to provide indexing to anywhere in the memory map.
    Having the two index registers means the 68hc11 is very good for
    processing data.  Although an eight bit processor, the 68hc11 has
    some 16 bit instructions (add, subtract, 16 * 16 divide, 8 * 8
    mulitply, shift, and rotates).  A 16 bit stack pointer is also
    present, and instructions are provided for stack manipulation.
    Typically multiplexed address and data bus.


    Onboard subsystems

    Timer -  Main timer system comprises of a single 16 bit counter
    clocked at the E clock (2,3,or 4 Mhz - there is a programmable
    prescaler to slow it down if required). From this single counter run
    a number of input capture and output compare registers (3-4  IC, 5 -
    4 OC). The IC and OC functions are very versatile, and pulses as
    short as 1 E clock can be generated.

    A-D Convertor - Typically 8 channel 8 bit A/D, although the G5 has a
    10 bit A/D.

    Serial Communications Interface (SCI) - Asynchronous serial
    communications; Data format - 1 Start, 8 or 9 data, and one stop bit.
    Data rate - 150 - 312500 Baud (312500 is using 4 mhz E clock)

    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) - Synchronous serial
    communications, comprises CLK, DATA IN, DATA OUT and optionally chip
    selects.  As well as using specific SPI devices, it is very easy to
    expand IO using the SPI and standard logic devices (e.g. 74HC595 and
    74HC165).


2.2)  68hc11 flavors

    The following are Motorola flavors:

    HC11 A Series
       8K ROM (A8), ROMless (A0,A1), 256 RAM, 256 EEPROM (A1,A8), SPI,
       SCI, 3 IC 5 OC, 8 channel 8 bit A/D

    HC11 C0
       Nice new device.  ROMless, on board bank switching to support
       memory maps of up to 256K.  Totally glueless interface - Chip
       selects on board, Read Enable and Write Enable signals now
       generated on chip.  256 RAM, 8 channel 8 bit A/D - Good pricing

    HC11 D Series
       Smallest and lowest cost member of the hc11 Family.  ROMless (D0),
       4K ROM (D3), 4K EPROM (711D3) - No A-D or EEPROM.  Still has
       standard timers and serial ports

    HC11 E Series
       Same as A series execpt 512 bytes RAM and EEPROM.  Pin compatible,
       only difference is one timer pin (PA4) can now be used for IC or
       OC instect of just OC.  Also have EPROM devices and larger
       memory - hc711e9 (12K OTP), hc711e20 (20K OTP)

    HC11 F series
       ROMless, non multiplexed address/data bus with 4 chip selects
       built in.  1K RAM, 512 bytes EEPROM - otherwise same peripherals
       as E series

    HC11 G Series
       16K ROM/EPROM, Non mulitplexed address/data bus, 512 RAM, 4
       channel PWM, 10 Bit A/D convertor, 2 separate 16 bit timers

    HC11 K4
       24K ROM/EPROM, 1Mb addressing using on chip memory mapping.  Non
       multiplexed address and data  bus. 4 programmable chip selects, 8
       channel 8 bit A/D.  4 channel PWM, 768 bytes RAM

    Toshiba second-sources the 68hc11, and they list the following
    variants: A0/A1/A8 and E0/E1/E9.

    For a nice breakdown of the 68hc11 line, check out the file
    taxonomy.txt at cherupakha.media.mit.edu : /pub/miniboard/hobby-tips.
    The file contains a table detailing all of the possible combinations
    that the 68hc11 is supplied in.


2.3)  Sources and prices

    Sources??  Prices??  Hell - you can't even find the suckers!  For
    those of you who remember the old Chicken Man series on radio, "He's
    everywhere! He's everywhere!" - the 68hc11 is not Chicken Man.  The
    68hc11 - "It's nowhere, it's nowhere!"  I remember one episode in
    which our hero was fighting against an evil plot to steal all of the
    refrigerator light bulbs in the world.  Well, maybe the same thing
    happened with the 68hc11 - they just can't be found.

    Maybe it's just a clever scam.  The 68hc11 really doesn't exist.
    Instead, Motorola cobbled together a microprocessor using an Intel
    8051 running an emulation of the 68hc11 instruction set (Intel
    Inside?).

    Ruud Schramp found some in the Netherlands (sounds like an
    appropriate place to find them).  The breakdown is as follows
    (1 US dollar =+- Dfl 1.70):
       Main Importer of Holland   Dfl 15.-- (quantity &#62;100)
       Main Importer of Holland   Dfl 19.-- (if you buy 1 and if they
                                             want to sell 1)
       Distributor                Dfl 25.-- (also no single sales)
       Shop (Display Electronica) Dfl 35.-- (quantity 1)

    Also, the 68hc11 can be found at the following places:

       Catalog number 112 indicates that the carry Motorola micros
       (including the HC11 family.  These guys are big distributors, so
       they can probably get any part in the HC11 family, but they
       probably won't be cheap.

       Prices shown in their 1992 catalog are:

       They usually have a couple varieties at good prices.


2.4)  Advantages realized in implementing control applications on this
      family of microcontrollers

    Traditional architecture - a more traditional architecture than other
    competing products (such as the 8051 and PIC) makes it easier to
    learn and develop on (especially well-suited for teaching
    microcontrollers)

    More features - a 68hc11 is typically a "one-chip" solution since it
    often includes such items as A/D, PWM, and many I/O lines

    Popular - widely used since it is very inexpensive and has a wide
    range of development tools available (both freeware and commercial)


3)  SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE 68hc11

4)  68hc11 PRODUCTS

    This section includes descriptions and references to free and
    commercial software for the 68hc11.  FTP sites and BBSs contain many
    quality packages and code samples for free.  For heavy duty use, you
    might prefer the many commercial packages that are available.  Some
    very high quality, low-priced packages are available which are
    suitable for both the hobbyist and professional on a limited budget.
    With the public domain (or free) stuff, you're usually on your own.
    The commercial packages usually provide extensive documentation and
    support.

4.2)  Free C compilers

    One of the big advantages of choosing the 68hc11 for your next
    project (especially you hobbyists on a low budget) is the
    availability of freeware and low cost C compilers.

    A freeware version of the Hi-Tech C compiler is available for

    I've been playing with the Dunfield Development System lately (on the
    8051), and it's really quite nice.  I've also heard many good things
    about it from others.  It includes a near ANSI-C compiler, run-time
    library with source, assembler, ROM debugger, integrated development
    environment, monitor with source, utilities, and other extras.
    Although not freeware, the low price ($100), the features, all of the
    extra goodies, and the good reviews make this a package worth looking
    at.  Also, if you're interested in working on more than one family of
    microcontroller, Dunfield supports a wide range.  This means only
    needing to learn one system, instead of many.

    Another decent C compiler comes from ImageCraft.  This package, which
    runs under DOS and OS/2, includes a near ANSI C compiler, assembler,
    linker, librarian, ANSI C functions and headers, and 90 page manual.
    The current release is version 1.02 of their compiler.  The price is
    just $40.  Initial feedback on this compiler seems promising.  The
    pre-release versions are already in use by many of you, and will
    still be available as freeware.

          philosophy seems to be ... well, it seems to be ... uh, yeah!
          Technical in nature, bizarre, tongue in cheek, eclectic,
          electric, did I mention bizarre(?), and lots of fun.  Worth
          looking at if you like the out of the ordinary.  The moving
          force behind this magazine is Daniel Drennan, who seems to have
          suffered from an overdose of radiation from his computer
          monitor ;-).
