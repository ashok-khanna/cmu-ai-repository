0)  Rantings and ravings

    Disclaimer:  Just so it is understood, the "rantings and ravings" are
    my rantings and raving.  My readers are refined and sophisticated and
    would never rant or rave.  I, on the other hand, sit in front of the
    TV in torn underwear and drink beer out of the bottle.

    As far as whether this FAQ gets split or not, please send me your
    suggestions and opinions.  Spare time is a rare commodity, and it
    would be ashame for me to go to all the effort of splitting this FAQ,
    only to find out that everyone starts to complain about the
    multi-part format.  So what'll it be - one part or multi-part?


    I recently received a note from Peter J. Kerrigan that I thought
    might be of interest to many of you:

       Russ:

       Again, thanks so much for your tip on using the DS5K and the
       Dunfield development system.   The savings in time &#38; energy have
       been astounding....

       If I had gone with the 'HC705 as I had planned to, I would still
       be in the starting phase, not almost done!

       The DS5K is without a doubt, THE setup for uC development.  REALLY
       wish I had one of these a few years ago!

    It is not my intention to slight other chips or software packages by
    including the above letter.  It just so happens that the
    Dunfield/Dallas combination works well for me, and I recommend it
    without hesitation.  Many other good products exist, and I hope to
    give more coverage to them in the near future.

1)  ABOUT THIS FAQ

1.1)  Who put this FAQ together?

    I was prompted to put this FAQ together in response to my own
    frustration in searching for information, and to the constant
    occurrence of requests for information on this subject in various
    newsgroups.  Hopefully others won't need to go through what I did.

    Normally, I spend all day programming in assembler on an IBM PC.
    With my hobbyist hat on I decided to try my hand at a little
    microcontroller project design.  When it came time to start, I had no
    idea what to do.  I had nothing to start with - no assembler, no
    programming language, no simulator.  I cobbled together a simulator
    to help me learn about the workings of the chip.  It's not being made
    available to the public since I'm afraid the simulator isn't very
    good.  It was for my own use, so the user interface (there is none)
    really sucks eggs.

    I decided to search the net for information on the 8051.  This list
    was compiled the hard way, logging onto every anonymous ftp site I
    could find and looking around.  I also used Archie, other FAQs and
    lists, and every reference to the 8051 that appeared in the various
    news groups.  It took a long time till stuff finally started popping
    up.  I saved all of my notes and the result was the first version of
    this FAQ.  Responses have been poured in, and the result is a much
    more complete and thorough FAQ.


1.2)  How can I contribute to this list?

    I please ask that if you have any suggestions or additions, or you
    would like to correct any of the information contained herein, please
    send me a note.
         My Email address is:  sibit@datasrv.co.il
         My Snail-Mail address is:
               Russ Hersch
               HaVradim 11
               Ginot Shomron
               ISRAEL

    The list of individuals who have sent suggestions and encouragement
    has finally overflowed.  I hope it suffices to say "Thank you to all
    who have contributed to this FAQ - we all appreciate it."


    Special thanks to:
            Cecil A. Moore (Intel)
            Carl Wall
            Dave Dunfield (Dunfield Development Systems)
            Mark Hopkins
            Olaf Pfeiffer
            Dave Heller
            Kevin Gardner (Philips Semiconductor)


    I hope that those of you who know of interesting items for the 8051
    will share with everyone by contributing to this list.  A good amount
    of stuff is turning up thanks to everyone's help.

    If you are a manufacturer and have an anonymous ftp site or BBS
    available that supports the 8051, please let me know by EMail so that
    I can add it to this FAQ.  Also, please feel free to update me on new
    products.


1.3)  What newsgroups will this FAQ be posted to?

    This FAQ will be posted to the following newsgroups:
          comp.sys.intel
          comp.realtime
          comp.robotics

1.4)  May I post this FAQ to my local BBS?

    I am putting no restrictions on the use of this FAQ except - It must
    be distributed in its entirety with the copyright notice, and no
    financial gain may be realized from it.  After all, I have spent, and
    continue to spend, a lot of time on this.  The only thing that I
    intend to gain from it is more information on the 8051, and getting
    to know my fellow 8051 groupies better.

    For this reason I have appended a copyright statement to the end of
    this FAQ.  I feel pretty silly doing this, but I just want to protect
    myself.  The copyright does not limit the use of this list for
    noncommercial purposes.  I hereby give my permission to one and all
    to pass this list around and post it wherever you want - as long as
    it is not for financial gain.

        Thank you.


1.5)  How about FAQs on other microcontrollers?

    If anyone wishes to start a FAQ on another microcontroller, please
    feel free to copy the format of this FAQ - I don't intend on
    copyrighting the look and feel ;-).  With a common format, we will
    all benefit when trying to find information on a particular
    microcontroller.

2)  ABOUT THE 8051


2.1)  The 8051 microcontroller

    The 8051 is an 8 bit microcontroller originally developed by Intel in
    1980.  It is the world's most popular microcontroller core, made by
    many independent manufacturers (truly multi-sourced).  There were 126
    million 8051s (and variants) shipped in 1993!!

    A typical 8051 contains:
       - CPU with boolean processor
       - 5 or 6 interrupts: 2 are external
                            2 priority levels
       - 2 or 3 16-bit timer/counters
       - programmable full-duplex serial port
         (baud rate provided by one of the timers)
       - 32 I/O lines (four 8-bit ports)
       - RAM
       - ROM/EPROM in some models

    The 8051 architecture is a tad bizarre, but then so are the
    architectures of most microcontrollers due to their specialization
    (check out the PIC for creativity).  One vexing problem with the 8051
    is its very non-orthogonal instruction set - especially the
    restrictions on accessing the different address spaces.  However,
    after some time programming the chip, you can get used to it - maybe
    even appreciate it.

    One strong point of the 8051 is the way it handles interrupts.
    Vectoring to fixed 8-byte areas is convenient and efficient.  Most
    interrupt routines are very short (or at least they should be), and
    generally can fit into the 8-byte area.  Of course if your interrupt
    routine is longer, you can still jump to the appropriate routine from
    within the 8 byte interrupt region.

    The 8051 instruction set is optimized for the one-bit operations so
    often desired in real-world, real-time control applications.  The
    boolean processor provides direct support for bit manipulation.  This
    leads to more efficient programs that need to deal with binary input
    and output conditions inherent in digital-control problems.  Bit
    addressing can be used for test pin monitoring or program control
    flags.


2.2)  8051 Flavors

    The 8051 has the widest range of variants of any embedded controller
    on the market.  The smallest device is the Atmel 89c1051, a 20 Pin
    FLASH variant with 2 timers, UART, 20mA.  The fastest parts are from
    Dallas, with performance close to 10 MIPS!  The most powerful chip is
    the Siemens 80C517A, with 32 Bit ALU, 2 UARTS, 2K RAM, PLCC84
    package, 8 x 16 Bit PWMs, and other features.

    Among the major manufacturers are:
        AMD      Enhanced 8051 parts
        Atmel    FLASH and semi-custom parts
        Dallas   Battery backed, program download, and fastest variants
        Intel    8051 through 80c51gb / 80c51sl
        Matra    80c154, low voltage static variants
        OKI      80c154, mask parts
        Philips  87c748 thru 89c588 - more variants than anyone else
        Siemens  80c501 through 80c517a, and SIECO cores
        SSI      80x52, 2 x HDLC variant for MODEM use


    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

       AMD has a number of enhanced variants including such features as:
       dual data pointers, slave interface with arbitration unit, dual
       port RAM, FIFO buffers, and others.


    Atmel

       The smallest current device is the ATMEL 89c1051, a 20 Pin FLASH
       variant with 2 timers, UART, 20mA.  ATMEL was the first with
       standard pinout FLASH, and with more program cycles than other
       custom pinout FLASH.  These parts compete with OTP and MASK
       product on price, but eliminate inventory problems and the hidden
       costs of OTP development.  This will put real pressure on
       "vanilla" micros like PIC and ST6.


    Dallas Soft Microcontrollers - DS5000(T), DS5001(T), DS2250(T)

       The Dallas Soft Microcontrollers have standard 8051 cores with
       on-chip non-volatile RAM instead of ROM.  This gives the user the
       ability to easily alter the system and is perfect for data
       logging.  These processors are available in both chip and module
       solutions.  Among the features included in this family of
       products:
          - on-chip non-volatile RAM
          - loader in ROM for downloading programs (eliminates the hassle
            of EPROM erase/program/install cycle)
          - built in real time clock option
          - watchdog timer
          - software security (program and data encryption)

       The DS500x is a standard 40 pin DIP package (well, mostly
       standard, it is really a BOX which is about double the height of a
       normal chip).  The DS225x is a SIP version which is functionally
       identical to the DS5000 but usually a bit less expensive.

       The nice thing about having the RAM on-chip, is that the I/O ports
       are unaffected.  When the RAM is configured as CODE memory, the
       DS5000 behaves exactly as a single-chip 8051.  The NV-RAM is
       static with a built-in lithium battery, and has no limitations on
       the number of writes.  You can download your code as many times as
       you like without damaging the device.  The DS5000 also includes a
       loader in ROM, which permits you to bootstrap code into the RAM to
       get underway.  The loader and on-chip RAM have an encryption
       feature with which you can protect your code from being read back
       from the device if you wish.


    Dallas High-Speed Micros - DS80c320, DS87c520, DS87c530

       Real barn-burners - performance up to 10 MIPS!  Dallas was the
       first to speed up the core.  Wasted clock and memory cycles have
       been removed using a redesigned processor core.  As a result,
       every 8051 instruction is executed up to 3 times faster than the
       original for the same crystal speed.  Clock speeds from DC to
       33MHz!

       High performance doesn't just mean speed.  High integration gives
       the user 2 full-duplex hardware serial ports, 13 total interrupt
       sources (6 external), watchdog timer, power management, power-fail
       reset, and other features.


    Intel MCS-51

       Introduced in 1980, it has become the industry standard for
       embedded control.  Intel offers a wide variety of 8051 versions
       with different configurations of on-board EPROM/ROM.  Also low
       power, high integration, and specialized parts are also offered.


    Intel MCS-251

       Intel has announced the MCS-251, which is 100% binary and pin
       compatible with the 8051, but with a 5-15 times boost in
       horsepower.  This is achieved by a six fold gain in bus cycles,
       and further hardware improvements to avoid wasted bus cycles.
       Delivery early 1995.

       Further performance gains are possible by recoding critical
       sections to use the extended features of 16 and 32 bit data
       transfers, arithmetic and logical instructions, register to
       register operations, enhanced BIT manipulations and improved
       control instructions.  In addition to extra 16/32 bit
       instructions, the 251 includes 40 register with Accumulator and
       Index functions overlayed as 16x8, 16x16, 10x32.

       Pin compatible parts allow instant performance upgrades, and the
       binary compatibility truly preserves users investment in code and
       tools.  By staying firmly in the 80x51 camp, Intel allows users
       transparent access to an enormous horsepower range.  To further
       improve throughput in numerically intensive areas, users can use
       INTEGER, LONGINT and FLOAT libraries written for the MCS-251.


    Philips

       Philips has more 8051 variants than anyone else.  Among the
       derivatives that they have:  40MHz, 24 pin skinny DIP, low
       voltage, quad flat pack (QFP) versions for saving board space,
       OTP, I2C bus, and so on.

       The c5xx line features high integration, with many built-in
       features including built-in EMI/RFI suppression.

       The c7xx series are very low-end, inexpensive micros.  They are
       offered with less memory (1k, 2k, etc.) and fewer features.  In
       fact the 83c750 sells for only $1 in very high OEM volumes.


    Siemens sab80c517a

       The 80c517a is one of the most powerful 8051 variants available.
       It features high clock speed (40 MHz), and high integration with
       32 Bit ALU, 2 UARTS, 2K RAM, PLCC84 package, 8x16 bit PWMs, and
       more.


2.3)  8051 representatives and approximate prices (in USD $)

    There are many, many varieties of 8051 out there.  This is only a
    small sampling of typical prices on Intel chips.

        8031 (128 bytes RAM)...................................3.59
        80C31 (CMOS version of previous).......................6.95
        8051AH (256 bytes RAM).................................6.95
        8051AHBASIC (w/Basic interpreter built in)............29.95
        8751 (4K EPROM, 128 bytes RAM)........................26.95
        87C51 (CMOS version of previous)......................39.95


2.4)  Advantages realized in implementing control applications on this
      family of microcontrollers

    Popular - readily available and widely supported, a full range of
    free and commercial support products is available

    Fast and effective - the architecture correlates closely with the
    problem being solved (control systems), specialized instructions mean
    that fewer bytes of code need to be fetched and fewer conditional
    jumps are processed

    Low cost - high level of system integration within one component,
    only a handful of components needed to create a working system

    Wide range -  ONE set of tools covers the greatest horsepower range
    of any microcontroller family, other suppliers handle a number of
    DIFFERENT and INCOMPATIBLE (and often single-sourced) cores to cover
    the same power range as the 80x51, the 8051 provides a real cost
    savings in tools, training, and software support

    Compatibility - opcodes and binaries are the SAME for all 80x51
    variants (unlike most other microcontroller families)

    Multi-sourced - over 12 manufacturers, hundreds of varieties,
    something for everyone with the security of ready availability

    Constant improvements - improvements in silicon/design increase speed
    and power annually, 16 Bit models coming from several manufacturers,
    low cost skinny DIP models now available

3.4)  Help available!

    This is a new feature in the FAQ.  Listed here are individuals who
    have expressed interest in helping others with hardware and software
    problems for 8051 systems.

    Does any one else out there think that they can help?  Just let me
    know what your areas of specialization are and I'll add your name to
    the list.  Thanks!

    Dick Barnett &#60;barnettr@mace.cc.purdue.edu&#62;

       applications.

    Daniel Drennan &#60;xixax@echonyc.com&#62; or &#60;xixax@echonyc.com&#62;
       He claims his electronics knowledge is very rudimentary and
       self-taught (what a modest guy!).  He'll probably be able to point
       you in the right direction.

    Mark Hopkins &#60;mark@omnifest.uwm.edu&#62;
       Mark is the author of the CAS assembler and of the 8051.ZIP
       programs.  He's now working on JOLT, a code generator with a
       C-like syntax.  His areas of specialization include:
       multitasking, interrupts, basic stuff (like addressing, memory
       spaces), the 8052 BASIC chip, interfacing the chip with external
       inputs and outputs


4)  8051 PRODUCTS

    This section includes descriptions and references to free and
    commercial software for the 8051.  FTP sites and BBSs contain many
    quality packages and code samples for free.  For heavy duty use, you
    might prefer the many commercial packages that are available.  With
    the public domain (or free) stuff, you're usually on your own.  The
    commercial packages usually provide extensive documentation and
    support.


4.1)  Free languages and development tools

      Comments:  These two programs together constitute a bare-bones
                 method of developing 80C51 system code without an
                 emulator.  RISM51X is installed in the target system
                 and connected to a host PC system through a serial port.
                 The host PC runs the debugger IECM51.EXE.  Once the
                 system has been debugged, RISM can be removed and the
                 target can be run in stand-alone mode.

4.2)  Free C compilers

    Several commercial C compilers have evaluation versions available.
    These are not too useful (even for hobbyist projects) since they
    usually don't include libraries.  However, they do afford the user
    the chance to inspect the quality of the code generated.  Among those
    currently available:

        An evaluation version of COMPASS is available from Production
        Language Systems.  This package includes a C compiler, assembler,
        debugger, simulator, etc. and runs under Windows 3.1.  This
        package can be downloaded from the IntelC Compuserve forum or
        from their BBS:
              (817)599-8363
              Enter YY8051 as password for first-time login
              (In case of difficulty, contact manvillec@aol.com)

        The Keil C compiler evaluation package is available as a freeware
        C compiler.  It can be downloaded from:
                 ftp.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be : /pub/MCS-51/keil-demo
        Thanks to Christofe Huygens for setting this up.

        A freeware version of the Hi-Tech C compiler used to be available
        from various places.  It seems to have disappeared however.  It
        might still be available at:
              design.fen.qut.edu.au : /hitech

    Mark Hopkins has changed the goal of his compiler project.  Instead
    of implementing a C compiler, he is working on an implementation of
    JOLT for the '51.  Its main characteristic is the complete and
    seamless integration of functional and imperative programming into
    one language.  The language envisioned essentially has a C syntax and
    could probably be mistaken as being a dialect of C.  More on this as
    it develops.

    In most cases, it makes more sense to invest a bit, and get something
    serious.  I've been playing with the Dunfield Development System
    lately, and its really quite nice.  I've also heard many good things
    about it from others.  It includes a near ANSI-C compiler, run-time
    library with source, assembler, ROM debugger, integrated development
    environment, monitor with source, utilities, and other extras.  A
    high quality simulator is also available separately.  Although not
    freeware, the low price ($100), the features, all of the extra
    goodies, and the good reviews make this a package worth looking at.
    Also, if you're interested in working on more than one family of
    microcontroller, Dunfield supports a wide range.  This means only
    needing to learn one system, instead of many.


4.3)  Commercially available products

    Many firms (large and small) offer a variety of 8051 microcontroller
    variants, programming languages, support packages, and development
    systems.

    No endorsement is implied by inclusion in this list.  I apologize to
    anyone I left out;  It's only because I didn't know about you.  If
    you want to be included in this list, just drop me a line - please.
    Any corrections and additions appreciated.

        - If you're the type that watched Gilligan's Island for its

          just crossed my desk - Inquisitor Magazine.  It's general
          philosophy seems to be ... well, it seems to be ... uh, yeah!
          Technical in nature, bizarre, tongue in cheek, eclectic,
          electric, did I mention bizarre(?), and lots of fun.  Worth
          looking at if you like the out of the ordinary.  The moving

5.2.2)  Book reviews

    Jan Axelson's review of her book:
    The Microcontroller Idea Book


       This is a hands-on guide that presents designs for use in data
       loggers, controllers, and other small-computer projects.  It
       includes complete circuit schematics and parts lists, design
       theory, example program listings, construction and debugging tips,
       and vendor listings.  Example circuits and programs are based on
       the 8052-BASIC microcontroller.  The book is loosely based on a
       series of articles I wrote for ComputerCraft magazine (now The
       Microcomputer Journal).

       Chapter titles:  microcontroller basics, inside the 8052-
       BASIC, powering up, saving programs, programming, inputs and
       outputs, switches and keypads, displays, using sensors to
       detect and measure, clocks and calendars, control circuits,
       wireless links, calling assembly-language routines, running
       BASIC-52 from external memory, related products


    Richard H. Barnett's summary of his book:
    The 8051 Family of Microcontrollers

       The book covers basic micros through complete projects using the
       8051 family as examples.  It is designed as a "lots of meat, very
       little filler" type of text, but is very well-suited for use as a
       handbook of project development using 8051 family parts.  The book
       stresses examples, both hardware and software.  The hardware
       examples are real working items including 3 complete projects in
       the last chapter.  Software examples are presented in both C and
       assembly code.  All of the program listings and other software
       examples were imported electronically to the text eliminating
       errors.

    Richard Kendrick's review of the book:
    8051 Interfacing and Applications
    from Applied Logic Engineering

       IN BRIEF

       An excellent collection of interfacing circuits and well commented
       source code in assembly.  This is not a book for beginners as it
       assumes the user is very familiar with the architecture of the
       8051 and its registers.  A disk of assembly source code listings
       is included.

       COMMENTS

       This spiral bound book is thin (74 pages) but manages to cover a
       lot of information.  All of the sub-chapters have excellent code
       listings with full comments, partial schematic diagrams, and an
       occasional timing diagram.  The chapter on using the serial port
       is based on the MAX232 chip becoming so popular.  A table of timer
       reload values is provided to get standard baud rates but the book
       only mentions the required clock frequency of 11.0592 mHz in the
       first chapter.  It also doesn't explain why a seemingly
       non-standard crystal frequency was chosen.  The dual UART channel
       features the 2681 chip.  The LCD chapter gives a small but
       adequate explaination of the Hitachi controller chip usage on LCD
       displays and a tiny fragment of data on display characteristics of
       LCDs.  The bank selection of memory is useful showing code and
       schematic using five 62256 chips for 160K bytes of read/write
       memory.



    Richard Kendrick's review of the book:
    Microprocessor/Controller Design
    by Wayne P. Lichti of Business Data Computers

       A lame little book better bypassed.  As an introductory text,
       Kenneth Ayala's book is the winner hands down.  This book is a
       poor rehash of the same information in Intel's or AMD's data book.
       There is one code listing in the book and does little more than
       tell the reader that the 8051 family of processors exist.

       This book is 134 pages of wasted time.  The schematics were
       printed on a dot matrix printer and poorly reproduced.  Many of
       the sections are just a table or a paragraph with two or three
       sentences.  Use Ayala's book, you'll learn a lot more useful
       information.


    John Little's review of the book:
    The 8051 Microcontroller: Architecture, Programming and Applications
    by Kenneth J. Ayala

       IN BRIEF

       A good book for those who are already moderately familiar with
       assembly language programming and wish to learn more about 8051
       specifics.  Has many example listings, all of which are very well
       documented in terms of comments and explanations in the text. NOT
       a book for absolute beginners OR hardware hackers looking for
       circuits and applications.

       COMMENTS

       In his preface to the book, Mr Ayala states that that it is
       intended for "... a diverse audience. It is meant for use
       primarily by those who work in the area of electronic design and
       assembly language programming of small, dedicated computers".
       Later, he goes on to refer the reader to the manufacturer's data
       books for more information on hardware issues. This sets the tone
       for the whole book, which is very much software orientated.

       Anyone buying the book expecting to find reams of circuit diagrams
       and details on how to build their own 8051 driven, automated car
       assembly plant will be disappointed. In fact, most of the circuits
       and applications shown are very much conceptual, with generic,
       black-box outlines for most of the components. The single
       exception to this is a fairly complete system (8031, EPROM &#38; RAM,
       jumper selectable memory sizes) in the chapter on microcontroller
       design.  Even then, there's no I/O shown (the txd/rxd are
       unconnected).

       Having said that, Mr Ayala does do a fairly thorough job of
       working through the peculiarities of the 8051, with detailed
       coverage of memory organisation, bit/byte level operations,
       timers, interrupts and, at the end of the book, a complete chapter
       on 8051 communication modes. Each area has relevant assembly
       language listings, along with a detailed explanation of the
       workings of the code.

       Each section also has highlighted "comment" passages which point
       out common pitfalls and reinforce critical points. Each chapter
       ends with a summary of the important points covered and a series
       of ten to twenty pertinent problems for the reader to solve. For
       the most part, the answers to the problems can be found in the
       text.  In later chapters though, the reader is asked to elaborate
       on various programming themes and to write assembly language
       programs of their own to perform various tasks. The problems range
       from the bland "Name twenty items which have a built in
       microcontroller" (Chapter 1), to the more esoteric "Compose a
       40-value lookup table that will generate a sawtooth wave using a
       D/A converter" (Chapter 8).

       It should be noted that the book is not aimed at the complete
       novice. For instance, although assembly language listings are used
       throughout, it is not until Appendix B that the reader finds out
       what the assembler actually does and how the listings relate to
       machine code. Even then, the complete neophyte will be left with a
       rather empty feeling, as there are pages and pages of code, the
       schematic for a (more or less) complete system and instructions on
       how to use the assembler, but no information at all on how the
       object code should be utilised (other than with the included
       simulator - see below). If you don't already know how to blow an
       EPROM, you're in trouble.

       The diskette which accompanies the book contains the PseudoSam
       assembler (which is used throughout) and an 8051 simulator. Both
       being intended for use on a PC (it's a measure of how fast the
       computer industry is evolving that a 5.25 inch diskette seems a
       little archaic just three years after the publication date of the
       book).  The PseudoSam assembler ran fine on my system and I was
       able to assemble several of the examples from the book and
       successfully run them on a small, home-brew 8031 system. I was
       totally unable to get the simulator to run. However, as it failed
       on several different systems I'm prepared to believe that my
       particular copy of the diskette was at fault.


       SUMMARY

       All in all, a recommended book for those who have previous
       assembly language experience and wish to get to know details
       relating to the 8051 microcontroller. While the internal
       architecture of the chip is covered in detail, external hardware
       and peripheral interfacing is not.  Only the basic 8051/31 is
       covered, with little mention of the other variants available.
       There are extensive listings in the text, covering routines for
       handling keyboards and displays, as well as timing loops and
       communications. A large, clear typeface ensures that all of the
       listings are completely legible. The layout and presentation of
       the book is excellent, with a consistent, unambiguous style used
       throughout.


    Tim McDonough's review of the book:
    C and the 8051: Programming for Multitasking
    by Thomas W. Schultz

       Schultz's book provides a brief overview of the 8051 architecture
       but is primarily a discussion of multi-tasking software in an 8051
       environment.  He presents quite a few code examples.  The examples
       and the accompanying text show comparisons of how to accomplish
       things in assembler, PLM, and C.  The C examples presented are
       based on Version 3 of the Franklin compiler but should be easily
       understandable by anyone already familiar with C.

       Later chapters in the book deal with more advanced topics.
       Chapters are devoted to Real-Time Ideas, Timing and Scheduling,
       Communications and Synchronization, Interrupts, Priority, and
       Context, and Distributed Systems.  The Real-Time Ideas chapter
       briefly discusses six Real Time Operating System (RTOS) kernels
       offered by several vendors.  Later in the book some examples are
       given to simple applications with and without using a RTOS.

       All in all, a useful addition to my technical library.  It is one
       of the few 8051 books that goes beyond the basics and would be
       particularly of interest to those contemplating their first
       non-trivial 8051 design.
