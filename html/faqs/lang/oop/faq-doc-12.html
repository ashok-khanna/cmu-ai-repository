        We are pleased to announce the release of new object oriented
language based on C.  The language has support for concurrent object
execution with synchronous or asynchronous message pssaing and wait when
necessary reply handling.  The language known as cooC (concurrent object
oriented C) is available by anonymous FTP for research purposes.

        FTP Site:  tsbgw.isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp (133.196.1.11)
        File: pub/toshiba/cooc-beta.1.1.tar.Z

        The released version of cooC employs SunOS(TM) LWP (light weight
process), to obtain concurrent execution.  The release consists of the
language translator (cooC-&#62;C), a runtime library (SunOS(TM)), a
concurrent object based debbuger, an example groupware application
(SharedDraw) and some technical papers.

BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
ANY PART OF THE SYSTEM.

        TOSHIBA Corporation while making cooC free for research, retains

&#62;6  FMPL (prototyping)

What: Interpreter for FMPL of Accardi, Release 1
From: blojo@xcf.berkeley.edu (Jon Blow)
Date: 2 Jun 92 08:42:26 GMT

An interpreter for FMPL of Accardi, Release 1 is now available for ftp at 
xcf.berkeley.edu:src/local/fmpl/.

*FMPL is a prototype-based object-oriented programming language.
*FMPL possesses lambda-calculus based constructs.
*FMPL is an event-driven language; the events it responds to are mainly
based on the behavior of input/output streams, not only within the unix domain
but across the internet as well.
*FMPL supports "pretty"-printing of internally-represented code back into
readable form.
*FMPL is an experimental language developed at the Experimental Computing 
Facility of the University of California, Berkeley.  This release is something
of a beta test since the language has not been widely used outside Berkeley.
It is hoped that this release will draw useful comments and suggestions from
the world at large that will help in improving future versions of FMPL.
