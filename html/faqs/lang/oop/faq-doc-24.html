 Yes, the Law of Demeter paper is available in electronic form on the
 net. Indeed, many of the Demeter project papers are available from
 the ftp server at Northeastern University (see instructions below).

 The Law of Demeter idea has been automated in the Demeter Tools/C++
 as an adaptive software tool which automatically makes much of your C++ code
 compliant with the Law of Demeter. The tool is an add-on tool to
 your favorite C++ development environment and is commercially available
 from Demeter International. The Demeter Tools/C++ lift
 object-oriented programming to a higher level of abstraction
 by allowing the user to focus on the essential and
 stable classes. A paper on ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE will appear in 
 the Communications of the ACM and is also available from the
 ftp server.
