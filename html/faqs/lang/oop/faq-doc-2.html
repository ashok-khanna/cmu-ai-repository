  something like an Object Broker, but it is *not* CORBA compatible (yet).
  Electra is a research project and not available yet.

  Its a toolkit for building failure resilient, distributed applications
  in C++. It supports object-groups, virtual synchrony, multithreading
  etc. Electra is based on the HORUS toolkit (which is "the new ISIS
  implementation" developed at Cornell, Ithaca NY.)
  An overview paper to electra is available from:
  ftp.ifi.unizh.ch: pub/techreports/electra.ps.Z


&#62; HD_DOMS

HD-DOMS (HyperDesk Distributed Object Management System).  A
CORBA-compliant DOMS.  Includes a GUI API driver for prototyping and
exercising objects, a bundled object database for persistent object
storage, a Kerberos-based authentication service, a location service, a
set of base classes to speed development, and a test script language.
Revision 1.0 has been shipping since beginning of '92.  Revision 1.1
(which includes support for CORBA's static client interface) is available
now, and a NetWare version is in the works.  Submitted a C++ language
mapping for IDL to the OMG recently.
