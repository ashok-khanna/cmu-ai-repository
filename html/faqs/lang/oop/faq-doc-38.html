                        REPORTS AVAILABLE FROM
             THE DISTRIBUTED OBJECT COMPUTING DEPARTMENT
                     GTE LABORATORIES INCORPORATED
                        40 Sylvan Road, M/S 62
                     Waltham, Massachusetts 02254


For over six years, the primary focus of the Distributed Object Computing
Department within GTE Laboratories has been the Distributed Object
Management (DOM) project. The DOM project conducts research into
object-oriented technology for integrating heterogeneous, autonomous,
distributed (HAD) computer systems/resources. Major research areas include:
interoperable object models; interoperable, distributed object
architectures; heterogeneous, extended transaction models; and information
requests in HAD environments. We are experimenting in these areas using our
prototype DOM system which we have developed over the past five years. This
technology is based on ideas from a number of technical areas including
distributed, object-oriented, databases, multi-database systems, operating
systems, and programming languages.
