Hi there,

since I've never seen 'Symbolics' or 'Statice' in
comp.database.object, this might be interesting:

A few days ago, Symbolics announced the availability of a beta-
release of their ODBMS 'Statice' on Unix platforms. It is quite
powerful and tightly integrated within Common Lisp.
Currently, Symbolics and LUCID are supported.
People (like me) used to Symbolics' Genera development environment 
can continue to use Statice there (where it has been already
successfully employed in 'real world' applications)
and now also use it on Unix Workstations.  (Those are the cheaper
boxes, I guess). Both kinds of platforms can be freely intermixed
in a network.

Statice is based on standards of Lisp: CLOS and CLIM 
(Common Lisp Object System, resp. Common Lisp Interface Manager)

Here's the address of Symbolics in Germany; they're mostly 
responsible for Statice on Unix:

Symbolics Systemhaus GmbH
Mergenthalerallee 77
6236 Eschborn (til June 31)
65760 Eschborn (from July 1)
Tel. (49) 6196-47220, Fax (49) 6196-481116

Contact person is Dr. Thomas Neumann (TN@symbolics.de).

Also:

"Update Database Schema" brings an existing database into conformance
with a modified schema.  Changes are classified as either compatible
(lossless, i.e., completely information-preserving) or incompatible
(i.e., potentially information-losing in the current implementation).
Basically, any change is compatible except for the following:

    -- If an attribute's type changes, all such attributes extant
    are re-initialized (nulled out).  Note that Statice permits
    an attribute to be of type T, the universal type.  Such an
    attribute can then take on any value without schema
    modification or information loss.

    -- If a type's inheritance (list of parents) changes, the
    type must be deleted and re-created, losing all extant
    instances of that type. This is Statice's most serious
    current limitation.  The simplest workaround is to employ a
    database dumper/loader (either the one supplied by Symbolics
    or a customized one) to save the information elements and
    then reload them into the modified schema.

&#62; UniSQL

UniSQL offers a state-of-the-art suite of integrated object-oriented database
systems and application development products which can be used separately or
together to support complex development projects which use object-oriented
development techniques, integrate sophisticated multimedia data, and require
true multidatabase access to relational and object-oriented databases. The
UniSQL product suite includes:

        UniSQL/X Database Management System;
        UniSQL/M Multidatabase System; and
        UniSQL/4GE Application Development Environment
        User interfaces include: C++, C, Object SQL, SmallTalk, and ODBC
        Database interfaces include: Ingres, Oracle, Sybase, UniSQL/X, and EDA/SQL

UniSQL offers:

- A wide selection of user interfaces including C++, SmallTalk, C, Microsoft's
  ODBC, both embedded (static and dynamic) and interactive Object SQL, and UniSQL
  and 3rd-party development tools.

- Mission-critical database features such as a high-level query language
  (SQL/X), cost-based query optimization, automatic transaction management,
  automatic concurrency control, dynamic schema evolution, dynamic authorization,
  physical disk structuring options, and installation tuning parameters.

- The UniSQL Multimedia Framework which provides natural and uniform database
  system support for all types of large unstructured data objects. The Multimedia
  Framework also provides for seamless integration of multimedia devices such as
  fax machines, CD jukeboxes, satellite feeds, image compression boards, etc.

- The UniSQL/M Multidatabase System enables developers to manage a collection
  of multi-vendor databases -- Ingres, Oracle, Sybase, DB2, UniSQL/X, and others
  -- as a single federated database system with full object-oriented
  capabilities.

UniSQL has well over 150 customers around the world, the majority of which are
using UniSQL database products for mission-critical applications which require
object-oriented, multimedia, post-relational, and heterogeneous database
capabilities.

A typical UniSQL customer is a Fortune 500 company, a commercial software
developer, or government organization that is using UniSQL database products
to:

- support mission-critical application development projects which are being
  developed using object-oriented programming languages and development
  techniques,

- support applications which must integrate many different types of corporate
  data -- text and documents, tabular data, images and audio, engineering
  drawings, GIS data, procedural data (programs), etc. -- into a single
  application context.

- support the full object-oriented development paradigm using existing
  relational database systems such as Ingres, Oracle, Sybase, and DB2.

- logically integrate one or more relational and object-oriented databases to
  form a single, homogenized database server which supports both relational and
  object-oriented facilities.

In September 1992, UniSQL was selected by the Petrotechnical Open Software
Corporation (POSC) -- over more than 25 other industry vendors -- to provide
database technology which is being used by POSC in their development of a new
data management specification for the oil &#38; gas industry. Also during 1992,
because of its powerful multimedia capabilities, UniSQL was selected by the MIT
AthenaMuse Consortium on multimedia as the consortium's multimedia database
system.

During the DB/EXPO '93 Conference and Exhibition, UniSQL was chosen in
competition with major industry database vendors as a finalist in the
``RealWare Awards''.  The ``RealWare Awards'' honor companies that have
had a major impact in the user community.

UniSQL was founded in May 1990 by Dr. Won Kim, President and CEO, delivering
the UniSQL/X DBMS in March of 1992. With its world-class database research and
architectural team, UniSQL has perfected what the database industry has sought
since the mid-1980s: a fully object-oriented data model that is a natural
conceptual outgrowth of the popular relational model. Both the UniSQL/X DBMS
and the UniSQL/M Multidatabase System represent the first of a powerful new
generation of client-server database systems that support the full
object-oriented paradigm yet retain all of the strengths and capabilities of
relational database systems including support for ANSI-standard SQL.

UniSQL currently has 45 employees and is privately owned and managed by Dr.
Kim. The company has secured long-term funding from NTT Data Communications
Systems Corp. (NTT Data), a $2 billion company, which is Japan's foremost
systems integrator and UniSQL's exclusive distributor in Japan.
