       u++ - uC++ Translator and Concurrency Runtime System

DESCRIPTION
The u++ command introduces  a  translator  pass  over  the
specified source files after the C preprocessor and before
the actual C++ compilation.  The translator converts  sev-
eral  new  uC++  constructs  into C++ statements.  The u++
command also provides  the  runtime  concurrency library,
which must be linked with each uC++ application.
