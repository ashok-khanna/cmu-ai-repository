             DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING PRODUCTS OVERVIEW

  There was a recent posting concerning the relationship between OMG's CORBA
 and Distributed Transaction Processing Monitors. In general, there is a lot of
 uncertainty as to how the various distributed computing tools, products and
 environments might work together.  Below is the outline of an eight-page
 posting to the Corporate Facilitators of  Object-Oriented Technology (CFOOT)
 mailing list addressing these issues. Let me know if you would like a copy
 of the posting and/or to be added to the CFOOT mailing list.

3.13) What Is The MVC Framework?
--------------------------------

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.  This framework was originally adopted
in Smalltalk to support Graphical User Interfaces.  Views support graphical
interfacing, controllers handle interaction, and models are the application
objects.  More details and references will be included in future FAQs.

"A Cookbook for Using the Model-View-Controller User Interface Paradigm in
Smalltalk-80".  G. E. Krasner and S. T. Pope.  JOOP, vol 1, no 3, August/
September, 1988, pp 26-49,


3.14) What is Real-Time?
------------------------

Real-time is our linear extrapolation/perception of imaginary time.

[This section is YTBI]


SECTION 4:  COMMONLY ASKED LANGUAGE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
======================================================

4.1)  What is Downcasting?
--------------------------

Downcasting is the term used in C++ for casting a pointer or reference to
a base class to a derived class.  This should usually be checked with an
embedded dynamic typing scheme if such a scheme is not present in the
language, such as with a typecase (Modula-3) or inspect (Simula) construct.
In C++, it is even possible to use conversion functions to perform some
checks, although the proposed RTTI will perform checked downcasting as
its primary ability.


4.2)  What are Virtual Functions?
---------------------------------

Look under "Dynamic Binding" and "Polymorphism".


4.3)  Can I Use Multiple-Polymorphism Or Multi-Methods In C++?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, but you'll need to embed a dynamic typing scheme to do it.  With dynamic
types in place, an overriding method in a derived class can explicitly check
argument types in a switch statement and invoke the desired method emulating
multiple-polymorphism [See Coplien 92].  

For true CLOS multi-methods, the above technique implemented as a base function
(CLOS defgeneric), switching to specialized functions (CLOS methods, made
friends of all arguments) will provide the functional calling syntax, multiple-
polymorphism and access to parameters found in CLOS.  This can require some
complex switching, which is somewhat mitigated when multiple-polymorphism
is implemented with virtual functions.

Future FAQs should contain more detail.


4.4)  Can I Use Dynamic Inheritance In C++?
-------------------------------------------

Yes, [Coplien 92] describes a scheme where a class can contain a pointer to
a base class that can switch between its derived classes, providing a limited
form.  Earlier chapters contain entries on bypassing C++'s message system and
even bypassing static linking.

Future FAQs should contain more detail.

   "... an object is automatically an instance of a predicate class whenever
   it satisfies a predicate expression associated with the predicate class.
   The predicate expression can test the value or state of the object, thus
   supporting a form of implicit property-based classification that augments
   the explicit type-based classification provided by normal classes.  By
   associating methods with predicate classes, method lookup can depend not
   only on the dynamic class of an argument but also on its dynamic value or
   state. [...] A version of predicate classes has been designed and
   implemented in the context of the Cecil language.

 Method.  Prentice-Hall Object-Oriented Series. ISBN 0-13-338823-9

  Fusion is considered to be a second generation OOAD method in that it builds
  on successful components of a number of first generation methods (OMT, Booch,
  CRC, Objectory, etc).  However, this has been done with the requirements of
  industrial software developers in mind. And so issues of traceability,
  management etc. have been taken into consideration and the Method provides
  full coverage from requirements through to code.

  Its primary purpose is to indicate how information engineering (IE) can be 
  evolved to accommodate OO.  The analysis portion (starting at Chapter 15) 
  attempts to go back to 'first principles' and is based on a formal foundation.
  Therefore, the IE aspect is not required.  Emphasis is more on analysis than 
  design.

================

These are individuals whose names appear in comp.object most often. 
Please send recommendations for *major* VIPS often cited or referenced.

Booch, Grady &#60;egb@rational.com&#62;
-------------------------------

Grady Booch has been an object-oriented Ada advocate for some time.  He's
written books such as Software Engineering with Ada, Software Components
with Ada, and OOD with Applications.  The first two are Object-Based and
the second is primarily Object-Oriented and all use OB and OO notations and
methodologies.  His last notations are often referred to as simply the
"Booch" method or notation and his company, Rational, provides automated
support with a tool named "Rose".  See also APPENDIX D.


Cox, Brad
---------

Founder of Objective-C, which grafts the Smalltalk facilities of an
Object id and a messaging mechanism onto C.  Author of [Cox 87].


Goldberg, Adele  (Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls)
----------------------------------------

One of the founders of Smalltalk (with Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls).  Coauthor
of [Goldberg 83, ??], "Smalltalk-80 The Language and its Implementation".
Smalltalk was invented by a group at Xerox PARC; and a spinoff, ParcPlace, is
now marketing Smalltalk environments (see APPENDIX C).


Meyer, Bertrand &#60;bertrand@eiffel.com&#62;
-------------------------------------

Founder of Eiffel, author of [Meyer 88].  Often posts to comp.lang.eiffel
and comp.object [what a FAQ writer notices].  His company, Interactive
Software Engineering, has a case tool called EiffelCase (see APPENDIX D).


Nygaard, Krysten (and Dahl, Ole-Johan)
--------------------------------------

Inventor of Simula, the first object-oriented programming language.  Also
inventor of object oriented design, for which Simula-67 was considered an
implementation technique.  Now B.B. Kristensen, O.L. Madsen, B. Moller-
Pedersen, and K. Nygaard are working on Beta, their successor to Simula.


Rumbaugh, James
---------------

Part of Rumbaugh, Blaha, Premerlani, Eddy and Lorenson, the authors of
[Rumbaugh 91].  They all work for GE Corporate Research and Development Center
in Schenectady New York and have an OOA/OOD notation/methodology called the
"Object Modeling Technique".  It is a rather formal and complete method often
discussed in comp.object.  OMTool is the name of the CASE system provided by
GE which supports OMT.  See APPENDIX D.


Shlaer, Sally (and Mellor, Stephen J.)
--------------------------------------

&#62;Sally Shlaer            sally@projtech.com

This is a list of available Object-Oriented databases.  Thanks go to Stewart
Clamen, who's survey on schema evolution provided a good start.  Additional
short entries are encouraged; please send additions to the author of the FAQ
(and/or to Stewart).

The most recent copy of Stewart Clamen's summary on available databases
support for schema evolution will be available indefinitely via anonymous
FTP from <A NAME=id11 HREF="ftp://byron.sp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/anon/OODBMS/evolution-summary">BYRON.SP.CS.CMU.EDU:/usr/anon/OODBMS/evolution-summary</A>.

EXTENDED RELATIONAL DB MODEL
----------------------------

&#62; POSTGRES (Berkeley)

POSTGRES is an extended-relational database manager that supports
inheritance, user-defined types, functions, and operators, ad-hoc
queries, time travel, a rules system, tertiary storage devices,
and very large typed objects, among other things.  POSTGRES speaks
postquel, a derivative of the quel query language originally
designed at berkeley for the ingres database system.  User functions
may be written in C or in postquel.  C functions will be dynamically
loaded into the database server on demand, and either kind of function
may be executed from the query language.

POSTGRES and the papers that describe it are available free of charge
from toe.CS.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.149.117) in directory pub/postgres.
The code is stored in a directory named after the latest release; at
the time of this writing, that directory is postgres-v4r1.  The list
of officially-supported ports is short (decstations running ultrix 4.x
and sparcstations).  Unofficially, many more are supported -- people
elsewhere have done the ports and distribute their versions of the
code.  The list of unofficial ports is available in pub/postgres as
file UNOFFICIAL-PORT-LIST.

On Type Evolution:
You ask explicitly about type evolution.  We support schema
modification on all classes, including user classes.  This means that
you can add attributes (instance slots) and methods at any time.
Further, since postgres is a shared database system, such changes are
instantly visible to any other user of the class.

The language syntax supports attribute deletion, but the system won't
do it yet.  Since all data is persistent, removing attributes from a
class requires some work -- you need to either get rid of or ignore
all the values you've already stored.

The postgres code from uc berkeley is being commercialized by
Miro Systems, Inc.        [This seems to have been updated to Montage]
