A lot of people have requested this software!  You can now get Tags for
C/C++ version 1.0 via anonymous ftp at:

        <A NAME=id58 HREF="ftp://ftp.centerline.com/pub/tags-1.0.tar.Z">ftp.centerline.com:/pub/tags-1.0.tar.Z</A>

ftp.centerline.com is 140.239.2.29.  Anonymous ftp means login as "ftp" and
give your email address as the password.

If you don't have ftp access to the internet, you may want to wait for this
stuff to come out in comp.sources.unix.  Or, if you plan to use it right away,
send me a letter that says "I can't use ftp; please send by email" and I will
do so.
