     This article contains the answers to some Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) often seen in comp.lang.prolog.  It is posted
(twice a month, currently on the 1st and 16th) to help reduce
volume in this newsgroup and to provide hard-to-find information
of general interest.

     This article includes answers to the following questions.

0. General information
1. What is the Association for Logic Programming?
2. Where can I get a public-domain, free Prolog for (the IBM PC,
   the Mac, Unix)?

   available for a price from research institutions?
4. How do I get in touch with my Prolog's users' group,
   sales representative, or technical support line?
5. I think language X is better than Prolog.  What do you think?

0. General information

     The newsgroup "comp.lang.prolog" discusses the language
Prolog and other "logic programming" languages.  Logic
programming languages, in general, are programming languages
which incorporate some of the language of mathematical logic;
unification and backtracking search are common operational
features.  For more background information about Prolog, see the
list of books in Question 7 of this list.

2. Where can I get a public-domain, free Prolog for (the IBM PC,
   the Mac, Unix)?

     The following are anonymous-FTP sites for free Prologs
which are either in the public domain or are "copy-lefted"
(permitted to be copied with some restrictions on commercial use).

     [Please see Mark Kantrowitz's monthly "Prolog Resource
Guide" posting (see question 3) for information about non-free
implementations.]

     (Please note that for extensive development work, users
will probably want a robust interpreter or compiler with good
debugging facilities and a standard syntax, among other things.
While public-domain systems are a valuable service to the
community, they do not necessarily have all these things, and
users should weigh carefully what they want to do against the
capabilities and costs of the available systems.)

3. What commercial systems are available?  What about systems
   available for a price from research institutions?

     Many commercial systems are listed in the periodically
posted Prolog Resource Guide.  The Resource Guide also lists
many systems which are not exactly "commercial", but available
for a price from research instutitions.  The list of such
systems was originally compiled by Chris Moss, of Imperial
College.  The rest of the Resource Guide was originally compiled
by Dag Wahlberg, of Uppsala University.

     The Resource Guide is now maintained by the kind efforts
of Mark Kantrowitz, "Mark.Kantrowitz@GLINDA.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU", who
posts it ON THE 14TH OF EVERY MONTH on comp.lang.prolog.  It is
also available by anonymous FTP from "ftp.cs.cmu.edu" [128.2.206.173]
in the directory "/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mkant/Public/AI/", as the
file "prolog-resource-guide.text".

     Readers should also note that the newly formed Prolog
Vendors' Group is contactable electronically via the Secretary,
Al Roth.  His email is "alroth@cix.compulink.co.uk".

5. I think language X is better than Prolog.  What do you think?

     These debates rarely result in any productive discussion.
To some extent, one's favourite language is based on irrational
ideology.

     However, many people now agree that different languages are
good for different things.  Prolog seems to be good for problems
in which logic is intimately involved, or whose solutions have a
succinct logical characterization.  Like other interactive,
symbolic languages, Prolog is also good for rapid prototyping.

     Also, please note that there are many different "Prologs"
and other logic programming languages available, all with
different capabilities.

6. My Prolog prof assigned me this problem.  Can you help
   me with it?

     If your instructor assigned it to you, he or she probably
wanted you to do it yourself.  If it's an introductory Prolog
course, your question might be elementary to most readers, so it
might be a waste of network resources to ask it.  Please ask
your instructor, a friend, a teaching assistant, or a local
newsgroup for help first.

     That being said, there are comp.lang.prolog readers who
would be glad to help people making a legitimate attempt to
learn Prolog.

			*	*	*

7. Can you suggest some books on Prolog?

     The Prolog Resource Guide (see above, question 3) contains
a listing of Prolog books.  It is maintained by Mark Kantrowitz
(Mark.Kantrowitz@GLINDA.OZ.CS.CMU.EDU), and posted periodically
on comp.lang.prolog.

     Here are some of the most popular books on Prolog.

_Programming in Prolog_.  William F. Clocksin and Christopher S.
Mellish.  Springer-Verlag, 1987.  (Introductory.)

_The Art of Prolog:  Advanced Programming Techniques_.  Leon
Sterling and Ehud Shapiro.  MIT Press, 1986.  (Advanced.)

_The Craft of Prolog_.  Richard A. O'Keefe.  MIT Press, 1990.
(Advanced.)

_Foundations of Logic Programming_.  John Lloyd. 
Springer-Verlag, 1988 (2nd ed).  (Logic programming theory.)

			*	*	*

8. Are there any FTP archive sites for comp.lang.prolog?

     Yes.  As of the latest check, the following archive sites
contain selected recent articles from comp.lang.prolog in the
indicated directories.

"cs.dal.ca": /pub/comp.archives/comp.lang.prolog
"info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de":
  /pub/comm/news/archive/comp.archives/auto/comp.lang.prolog

     Some other sites contain copies of this FAQ list and the
Prolog Resource Guide (see question 3).  For users with "archie"
access, type "archie comp.lang.prolog" for an up-to-date list of
sites having either archives or the periodic postings.

			*	*	*

9. How can I get a copy of the draft ISO Prolog standard?
   Where can I go for more information about it?

     You can pick up a copy by anonymous FTP from site
"ai.uga.edu", directory "/pub/prolog.standard".  The directory
also contains a summary of the standard, by Michael Covington,
in the "isoprolog" files.  Note that no one at that site can
answer any questions about the standard; it is just an FTP site
for the standard in the USA.

     A copy of Richard O'Keefe's Prolog standard draft from 1984
is available from "ftp.ecrc.de", file /pub/eclipse/std/plstd.doc".

     For more information about the ISO Prolog standard, contact

DITC/93,  National Physical Laboratory

Fax: +44 81 977 7091
E-mail: rss@seg.npl.co.uk

10. How does the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine) work?  How do I
   write a WAM-based compiler or a WAM emulator?

     Reportedly the best tutorial is Hassan Ait-Kaci's book
_Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction_ (MIT
Press, 1991).  A public-domain WAM emulator, written in C++ by
Herve Touati, is available by anonymous FTP at site
"gatekeeper.dec.com", in directory "pub/plan/prolog/ucb".

			*	*	*

11. Is there a WWW (World Wide Web) page on logic programming?

     Yes, there is one by Jonathan Bowen; the URL is
"<A NAME=id HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/logic-prog.html">http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/logic-prog.html</A>".
He invites us to mail him at "bowen@comlab.ox.ac.uk" with any
relevant information for inclusion.
