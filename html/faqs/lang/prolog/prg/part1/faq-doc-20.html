<H1>[1-19] The ISO Standard for Prolog and other Prolog standards</H1>
<PRE>
The ISO standard for Prolog is ISO/IEC 13211-1:1995. Copies can be
purchased from national standards bodies (e.g. ANSI, AFNOR, DIN). 
It defines the core features of Prolog: part 2, in preparation, 
will define modules. ISO does not currently make standards available 
by anonymous FTP, but the 1993 draft ISO standard for Prolog is
available by anonymous FTP from
   <A NAME=id92 HREF="ftp://ai.uga.edu/pub/prolog.standard/">ai.uga.edu:/pub/prolog.standard/</A> [128.192.12.9]
An unofficial summary of the ISO Prolog standard is available
from the same location as isoprolog.tex or isoprolog.ps.Z.  Send mail
to Michael Covington &#60;mcovingt@ai.uga.edu&#62; for more information about
his summary of the standard. 

A PostScript version of the August 1995 draft for Part 2 is
available from
   <A NAME=id93 HREF="http://www.sju.edu/~jhodgson/x3j17.html">http://www.sju.edu/~jhodgson/x3j17.html</A>
