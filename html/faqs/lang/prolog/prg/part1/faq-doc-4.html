A BiBTeX bibliography of Logic Programming Conferences is available by
anonymous ftp from duck.dfki.uni-sb.de. See [1-5] below.

A partially annotated bibliography of work on integrating
object-oriented and logic programming is available by anonymous ftp
from <A NAME=id15 HREF="ftp://menaik.cs.ualberta.ca/pub/oolog/">menaik.cs.ualberta.ca:/pub/oolog/</A> in PostScript and BibTeX

   186 papers, ISBN 0-387-97315-X hardcover ($38).
   Teaches Prolog by leading the reader through the construction of an
   adventure game. The exercises lead the reader through three other
   programs:  an intelligent database, an expert system and an order-entry
   program.  While most texts teach Prolog with fragments of interesting code,
   this book takes a more pragmatic (as opposed to theoretical approach) and
   shows the reader how to assemble complete Prolog programs.
