<H1>[2-9] Other Commercial Prolog Products</H1>
<PRE>
ClauseDB is a database manager for Prolog data.  Advanced
knowledge-based applications often need to use a large number of
highly complex data objects. The objects are so complex that they
cannot be managed in a standard commercial RDB product, and the number
of them makes it impractical to store them in the standard Prolog
in-memory database. ClauseDB may also be useful even in Prolog
applications whose data can be handled in a RDB. The retrieval
procedure of ClauseDB is integrated in the Prolog search method. This
avoids the performance problems that arise with the standard scheme
for coupling Prolog with a RDBM (e.g., those caused by the well-known
mismatch problem between tuple- and set-based retrieval methods).
ClauseDB supports all the normal Prolog data objects (arbitrary terms
and clauses) and provides a locking mechanism that allows the sharing
of data while ensuring its integrity. ClauseDB 2.0 is available on
SUN SPARC (SunOS 4.x and 5.x) and the INTEL PC running Solaris 2.x.
