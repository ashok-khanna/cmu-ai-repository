<PRE>
This section contains commercial parallel Prolog and logic programming
implementations. 

Densitron CS Prolog is a parallel prolog compiler and interpreter for
IBM PCs (MS-DOS or OS/2), T414/T800 transputer (mono or multi), 386
(Unix V), uVAX (VMS), or VAX(VMS). Also standard Prolog for MS-DOS,
UNIX and VAX. For more information, write to Densitron, Unit 4,
