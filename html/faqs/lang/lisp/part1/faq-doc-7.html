<PRE>
Glossary of acronyms:
   CAR             Originally meant "Contents of Address portion of Register",
                   which is what CAR actually did on the IBM 704.
   CDR             Originally meant "Contents of Decrement portion of 
                   Register", which is what CDR actually did
                   on the IBM 704. Pronounced "Cudder" /kUdd@r/ (as in "a cow
                   chews its cdr"). The first syllable is pronounced
                   like "could". 
   LISP            Originally from "LISt Processing"
   GUI             Graphical User Interface
   CLOS            Common Lisp Object System. The object oriented
                   programming standard for Common Lisp. Based on
                   Symbolics FLAVORS and Xerox LOOPS, among others.
                   Pronounced either as "See-Loss" or "Closs". See also PCL.
   PCL             Portable Common Loops. A portable CLOS implementation.
                   Available by anonymous ftp from parcftp.xerox.com:pcl/.
   LOOPS           Lisp Object Oriented Programming System. A predecessor
                   to CLOS on Xerox Lisp machines.
   X3J13           Subcommittee of the ANSI committee X3 which is
                   working on the ANSI Standardization of Common Lisp.
   ANSI            American National Standards Institute
   dpANS           draft proposed American National Standard (what an ANS
                   is called while it's in the public review stage of
                   standardization).
   CL              Common Lisp
   SC22/WG16       The full name is ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 16. It stands
                   for International Organization for Standardization/
                   International Electrotechnical Commission, Joint
                   Technical Committee 1 Subcommittee 22 (full name
                   "Information Technology -- Programming Languages
                   and their Environments"), Working Group 16.  This
                   long-winded name is the ISO working group working
                   on an international Lisp standard, (i.e., the ISO
                   analogue to X3J13). 
   CLtL1           First edition of Guy Steele's book, 
                   "Common Lisp the Language". 
   CLtL2           Second edition of Guy Steele's book,
                   "Common Lisp the Language".
