<H1>[6-0] General information about FTP Resources for Lisp</H1>
<PRE>
Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .z, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .z suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from:
   <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/</A>
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

FTP sites for Lisp and Scheme interpreters and compilers are discussed
in the answer to questions [4-0] and [4-2] and in the Scheme FAQ. See
the entry on Macintosh Common Lisp in question [4-1] for information
on the CD-ROM of Lisp code that Apple distributes with MCL 2.0.
