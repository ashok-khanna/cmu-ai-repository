   size is about 3mb. Cost is $2800 (workstations), $3500 (servers), $700
   (IBM PCs).  Supports CLOS and CLX ($200 extra).  Source code is

   question [1-2] on the wizards.doc file that comes with the release.

   [Note: Lucid encountered financial difficulties because of forays
    into C-related products; the Lisp end of the company remained strong.
    Harlequin announced on 23-NOV-94 that they have acquired the
    rights to the Lisp-related technology of Lucid, Inc., that they
    will market and support Lucid Common Lisp alongside their
    LispWorks products, and that they have hired several former Lucid
    employees for this purpose.]

Macintosh Common Lisp:

   Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) is an object-oriented dynamic language
   (OODL) from Digitool, Inc. MCL 4.0 will work on any Power Macintosh
   with at least 16 MB of RAM, 28 MB of disk storage, and Macintosh System
   Software 7.5 or later. MCL 3.1 will work on any 68K-based Macintosh
   with at least 8 MB of RAM, 15 MB of disk storage, and Macintosh System
   6.x or 7.x. Both versions are included on CD-ROM together with extensive
   documentation, runtime sources, development utilities, and sample code. 
   A CD-ROM drive is required for installation.
   
   MCL implements the industry standard Common Lisp programming language 
   and CLOS (as defined in Common Lisp: The Language, second edition), 
   and is fully integrated with the Macintosh family of personal computers.

   MCL is a completely integrated development environment, including a
   fast incremental compiler which produces efficient native PPC code or
   680x0 code, a window-based debugger, a source code stepper, a dynamic 
   object inspector, a stack backtrace inspector, a programmable 
   Macintosh-style emacs-like editor, online documentation, and an 
   interactive interface toolkit. MCL supports multiple processes and 
   provides both high-level object-oriented user interface class library 
   and complete low-level access to the Macintosh Toolbox.  

   Using MCL, you can create a standalone double-clickable Macintosh 
   application. A license is required to distribute an application
   created with MCL. Licenses are available to include the MCL compiler
   in a distributed application.

   MCL may be purchased individually or as a subscription; site licenses
   are also available. For more information, mailto:info@digitool.com; 
   for orders, mailto:orders@digitool.com, call (617) 441-5000 or fax 
   (617) 576-7680.  See <A NAME=id30 HREF="http://www.digitool.com/MCL-price-list.html">http://www.digitool.com/MCL-price-list.html</A> for 
   current pricing.
