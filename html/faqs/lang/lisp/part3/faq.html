<LI><A NAME=id0 HREF="faq-doc-0.html">Introduction</A>
<LI><A NAME=id1 HREF="faq-doc-1.html">[3-0] Why does (READ-FROM-STRING "foobar" :START 3) return FOOBAR instead of BAR?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id2 HREF="faq-doc-2.html">[3-1] Why can't it deduce from (READ-FROM-STRING "foobar" :START 3) </A>
<LI><A NAME=id3 HREF="faq-doc-3.html">[3-2] Why can't I apply #'AND and #'OR?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id4 HREF="faq-doc-4.html">[3-3] I used a destructive function (e.g. DELETE, SORT), but it didn't seem to work.  Why?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id5 HREF="faq-doc-5.html">[3-4] After I NREVERSE a list, it's only one element long.  After I SORT a list, it's missing things.  What happened?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id6 HREF="faq-doc-6.html">[3-5] Why does (READ-LINE) return "" immediately instead of waiting for me to type a line?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id7 HREF="faq-doc-7.html">[3-6] I typed a form to the read-eval-print loop, but nothing happened. Why?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id8 HREF="faq-doc-8.html">[3-7] DEFMACRO doesn't seem to work.  When I compile my file, LISP warns me that my macros are undefined functions, or complains  "Attempt to call <function> which is defined as a macro."</A>
<LI><A NAME=id9 HREF="faq-doc-9.html">[3-8] Name conflict errors are driving me crazy! (EXPORT, packages)</A>

<LI><A NAME=id12 HREF="faq-doc-12.html">[3-11] Miscellaneous things to consider when debugging code.</A>
<LI><A NAME=id13 HREF="faq-doc-13.html">[3-12] When is it right to use EVAL?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id14 HREF="faq-doc-14.html">[3-13] Why does my program's behavior change each time I use it?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id15 HREF="faq-doc-15.html">[3-14] When producing formatted output in Lisp, where should you  put the newlines (e.g., before or after the line, FRESH-LINE vs TERPRI, ~& vs ~% in FORMAT)?</A>
<LI><A NAME=id16 HREF="faq-doc-16.html">[3-15] I'm using DO to do some iteration, but it doesn't terminate. </A>
<LI><A NAME=id17 HREF="faq-doc-17.html">[3-16] My program works when interpreted but not when compiled!</A>
