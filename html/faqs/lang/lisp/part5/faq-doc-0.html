This post contains Part 5 of the Lisp FAQ. It is cross-posted to the
newsgroup comp.lang.clos because it contains material of interest to
people concerned with CLOS, PCL and object-oriented programming in
Lisp. The other parts of the Lisp FAQ are posted only to the
newsgroups comp.lang.lisp and news.answers.

If you think of questions that are appropriate for this FAQ, or would
like to improve an answer, please send email to us at ai+lisp-faq@cs.cmu.edu.

CLOS/PCL Questions (Part 5):

  [5-0]   What is CLOS (PCL) and where can I get it?
          How do you pronounce CLOS? What is the Meta-Object Protocol (MOP)?
  [5-1]   What documentation is available about object-oriented
          programming in Lisp?  
  [5-2]   How do I write a function that can access defstruct slots by
          name?  I would like to write something like 
          (STRUCTURE-SLOT &#60;object&#62; '&#60;slot-name&#62;).   
  [5-3]   How can I list all the CLOS instances in a class?
  [5-4]   How can I store data and CLOS instances (with possibly circular
          references) on disk so that they may be retrieved at some later
          time? (Persistent Object Storage)
  [5-5]   Given the name of a class, how can I get the names of its slots?
  [5-6]   Free CLOS software.
  [5-7]   Common CLOS Blunders

In general, questions about object oriented programming in Lisp,
especially questions about using CLOS or compiling PCL, should be
directed to the newsgroup comp.lang.clos.

The comp.lang.clos newsgroup is archived in
   <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.lang.clos/">ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/news/comp.lang.clos/</A>
on a weekly basis.
