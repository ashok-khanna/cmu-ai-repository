* Introduction or "What's this all about?"
------------------------------------------

This document is for new and experienced users of literate programming
tools.  The purpose is to explain the concept of literate programming and
to provide a resource for locating files of interest to literate
programmers and those interested in literate programming.

The Literate Programming (LitProg) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list
is maintained by Dave Thompson, who can be reached at:

    thompson@sun1.coe.ttu.edu     * Preferred mailing address for FAQ
                                    related comments/questions.
    wqdbt@ttacs1.ttu.edu          * Forwarded to my pc.

Comment and constructive criticism is welcome.  Direct flames to
/dev/null (or &#62; nul if you're a msdos user! ;-)  If you find an error,
please report it.  I'm particularly interested in establishing the
locations of generally available literate programming tools.  If you are
the author of such a tool and wish to have it included in this list,
please send email.

Please note this is a work-in-progress.  It is *not* complete, and
probably will not be complete for some months.  Nevertheless, the
information contained herein may be useful to some.  Use it as it is
intended.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Typography
------------

Major sections of the FAQ are divided by double lines (====).  Minor
sections and other divisions are separated by single lines (----).
Major topics use a "* " as a leader.  Minor topics use a "- " as a
leader.  This should simplify searching for topics.

* How do I get the FAQ?
-----------------------

- Literate Programming FAQ.
---------------------------

You have many ways to get a current copy of this FAQ.  One is to use
anonymous ftp (if you don't know how, see a later section in this FAQ)
to connect to one of the Comprehensive TeX Arvchive Network (CTAN) sites
or the Literate Programming Archive and retrieve a copy of the file.
(For more information on CTAN and the literate programming archive, see
the section below entitled "Internet Nodes of Interest to Literate
Programmers.")

An alternative is to use the fileserver at Sam Houston State University
(SHSU).  Send a message to FILESERV@SHSU.EDU (FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET) and
include in your message

    SENDME LITPROG.FAQ

The file server will forward a copy of the file to you via email.


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- FWEB FAQ
----------

Marcus Speh &#60;marcus@x4u.desy.de&#62; maintains the FWEB FAQ.  The current
version number is 1.29.  It can be retrieved in the same way as this
FAQ; either by anonymous ftp or through the SHSU file server.  On the
SHSU server, the file name is FAQ.FWEB.  Invoke your ftp software, open
a connection to NIORD.SHSU.EDU [192.92.115.8], attach to the directory
FAQ, and transfer the file FAQ.FWEB.

Alternatively, send a message to the file server, FILESERV@SHSU.EDU
(FILESERV@SHSU.BITNET), and include the following text in a one line
message:

    SENDME FAQ.FWEB

The file server will send the current version of the file via email.

The FWEB FAQ exists in various formats, including HyperText (see other
resources below). In Europe, the complete distribution can also be
obtained from ftp.desy.de [131.169.10.115] in directory
/pub/faq/web/fweb/.  It is also available from the literate programming
archive (LPA) in the directory LPA/Documentation/faq/fweb (see the
references to LPA below for more information).


= ======================================================================

* Is there a newsgroup?
-----------------------

One of the most important resources is the literate programming
newsgroup, comp.programming.literate.  You can read this newsgroup using
your standard reader.  Altenatively, the newsgroup is gated to a mailing
list hosted by George Greenwade and Sam Houston State University.  You
can subscribe by sending mail to the list-server, LISTSERV@SHSU.EDU (or
LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET), and include in the message one line of text:

    SUBSCRIBE LITPROG  "your name in quotes"

The list is unmoderated; messages sent to litprog@shsu.edu are
automatically distributed to all subscribers and cross-posted to
comp.programming.literate.

Archives of the mailing list and newsgroup are maintained on
niord.shsu.edu [192.92.115.8] in the directory litprog.


= ======================================================================

* What internet nodes are of interest to literate programmers?

* What is Literate Programming?
-------------------------------

Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source
together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.  In fact,
literate programs should be enjoyable reading, even inviting!  (Sorry
Bob, I couldn't resist!)  In general, literate programs combine source
and documentation in a single file.  Literate programming tools then
parse the file to produce either readable documentation or compilable
source.  The WEB style of literate programming was created by D.E. Knuth
during the development of his TeX typsetting software.

All the original work revolves around a particular literate programming
tool called WEB.  Knuth says:

     The philosophy behind WEB is that an experienced system
     programmer, who wants to provide the best possible
     documentation of his or her software products, needs two
     things simultaneously: a language like TeX for formatting,
     and a language like C for programming.  Neither type of
     language can provide the best documentation by itself; but
     when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system
     that is much more useful than either language separately.

     The structure of a software program may be thought of as a
     web that is made up of many interconnected pieces.  To
     document such a program we want to explain each individual
     part of the web and how it relates to its neighbours. The
     typographic tools provided by TeX give us an opportunity to
     explain the local structure of each part by making that
     structure visible, and the programming tools provided by
     languages such as C or Fortran make it possible for us to
     specify the algorithms formally and unambigously. By
     combining the two, we can develop a style of programming
     that maximizes our ability to perceive the structure of a
     complex piece of software, and at the same time the
     documented programs can be mechanically translated into a
     working software system that matches the documentation.


= ======================================================================

* How do I begin literate programming?
--------------------------------------

A recommended book is D.E. Knuth's collection of articles (1992)
"Literate Programming," Center for the Study of Language and
Information, Stanford University, ISBN 0-937073-80-6 (pbk).  This book
gives insight into Knuth's thoughts as he developed the web system of
literate programming (and TeX for typesetting).  It does not document
methods for literate programming.

A recommended book is Wayne Sewell's (1989) "Weaving a Program: Literate
Programming in WEB," Van Nostrand Reinhold, ISBN 0-442-31946-0 (pbk).
This book focuses on using Knuth's web system.

Some talk exists in the newsgroup/mailing list for a Usenet University
course in literate programming.  I'm sure discussion of this topic will
be welcomed.  If you are interested, please participate.


= ======================================================================

* What literate programming tools are available and where are they?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A significant number of tools for literate programming are available.
Most have been ported from their original systems, so support multiple
computer platforms.  If you are the developer of such a tool, and would
like to make the software freely available, please send me email and
I'll reply with a form (like those below) for you to fill in.  (Or
short-circuit the process and kludge a form from below. :-)

Readme:         With bundle above

Description:

  CLiP does not use explicite commands to perform the extraction
  process. Rather it recognizes pseudostatemens written as comments in
  the programming language in question. CLiP distinguishes
  pseudostatments from ordinary comments because the former comply with
  a a particular style. This style can be adjusted to suit virtually any
  programming language. The CLiP approach to LP makes the system
  extremely versatile. It is independent of programming language and
  text processing environment. We designed CLiP to be compatible with
  hypertext systems as well but we have not yet experimented with this
  form of documentation.

  Features:
  + CLiP imposes virtually no limitations on the text-processing system
    used to produce the documentation. If the text-processor supports
    these items you can
    + structure the documentation according to your own taste.
    + include drawings, pictures, tables etc.
    + disclose your documentatio my means of X-ref tables, Indexes,
      Table of contents, Table of tables, Table of figures, etc.
    + typeset the documented code.
  + Extracts any number of modules from a maximum of 64 source files.
  + No pretty-printing. Code from the source files is copied "as is" to
    the module.
  + Appearance of code segments in the documentation matches those of
    the modules to ease the identification of code segements.
  + Supports partially specified data types.
  + Comprehensive user manual (preliminary version) and technical
    description.
  - No automatic generation of a X-ref table for program identifiers.

Readme:         Unknown

Description:

The Literate Programming Workshop is an environment for the integrated
development of program source text and documentation in combined
documents. It consists of a WYSIWYG word processor based on a style
sheet approach, a mechanism to extract parts of the text in a document,
and a project management system that handles multi-document projects.
The system is designed to be used in conjunction with MPW: it prepares
raw source text for the MPW compilers, accepts MPW error messages, and
shows them in the context of the original documents. Automatic indexing
and hypertext features allow for easy access to both source text and
documentation.

Support:        Shareware, so I assume that the authors will support
                  their product.

Readme:         With bundle above.

Description:

  noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while
  remaining as simple as possible.  Its primary advantages are
  simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence.  noweb uses 5
  control sequences to WEB's 27.  noweb now supports indexing and
  identifier cross-reference.  The simple noweb manual is only 2 pages;
  documenting the full power of noweave and notangle requires another 3
  pages.  noweb works ``out of the box'' with any programming language,
  and its formatter-dependent part is a 60-line nawk program. The
  primary sacrifice relative to WEB is the loss of prettyprinting.

  can be pretty printed and a set of files containing code for
  compilation/interpretation by the appropriate language processors.

  Strengths include speed, simplicity, multiple languages, nice indices
  and cross-references, latex.  Doesn't require any special macros or
  macro files.

  Drawbacks: latex-dependent, no code pretty printing, harder to make
  indices than cweb.

  More good stuff: nice support for make, doesn't reformat source files,
  so they're easy to debug.  Lots of control without too much effort.
  That is, it doesn't do too much!

  Future directions... Very little change planned, except perhaps
  refinements in the indexing software.

Support:        Hack it yourself or send e-mail to preston@cs.rice.edu

Description:

  WinWordWEB is a set of a Word for Windows macros (plus a paragraph
  style) that provide a crude literate programming environment.  The
  ``look and feel'' of the system is based on Norman Ramsey's noweb, but
  can easily be modified to suit individual tastes.

Support:

  None.  WinWordWEB was written as a prototype to see if a WYSIWYG
  literate programming system was possible.  It is intended as a jumping
  off point for future work by others. However, the system is
  surprisingly usable as it stands, and the author is interested in
  hearing from users (satisfied and dissatisfied).

  Anyone interested in actively supporting (and improving) the product
  should contact the author via email.

* Are there other tools I should know about?
--------------------------------------------

First of all, I'll list some not-quite-literate-programming tools.
Some may consider these to be pretty-printers.  Others may call them
literate programming tools.  In any event, they don't seem to be quite
in the same category as the tools listed above, so I'll include them
here.

- C2LaTeX
---------

Developer:      John D. Ramsdell
Version:        Unknown
Hardware:       Unix
Languages:      C
Formatter:      LaTeX but it's easy to change the formatter.
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from
                  <A NAME=id9 HREF="ftp://omnigate.clarkson.edu/pub/tex/tex-programs/c2latex">omnigate.clarkson.edu:/pub/tex/tex-programs/c2latex</A>.
Readme:         Absent.  Documentation is in the C source for c2latex.

Description:

  C2latex provides simple support for literate programming in C.  Given
  a C source file in which the comments have been written in LaTeX,
  c2latex converts the C source file into a LaTeX source file.  It can
  be used to produce typeset listings of C programs and/or documentation
  associated with the program.

  C2latex produces LaTeX source by implementing a small number of rules.
  A C comment that starts at the beginning of a line is copied
  unmodified into the LaTeX source file.  Otherwise, non-blank lines are
  surrounded by a pair of formatting commands (\begin{flushleft} and
  \end{flushleft}), and the lines are separated by \\*. Each non-blank
  line is formatted using LaTeX's \verb command, except comments within
  the line are formatted in an \mbox.

Support:        Send bug reports to ramsdell@mitre.org.


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- c2man
-------

Developer:      Graham Stoney
Version:        Unknown
Hardware:       Presumably anything with a C compiler.
Languages:      C
Formatter:      nroff -man, texinfo
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from
                  ftp.wustl.edu:
                    /usenet/comp.sources.reviewed/volume03/c2man*
                  ftp.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de:
                    /pub/archive/comp.sources/reviewed/c2man*
Readme:         Unknown

Description:

  The primary philosophy here is to use the programming language as far
  as possible to express the programmer's intentions, and to use
  comments only when the programming language is not sufficiently
  expressive. A comment can then become part of the language grammar
  which is recognised by a "documentation compiler". This tool parses a
  superset of the programming language and can automatically generate
  documentation in human-readable form by associating the programmer's
  comments with the objects in the code by their context.

Support:        Unknown.


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- cnoweb
--------

Developer:      Jim Fox
Version:        1.4 (January 4, 1991)
Hardware:       Anything with C and TeX.
Languages:      C
Formatter:      Plain TeX.
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from:
                  CTAN
                  LPA:/c.c++
Readme:         Unknown, cnoweb.tex contains documentation.

Description:

  cnoweb is as it's name describes: write C, not web.  No tangling or
  weaving is implemented.  Documentation (between standard /* */
  delimiteres) is written in TeX.  cnoweb provides typesetting of
  documentation, an table of contents of routines, and pretty-printing
  of C source.

= ======================================================================

* What other resources are available?
-------------------------------------

- World Wide Web
----------------

An untapped resource (by me anyway ;-) is the World Wide Web.  Marcus
Speh has expended considerable effort in this regard.  If you're
connected to WWW, then access:

  <A NAME=id10 HREF="http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg.html">http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg.html</A>

If you aren't connected to WWW, telnet to info.cern.ch and explore.
You can reach Marcus' literate programming pages by typing:

  go <A NAME=id11 HREF="http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg.html">http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg.html</A>

Help for people who have only Email and neither WWW nor telnet, can be
obtained by Email from LISTSERV@INFO.CERN.CH by sending a message
containing the command HELP.  Instructions will be returned by email.
For literate programming documents, you can try anonymous ftp to
ftp.desy.de [131.169.10.115] and attach to directory:

  /pub/userWWW/projects/Announce


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- TeX Resources
---------------

Another resource of interest to literate programmers is the info-tex
mailing list.  If you're using (La)TeX as your typsetting system and
have access to internet, then you should investigate this mailing list.
Mail list service is available through the SHSU list-server.  To
subscribe, send a message to LISTSERV@SHSU.EDU (LISTSERV@SHSU.BITNET),
and include in the message one line of text:

    SUBSCRIBE INFO-TEX "your name in quotes"

The list is unmoderated; messages sent to info-tex@shsu.edu are
automatically distributed to all subscribers and cross-posted to
comp.text.tex.

Archives of the mailing list and newsgroup are maintained on
niord.shsu.edu [192.92.115.8] in the directory info-tex.

Another reason the TeX resources should be important is that so many of
the literate programming tools rely on either plain TeX or LaTeX as
their text formatter.  (La)TeX software systems exist for most computing
platforms.  These systems can be found on CTAN and other major archive
sites.  Use archie to find them or simply ftp to one of the CTAN
sites and browse.


- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Virtual Coursework
--------------------

Marcus Speh plans an introductory course on Literate Programming on the
Internet, part of the first semester of "Global Network Academy" [GNA],
a non-profit corporation incorporated in the state of Texas, affilated
with the Usenet University project. The texts/sample programs for this
class will be made available via anonymous FTP. A special room on GNA
Virtual Campus will be staffed by a consultant in one to two hour
shifts.  Students with questions can telnet to the virtual campus and
ask questions of the staff there. Tuition: Students should agree to work
for Global Network Academy in some capacity. This may include agreeing
to serve as a consultant next term, donating computing resources which
belong to them, helping with programming, etc. If you are interested in
registering for the course either as a student or as a consultant,
please contact marcus@x4u.desy.de. You will receive a standard reply
message; no further action will be taken until January 94.

[Editor's note: Because of workload, Marcus requests that email
inquiries be limited to a statement of interest for either a student or
consultant position until January 1994.]


= ======================================================================

* Are there any code examples?
------------------------------

Examples of web programs are included with the FWEB, CWEB, and noweb
distributions.  nuweb is written in itself.

Cameron Smith converted the K&#38;R calculator program into a literate
program.   It can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from:
  niord.shsu.edu [192.92.115.8] directory kr-cweb-sample as
    krcwsamp.zip
  or from
    LPA/Documentation

Ross Williams has released a funnelweb example.  You can retrieve this
file from node ftp.adelaide.edu.au [129.127.40.3] as
  /pub/funnelweb/examples/except.*
This file should be on CTAN as well.

Lee Wittenberg has posted two examples written in CWEB.  They are
available via anonymous ftp from:
  bart.kean.edu:~/pub/leew/samples.LP


= ======================================================================

* Bibliographies
----------------

Nelson Beebe has collected an extensive bibliography treating literate
programming.  His work is available for anonymous ftp from
ftp.math.utah.edu [128.110.198.2] in directory /pub/tex/bib as files:
    litprog.bib
    litprog.ltx.
Although I have not verified this, LPA is an alternate source for these
files.  Note that they are updated frequently (Nelson says several times
each week), so be sure to get a fresh copy before extensive use.
Joachim Schrod indicates that these files may be updated daily and can
be retrieved via anonymous ftp at LPA/documentation.


= ======================================================================

* How to anonymously ftp
------------------------

Pretty much everything mentioned here is available by anonymous FTP.
FAQ lists cross-posted to news.answers and rec.answers can be gotten
from rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.209], under /pub/usenet/news.answers or under
/pub/usenet/more.specific.group.name

"anonymous FTP" is just a way for files to be stored where anyone
can retrieve them over the Net.    For example, to retrieve the
latest version of the literate programming FAQ, do the following:

&#62; ftp rtfm.mit.edu              /* connect to the site; message follows */
&#62; anonymous                     /* type this when it asks for your name */
&#62; &#60;your email address&#62;          /* type your address as the password    */
&#62; cd /pub/usenet                /* go to the directory you want to be   */
&#62; cd comp.programming.literate  /* one level down (no slash).           */
&#62; dir                           /* look at what's there                 */
&#62; get literate-progamming-faq   /* get the file; case-sensitive         */
&#62; quit                          /* stop this mysterious thing           */

If your FTP program complains that it doesn't know where the site you
want to use is, type the numerical address instead of the sitename:

&#62; ftp 18.70.0.209               /* connect with numerical address */

If you don't have ftp access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with the single word "help" in the body of the message.

Getting binary files (executables, or any compressed files) is only
slightly more difficult.   You need to set binary mode inside FTP before
you transfer the file.

&#62; binary            /* set binary transfer mode  */
&#62; ascii             /* set back to text transfer mode */

FAQs and spoiler lists are generally ascii files; everything else is
generally binary files.

Some common extensions on binary files in archive sites are:

  .Z           Compressed; extract with uncompress
  .tar.Z       Compressed 'tape archive'; uncompress then untar or tar -xvf
  .gz or .z    Gnu gzip; use gunzip (available from prep.gnu.ai.mit.edu)
  .sit         (Mac) StufIt archive
  .zip         Extract with Zip or Unzip
  .zoo         Yet another archive/compress program
  .lhe         (Amiga) ?
  .lzh         Lha archive program.
  .arj         (PC) Arj archive program.
  .exe         (PC) Sometimes self-extracting archives-just execute them.
  .uue or .UUE Transfer as text file; use uudecode to convert to binary
  .hqx         (Mac) BinHex format; transfer in text mode

Generic help can be found in the FAQs of comp.binaries.&#60;your_system_type&#62;
for how to transfer, extract, and virus-check binary files.  (At
rtfm.mit.edu)

If you can't FTP from your site, use one of the following ftp-by-mail
servers:

  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
  ftpmail@src.doc.ic.ac.uk
  ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
  ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr

For complete instructions, send a message reading "help" to the server.

If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, or exactly where it
is, there are programs and servers that can help you.  For more info,
send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.with with the body of the
message reading send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources


Thanks to Aliza R. Panitz (the "buglady") for this text.  I copied it
verbatim from her post on faq-maintainers with only minor modifications.

* Acknowledgements
------------------

This document would not have happened without the help of many people.
Among them are Marcus Speh, George Greenwade, Rob Beezer, Joachim
Schrod, Piet van Oostrum, and Ross N. Williams.  A special thanks to
Aliza R. Panitz for the text describing how to execute an anonymous ftp
for files of interest.

Any omissions from these acknowledgements should be considered an act of
stupidity on my part.  Of course, the authors of literate programming
tools mentioned above all play a vital role in the vitality of literate
programming. Furthermore, participants in the comp.programming.literate
newsgroup (and associated mailing list) all contributed in various
fashions. Thank all of you.


= ======================================================================

* End notes
-----------

This document will be evolving over the next few months.  I'm planning
on adding entries for additional literate programming tools and will
expand the sections on examples as more examples become available. Tools
I will include are WEB (the original pascal version) for starters.
Others will be added as I find and document them.  Omission of a
particular tool should not be considered a snub in any sense--simply an
error or oversight on my part.

History:

  First release: Fri 10/15/1993 -- Yep, I finally did it!
  Thu 10/21/93 -- Minor change to ftp instructions.
  Fri 10/22/93 -- Minor change to stuttgart ip and fweb.faq version.
                  Made reader-recommended changes, lots of re-
                  organization, and added a few tools.
  Mon 11/01/93 -- Corrected typo in address.
  Thu 11/11/93 -- Minor change to www.
  Fri 11/12/93 -- Fixed CLiP entry, spiderweb entry.
  Wed 01/05/94 -- Lots of minor updates.  Reformatting of tool entries
                  deserves a minor revision update.
  Thu 01/06/94 -- Added Schrod's pointers for noweb, spideryweb, 
                  WinWordWeb.
