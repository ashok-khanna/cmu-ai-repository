<H1>[2-3] What Scheme-related discussion groups and mailing lists exist?</H1>
<PRE>
     
Before posting to any discussion group, please read the rest
of this FAQ, to make sure your question isn't already answered.

See the Lisp FAQ for a list of Lisp-related discussion groups and
mailing lists. We list here only those newsgroups and mailing lists
directly associated with Scheme.

Newsgroups:

   comp.lang.scheme        General Scheme-related discussion.
                           This newsgroup is available in digest
                           fromat as part of the Scheme Digest
                           scheme@mc.lcs.mit.edu.
   comp.lang.scheme.c      Discussion of C-Scheme, a scheme dialect
                           more commonly known as "MIT Scheme".
                           This newsgroup is gatewayed to the
                           info-cscheme@zurich.ai.mit.edu mailing list.
   comp.lang.scheme.scsh   Discussion of Scsh, the ``Scheme Shell'', a UNIX
			   shell/systems programming environment implemented
			   on top of Scheme 48 (a portable, byte-code
			   compiled R4RS Scheme implementation).
			   This newsgroup is gatewayed to the
			   scsh@zurich.ai.mit.edu mailing list.
   comp.lang.lisp.x        Discussion of XLISP, a dialect of Lisp, and XScheme.
   comp.lang.dylan         Discussion of Dylan (see [4-6]), Apple's
                           new Scheme-like programming language. Gatewayed to
                           info-dylan@cambridge.apple.com. 

We list several mailing lists below. In general, to be added to
a mailing list, send mail to the "-request" version of the address.
This avoids flooding the mailing list with annoying and trivial
administrative requests. [To subscribe to info-mcl, info-dylan, or
other mailing lists based at cambridge.apple.com, send a message to
majordomo@cambridge.apple.com with "subscribe &#60;list_name&#62;" in the
message body. Likewise use "unsubscribe &#60;list_name&#62;" to cancel your
subscription and "help" to get help.]


General Scheme Mailing Lists:

   scheme@mc.lcs.mit.edu           Discussion of Scheme. Gatewayed to
                                   the comp.lang.scheme newsgroup.
   scheme@ai.mit.edu               General discussion about Scheme.


Particular Flavors of Scheme:

   info-cscheme@altdorf.ai.mit.edu,
   info-cscheme@zurich.ai.mit.edu  C-Scheme. Gatewayed to the
                                   comp.lang.scheme.c newsgroup.
