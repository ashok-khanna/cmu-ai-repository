<H1>[2-1] Free Scheme implementations.</H1>
<PRE>
Repositories of Scheme source code are described in the answer to
question [1-9].

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .z, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files. 

Files that end with a .z suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from:
   <A NAME=id1 HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/</A>
as the files gzip-1.2.4.shar, gzip-1.2.4.tar,or gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe.

Repositories of Scheme implementations:

   Many free Scheme implementations are available from swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu
   [18.43.0.246]. See also the Scheme Repository described below.

   The Scheme Repository contains a Scheme bibliography, copies of the
   R4RS report, sample Scheme code for a variety of purposes, several
   utilities, and most free implementations.  (Implementations of Scheme
   available from the repository include elk, gambit, scm, fools, rabbit,
   s48, scheme84, scheme88, pseudo, xscheme, umb-scheme, siod, vscm, and
   pixiescheme.) The repository was established by Ozan S. Yigit and
   is currently maintained by David Eby and John Zuckerman
   &#60;scheme-repository-request@cs.indiana.edu&#62;. The repository is
   accessible by anonymous ftp at 
      <A NAME=id2 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/">ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/</A>   [129.79.254.191]
   The repository is mirrored in INRIA, courtesy of Christian Queinnec

Scheme implementations:

   BIGLOO is a Scheme interpreter and compiler. It conforms to the
   IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE P1178) with some extensions, such as
   regular expression parsing (RGC), a lexical analyzer generator, a full
   foreign function interface, and a pattern matching compiler.  Bigloo
   can also compile modules written in Caml (an ML dialect), letting you
   mix Scheme, ML, and C.  Object-oriented programming is provided by
   Meroon v3. The main goal of Bigloo is to deliver small and fast stand
   alone applications.  Bigloo produces ANSI C and hence should be easy
   to port. It runs on Sparc (1, 2, 10), SONY-NEWS (MIPS R3000), IRIS
   Indigo (MIPS R3000), Sun 3/60, DecStation 3100, PC-486 (linux), and
   HP-PA (730).  It is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id4 HREF="ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/icsla/Implementations/">ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/icsla/Implementations/</A> [192.93.2.54]
   as the files bigloo1.7.tar.gz and camloo0.2.tar.gz.

   Elk (Extension Language Kit) has been designed specifically as an
   embeddable, reusable extension language subsystem for applications written
   in C or C++.  Elk is also useful as a stand-alone Scheme implementation,
   in particular as a platform for rapid prototyping of X11-based Scheme
   programs.  Elk was first published in 1989; the current version is Elk 3.0.
      The Elk distribution includes a Scheme interpreter (embeddable and
   stand-alone versions), several dynamically loadable extensions, run-time
   support (including a top-level implemented in Scheme and a debugger),
   and 230+ pages of documentation (troff and PostScript format).
      Major features of Elk are incremental, dynamic loading of compiled
   extensions (supported on many platforms); freezing of the interpreter or
   application into a new executable file; a C/C++ programmer's interface
   for language interoperability; Scheme bindings for X11 Xlib, Xt, Athena
   and Motif Widgets; a UNIX interface (not restricted to POSIX); bitstrings,
   records, and regular expressions; a stop-and-copy and an incremental,
   generational garbage collector.
      The Elk 3.0 distribution and more information about Elk are available
   in the World Wide Web at
      <A NAME=id5 HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~net/elk">http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~net/elk</A>
   The distribution is also available on a number of FTP sites including
    <A NAME=id6 HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/devel_tools/elk-3.0.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/devel_tools/elk-3.0.tar.gz</A>

   For more information contact Oliver Laumann &#60;net@cs.tu-berlin.de&#62;.

   FDU Scheme is a R3RS implementation of Scheme for the Prime
   50-series under Primos. It is available by anonymous ftp from
   fdumad.fdu.edu [132.238.1.1] (username "anonymous", password
   &#60;RETURN&#62;). Attach to the Scheme subdirectory (cd '*&#62;scheme') and
   transfer all files in it and its subdirectories using file type
   binary.  For more information, contact Peter Falley,
   &#60;falley@fdumad.fdu.edu&#62;.

   Fools' Lisp is a small Scheme interpreter that is R4RS conformant, and
   is available by anonymous ftp from
      scam.berkeley.edu:/pub/src/local/fools.1.3.2.tar.Z [128.32.138.1] 
   Fools' Lisp runs on Sun3 and Sun4 (SunOs), DecStation 3100s, Vax
   (Ultrix), Sequent, and Apollo. Implemented by Jonathan Lee
   &#60;jonathan@scam.berkeley.edu&#62;. 

   Gambit is a high-performance implementation of Scheme based on an
   optimizing compiler.  It conforms to the IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE
   P1178) and the Revised^4 Report on Scheme (R4RS) and supports the
   whole numeric tower (i.e. integer, rational, real and complex numbers).
   Gambit extends the standards by providing: weak pairs, wills, string
   ports, records, property lists, namespaces, futures, pretty printer,
   debugger, multitasking, and compiler declarations.  To make it portable
   and simplify bootstrapping, the compiler is written in IEEE-Scheme and
   makes use of a high-level abstract-machine (called GVM) for the
   intermediate representation.  A "Scheme-in-Scheme" approach was adopted
   to minimize the amount of non-portable code in the system (nearly all of
   the runtime library is written in Scheme including the interpreter and
   debugger).  Three different variants of Gambit were produced:

   Gambit-68K (first public release in 1990; last version: 2.0, june 1993):
     This is the original Gambit system with a native code back-end
     for Motorola 680x0.  It works on most 68K based Unix workstations
     and on the BBN GP1000 shared-memory multiprocessor.  The back-end
     for the GP1000 implements Multilisp's "future" parallel construct
     using lazy-task-creation (a very low overhead task spawning
     mechanism).
     <A NAME=id8 HREF="ftp://ftp.iro.umontreal.ca/pub/parallele/gambit/gamb68k.tar.Z">ftp.iro.umontreal.ca:/pub/parallele/gambit/gamb68k.tar.Z</A>

   MacGambit (first public release in 1991; last version: 2.2.2, oct 1995):
     This is a port of Gambit-68K for the Macintosh.  It is a complete
     development environment, including a Scheme-aware editor, an online
     help system, and a linker to build standalone applications.  A
     drawing window for simple graphics and an interface to many of the
     Macintosh's "Toolbox" routines are available.  An executable
     MacGambit application is supplied with the distribution as well as
     all the sources (ThinkC 4.0 or CodeWarrior 6 or higher are needed to
     recompile the sources).
     <A NAME=id9 HREF="ftp://ftp.iro.umontreal.ca/pub/parallele/gambit/MacGambit.sea.hqx">ftp.iro.umontreal.ca:/pub/parallele/gambit/MacGambit.sea.hqx</A>

   Gambit-C (first public release in 1994; last version: 2.3.1, april 1996):
     In this variant of Gambit, the compiler generates highly portable
     C code that is reasonably efficient.  The primary goals of Gambit-C
     are portability and correctness (in particular it correctly implements
     tail-recursion across modules and uses a precise garbage-collector).
     Gambit-C runs on a wide range of Unix workstations, on Macintosh, and
     DOS/Windows.  It also supports these features: dynamic-loading
     of compiled files, C-interface (FFI), and a memory management system
     that expands and contracts the heap based on the program's needs.
     Standalone executables can be created with Gambit-C (a minimal
     application is about 700 Kbytes when statically linked and 5 Kbytes
     when the runtime system is compiled as a shared-library).

   Gambit can be used freely for non-commercial uses (including academic
   research and education).  A license is required to use Gambit
   commercially (contact gambit@iro.umontreal.ca).

   HELP (a lazy Scheme) is available by anonymous ftp from
   sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/lang/lazy-scheme.hqx.  Written by
   Thomas Schiex (schiex@cert.fr, schiex@irit.fr). Help is a complete and
   efficient Scheme-like functional lazy Lisp interpreter.  It works only
   on 68020 (or more) based Macintoshes. It has a 'friendly' interface
   (parenthesis matcher, auto-indent), uses a full call-by-need semantics
   and includes many examples, including a symbolic compiler for the
   680x0. Efficiency is good and lazyness is fully parametrizable (you
   may turn Help into a strict Scheme-like language if you like). French
   AND English updated docs are included in Word4 and plain text formats.

   LIBSCHEME is a C library implementing Scheme as described in R4RS.  It
   is easily integrated into a C program as a command interpreter or
   extension language, and is easily extended in C with new primitive
   types, primitve functions and syntax.  It should be portable to most
   machines with an ANSI C compiler. It is available by anonymous ftp
   from 
      <A NAME=id13 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/imp/">ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/imp/</A>

   reported to bug-cscheme@martigny.ai.mit.edu (for the DOS version, send
   bug reports to bug-cscheme-dos@martigny.ai.mit.edu).  MIT Scheme
   includes Edwin (Scheme's Emacs-like editor) and Liar (the Scheme
   compiler). Does not have a convenient foreign function interface yet.
   FTP distribution includes MIT C-Scheme Reference and User manuals, as
   well as the Revised^4 Report on Scheme. Discussion occurs on the
   newsgroup comp.lang.scheme.c (gatewayed to the mailing list
   info-cscheme@zurich.ai.mit.edu). For DOS floppy distribution requests
   (includes printed copies of manuals), send $95.00 (payable in U.S.
   funds to "Scheme Distribution") to cover costs of distribution to
   Scheme Distribution, c/o Prof. Hal Abelson, 545 Technology Sq. rm 410,

   MzScheme is a Scheme implementation for Unix, Windows (Win32), and
   MacOS. In addition to supporting standard R4RS Scheme (including the
   full numerical tower), MzScheme provides pre-emptive threads,
   generative record datatypes, an exception system (integrated with all
   primitive errors), classes and objects, first-class compilation units,
   regular expression parsing, and simple TCP support on all platforms.
     MzScheme can dynamically load extensions implemented in C, and it
   can be embedded into any C/C++ application. Interoperability with C is
   facilitated by the use of a conservative garbage collector.
     MzScheme is the core interpreter for MrEd, an engine for developing
   portable GUI applications for X Windows, Windows, and MacOS. DrScheme
   (currently under development, using MzScheme/MrEd) will incorporate
   project management, debugging, and modular analysis to provide a
   complete Scheme development environment for pedagogical and
   professional use.
     For information and online documentation for MzScheme, MrEd, and 
   DrScheme, see

   Oaklisp is an seamless integration of Scheme with an object-oriented
   substrate. Available by anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id20 HREF="ftp://f.gp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/bap/oak/ftpable/">f.gp.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/bap/oak/ftpable/</A> [128.2.250.164]

   and includes reference and implementation manuals. Written by Barak
   Pearlmutter &#60;bap@cse.ogi.edu&#62; and Kevin Lang &#60;kevin@research.nj.nec.com&#62;.

   PC-Scheme (aka PCScheme, PC Scheme) is an implementation of Scheme
   originally written by Texas Instruments. TI made a version of the
   source code freely distributable in 1987. TI stopped supporting
   the code, and some researchers at the University of Geneva produced
   a cleaned-up version (see PCS/Geneva below). On July 13, 1992, Ibuki
   announced that it had purchased the rights to PC Scheme from TI.
   Please see the Ibuki PC Scheme entry in [2-2]. If you want a
   high-quality and supported implementation of PC Scheme, buy the
   Ibuki implementation. It is certainly inexpensive enough. Now TI
   PC-Scheme is available by anonymous ftp from 
      <A NAME=id22 HREF="ftp://swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu/archive/pc-scheme/">swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu:/archive/pc-scheme/</A>
   and runs on MS-DOS 286/386 IBM PCs and compatibles. Version 3.3 
   should run on the 486, but no guarantees. Version 3.3 is the last
   free version. TI PC-Scheme conforms to the Revised^3 Report on Scheme.
   It includes an optimizing compiler, an emacs-like editor, inspector,
   debugger, performance testing, foreign function interface, window
   system and an object-oriented subsystem. It also supports the dialect
   used in Abelson and Sussman's SICP.

   PCS/Geneva is a cleaned-up version of Texas Instrument's PC Scheme
   developed at the University of Geneva. The main extensions to PC
   Scheme are 486 support, BGI graphics, LIM-EMS pagination support, line
   editing, mouse support, assembly-level interfacing, and several
   powerful Scheme-oriented editors. (TI's PC Scheme gives users full
   Revised^3 support along with many primitives for DOS, Graphics and
   Text Windows. A powerful built-in optimizing compiler produces fast
   code.) PCS/Geneva 4.02PL1 has been tested on XTs, ATs, AT386s and
   AT486s under various DOS and OS/2 versions. It even runs on
   Hewlett-Packard's HP95LX. It also runs on Suns with a DOS emulator.
   PCS/Geneva is available free by anonymous ftp from
      cui.unige.ch:/PUBLIC/pcs/ [129.194.70.1]
   as the files pcscheme.doc, pcscheme.exe, pcscheme.fil and pcscheme.taz
   or by email (uuencoded) from schemege@cui.unige.ch. If you ftp
   PCS/Geneva, please send mail to schemege@cui.unige.ch; the authors
   like to know their public and will inform you when a new release is
   available. This is also the email address for bug reports or if you
   need any kind of help. This product may be distributed freely and
   used without restrictions except for military purposes.
   (PCS/Geneva was developed by Larry Bartholdi &#60;lbartho@cui.unige.ch&#62;
   and Marc Vuilleumier &#60;mvuilleu@cui.unige.ch&#62;.)

   Scheme-&#62;C is an R4RS compliant Scheme system that is centered around
   a compiler that compiles Scheme to C.  Besides the base language,
   the system includes "expansion passing style" macros, a foreign function
   call capability, records, weak pointers, 3 X11 interfaces, call/cc, and a
   generational, conservative, copying garbage collector. The result is a
   system that is portable, efficient, and able to build applications that
   contain a mix of compiled and interpreted Scheme, and compiled code
   from C, C++ and other languages.  The current release of Scheme-&#62;C runs
   on the following systems: Digital Alpha AXP systems with OSF/1, MIPS
   based DECstations, VAXen with ULTRIX, MIPS based SGI systems, PC's 
   running Microsoft Windows 3.1, Apple Macintosh's running system 7.1,
   HP 9000/300, HP 9000/700, Sony News, Harris Nighthawk and other m88k
   systems, linux, Sun SPARC, and NT (Visual C++ compiler).  Earlier 
   releases also run on Sun3, DNx500, DN1000, 386's running Unix,
   DNx500, and DN1000 systems.  The software is available for
   anonymous ftp from  
      <A NAME=id24 HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Scheme-to-C/">gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/DEC/Scheme-to-C/</A> [16.1.0.2]
   There are three interfaces to X11, all written in Scheme, available
   from gatekeeper. The first is a complete set of stubs to Xlib included
   in the base system.  The second is an alternative to Xlib called SCIX,
   found in 
      <A NAME=id25 HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/X11/contrib/">gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/</A>
   The third, ezd, allows programs to easily
   produce interactive, structured graphics and is found in 
      <A NAME=id26 HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/ezd/">gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/DEC/ezd/</A>
   Those without ftp access can also obtain Scheme-&#62;C and ezd from the
   Prime Time Freeware CD, Vol. 1, No. 2.  Additional information is

   Scheme 48 is a Scheme implementation based on a virtual machine
   architecture. Scheme 48 is designed to be straightforward, flexible,
   reliable, and fast. It should be easily portable to 32-bit
   byte-addressed machines that have POSIX and ANSI C support.
   In addition to the usual Scheme built-in procedures and a development
   environment, library software includes support for hygienic macros (as
   described in the Revised^4 Scheme report), multitasking, records,
   exception handling, hash tables, arrays, weak pointers, and FORMAT.
   Scheme 48 implements and exploits an experimental module system
   loosely derived from Standard ML and Scheme Xerox.  The development
   environment supports interactive changes to modules and interfaces.
   A beta release of Scheme 48 is available by anonymous ftp from
      <A NAME=id27 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/imp/scheme48-0.36.tar.Z">ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/imp/scheme48-0.36.tar.Z</A>

   Scsh is a Unix shell/systems programming environment implemented on top of
   Scheme 48 (a portable, byte-code compiled R4RS Scheme implementation). Scsh
   provides

       - A high-level macro notation for writing typical shell-script 
	 computations: running programs, pipelines, I/O redirection, and so 
	 forth. For example, to decompress a file and mail it to someone, 
	 you might say
	   (run (| (gzcat home.html.gz) 
		   (mail -h "Here's my home page" shivers@lcs.mit.edu)))

	 To spell check your paper, printing out the results, you could say:
	   (run (| (delatex (&#60; paper.tex))
		   (spell)
		   (lpr -Ppulp)))

       - A complete system-call interface to Unix: fork, exec, I/O, file
	 system, time, env vars, and so forth. The I/O interface includes
	 a *complete* interface to BSD sockets, both Unix and TCP/IP domains.
	 I/O is completely integrated with Scheme ports. System calls return
	 useful values, not error codes; errors are reported by raising
	 exceptions which can be caught by handlers.

       - Other useful shell-programming utilities: filename globbing/pattern
	 matching, regexp matching, macros for writing AWK-like programs, field
	 and record parsers, and so forth.

       - The ability to write executable shell scripts using the Unix #!
	 interpreter feature, with access to command-line argv values.

   These features are completely integrated into Scheme 48's R4RS Scheme
   implementation; the programming language is Scheme. The scsh release
   is self-contained -- it comes with its own complete Scheme 48
   implementation. Scsh currently runs on the following platforms: DEC Ultrix,
   Harris NightHawk, HP-UX, IBM AIX, Linux, NetBSD/i386, NeXTSTEP/Intel,
   SGI IRIX, Solaris, and SunOS. It's not hard to port scsh to new systems.

      WB is a disk based, sorted associative array C library (database). These
   associative arrays consist of variable length (less that 256 bytes)
   keys and values.  WB comes with an interface to SCM. Basic
   operations are creation, destruction, opening and closing of 
   diskfiles and arrays, insertion, deletion, retrieval, successor, and
   predecessor (with respect to dictionary order of keys).  Functional
   application of find-next, deletion, and modification over a range of
   consecutive key values is supported. Multiple associative arrays
   can be stored in one disk file. Simultaneous access to multiple
   disk files is supported.  A structure checker, garbage collector
   are included.  A repair program and ram-disk type file (for
   temporary structures) are in developement. The current WB
   implementation has a file size limit of 2^32 * block size (default
   2048) = 2^43 bytes (8796 Gbytes). WB does its own memory and disk
   management. WB is available on swiss-ftp, prep, and indiana as wb1a1.tar.z.

      A Windows version of Scheme called WinScm is forthcoming from
   Vincent Manis of Langara College of BC, Canada. 

      Hobbit is a Scheme-to-C compiler that works with the SCM Scheme
   interpreter. It treats SCM as a C library and integrates compiled
   functions into SCM as new primitives. Hobbit release 2 works with SCM
   release 4b4. Future releases of SCM and Hobbit will be coordinated.
   Hobbit imposes strong restrictions on the higher-order features of
   Scheme. For example, it does not support continuations.  The main aim
   of hobbit is to produce maximally fast C programs which would retain
   most of the original Scheme program structure, making the output C
   program readable and modifiable. Hobbit is written in Scheme and is
   able to self-compile. Hobbit can be obtained via anonymous ftp from

   STk is a R4RS Scheme interpreter which can access the Tk graphical
   package. All of the commands defined by the Tk toolkit are available
   to the STk interpreter, and Tk variables are reflected back into
   Scheme as Scheme variables. Callback is expressed in Scheme. Includes
   a CLOS-like OO extension called STklos, which provides multiple
   inheritance, generic functions, multi methods, and a true meta-object
   protocol.  A set of classes have been defined to manipulate Tk
   commands (menu, buttons, scales, canvas, canvas items) as Scheme
   objects. STk runs on Sparc (SUNOS 4.1.x), Dec 5xxx (Ultrix 4.2), SGI
   (Irix 4.05, 5.1.1), DEC Alpha, and Linux 1.0. STk is available by

   It is Scheme implemented on top of Common Lisp, and runs in Lucid,
   Symbolics CL, VAX Lisp under VMS, and Explorer CL. It should be
   easy to port to other Lisps. It was written by Jonathan Rees
   (jar@altdorf.ai.mit.edu, jar@cs.cornell.edu). Send mail to
   info-clscheme-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu to be put on a mailing list
   for announcements. Conforms to R4RS except for lacking a correct
   implementation of call/cc. It works by running the Scheme code
   through a preprocessor, which generates Common Lisp code.
