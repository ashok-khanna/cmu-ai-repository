R4RS is the Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme,
edited by W. Clinger and J. Rees. It appeared in ACM Lisp Pointers IV,
July-September 1991, and also as MIT AI Memo 848b. It serves as a kind
of standard for the language. It can be obtained by anonymous ftp at
the two Scheme Repositories, swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu and ftp.cs.indiana.edu.

IEEE P1178 is IEEE Standard 1178-1990, "IEEE Standard for the Scheme
