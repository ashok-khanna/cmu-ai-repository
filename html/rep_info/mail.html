<H1>Mailing Lists</H1>

There are several mailing lists associated with the CMU AI Repository.
<P>
The first set of mailing lists are low-volume moderated mailing lists,
and will be used primarily for notification of updates to a particular
section of the repository:
<LISTING>
   lisp-announce	Notification of updates to the Lisp section
   scheme-announce	Notification of updates to the Scheme section
   prolog-announce	Notification of updates to the Prolog section
</LISTING>
The first list replaces the old <I>Lisp-Utilities@cs.cmu.edu</I> mailing list.
<P>
To unsubscribe, send a message to <I>ai+query@cs.cmu.edu</I> with one or more
of the following lines
<LISTING>
   subscribe lisp-announce   YOUR NAME HERE, YOUR COMPANY/UNIVERSITY HERE
   subscribe scheme-announce YOUR NAME HERE, YOUR COMPANY/UNIVERSITY HERE
   subscribe prolog-announce YOUR NAME HERE, YOUR COMPANY/UNIVERSITY HERE
</LISTING>
in the message body.
<P>
Matters concerning the repository as a whole or other sections of the
repository will be posted to the relevant newsgroups.
<P>
The AI Repository also has several other lists:
<LISTING>
   lisp-jobs	Announcements of Lisp job opportunities
   ai-jobs	Announcements of AI job opportunities
   prolog-jobs	Announcements of Prolog job opportunities
   ai-postdoc	Announcements of AI-related post-doctoral fellowships
   ai-predoc	Announcements of AI-related pre-doctoral fellowships
</LISTING>
You can subscribe to them in a similar fashion. Resumes should NOT be
sent to these lists. To send announcements to these lists, send them
to <I>ai+LISTNAME@cs.cmu.edu</I>, where LISTNAME should be replaced with
the relevant mailing list name, e.g. <I>ai+lisp-jobs@cs.cmu.edu</I>.
