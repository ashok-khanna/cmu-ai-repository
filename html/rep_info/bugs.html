<P>
Bug reports, comments, questions and suggestions concerning programs
in the Lisp section of the repository should also be CCed to
<I>Lisp-Utilities-Request@cs.cmu.edu</I>. Please send us copies of any
changes or improvements you make to the software, so that we may merge
them into the originals. Please be patient -- Mark is an nth-year
