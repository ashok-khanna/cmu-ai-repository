<H1>Introduction to the AI Repository</H1>

Welcome to the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository. <P>

The Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by Mark
Kantrowitz in 1993 to collect files, programs and publications of
interest to Artificial Intelligence researchers, educators, and
students. It is an outgrowth of the Lisp Utilities Repository
established by Mark in 1990 and his work on the FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions) postings for the AI, Lisp, Scheme, and Prolog newsgroups.
The Lisp Utilities Repository has been merged into the AI Repository.<P>

We'd like to thank Rich Morin of Prime Time Freeware and Raj Reddy of
Carnegie Mellon University for their enthusiastic support of this
project.<P>

The AI Repository is accessible by anonymous 
<a href="retrieve.html">FTP and AFS</a> without
charge. A subset of the contents of the repository will also be
published by Prime Time Freeware as an inexpensive mixed-media
(Book/CD-ROM) publication. Click <A href="cdrom.html">here</a> 
for more information about the CD-ROM.<P>

The repository contains

      and Scheme
