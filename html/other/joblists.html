<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>
The mailing lists are as follows:
<listing>
   AI-Jobs      Announcements of AI job opportunities
   Lisp-Jobs    Announcements of Lisp job opportunities
   Prolog-Jobs  Announcements of Prolog job opportunities

<h1>To Subscribe</h1>

To subscribe, send a message to <tt>ai+query@cs.cmu.edu</tt> with
<pre>
   subscribe listname your-name, your-affiliation
</pre>
in the message body and no Subject line. Replace <tt>listname</tt> with the name of
the list, <tt>your-name</tt> with your first and last name, and <tt>your-affiliation</tt> with
your current affiliation (optional). For example, to subscribe to the
<tt>AI-Jobs</tt> list I
would include the line
<pre>
   subscribe ai-jobs Mark Kantrowitz, Carnegie Mellon Univ.
</pre>
<p>
If your mailer objects to the "+", send subscription requests to
<tt>"ai+query"@cs.cmu.edu</tt>, job announcements to <tt>"ai+ai-jobs"@cs.cmu.edu</tt>, etc.
<p>
Please do not send subscription requests to the lists themselves.
Although there is a filter on the list that catches most non-job
postings, these get kicked out for me to deal with manually.
<p>
As a matter of policy, the contents of the mailing lists are considered
confidential and will not be disclosed to anybody.

<h1>Submissions</h1>

Material appropriate for the lists includes job announcements and should
be sent to <tt>ai+listname@cs.cmu.edu</tt>, replacing <tt>listname</tt> with the name of the
list. For example, to submit a job posting to the <tt>AI-Jobs</tt> list, send it to
<tt>ai+ai-jobs@cs.cmu.edu</tt>. Resumes should NOT be sent to the list.

<h1>Job Posting Archives</h1>

Job postings sent to the list are automatically archived in
appropriate subdirectories of
<pre>
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/jobs/
</pre>

<h1>Other Questions</h1>

For help on using the query server, send mail to <tt>ai+query@cs.cmu.edu</tt> with
<pre>
   help
</pre>
in the message body and no Subject line.
<p>
If you have any other questions, please send them to <tt>ai+@cs.cmu.edu</tt>
<p>
We would appreciate hearing from anybody who receives a job that they
first heard about through one of these lists.
