<H2>Issue SHARP-COMMA-CONFUSION Writeup</H2>

<PRE><B>Forum:</B>		Compiler<P>
<B>Issue:</B>		<A HREF="iss315.html">SHARP-COMMA-CONFUSION</A><P>
<B>References:</B>	CLtL p. 356<P>
		Issue <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A><P>
<B>Category:</B>	CHANGE<P>
<B>Edit History:</B>   V1, 17 Oct 1988, Sandra Loosemore<P>
		V2, 30 Dec 1988, Sandra Loosemore (comments from Pitman)<P>
<B>Status:</B>		Proposal <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_removecm__elete-if-not.html#remove"><B>REMOVE</B></A> passed Jan 89<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
The way the read macro #, is defined in CLtL does not make it clear<P>
that it can only appear inside of (implicitly) quoted <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/stagenfun_doc_umentationcp.html#structure"><B>structure</B></A> to<P>
guarantee consistent handling between the interpreter and the<P>
compiler.  Examples of inconsistent uses would be #, forms appearing<P>
outside of a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_quote.html#quote"><B>QUOTE</B></A> that expand into list or symbol forms that could be<P>
interpreted as code, or strings that could be interpreted as<P>
documentation strings.  Users are even more likely to be confused<P>
because the wording in CLtL compares the behavior of #, to the special<P>
form <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_eval-when.html#eval-when"><B>EVAL-WHEN</B></A>, which must appear in a for-evaluation position.<P>
<P>
#, also presents a serious problem to program-analyzing programs<P>
because evaluation is tied to the reader, rather than the interpreter<P>
or compiler.  In theory, this could be handled by altering the read table<P>
to have #, construct a &quot;magic cookie&quot; instead of performing read-time<P>
evaluation and having the code walker examine quoted structures, but I've<P>
never seen this actually done in practice.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Proposal SHARP-COMMA-CONFUSION:REMOVE:<P>
</B><P>
Remove the #, read macro from the language.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
Removing #, is simpler than trying to redefine it.  Removing it from<P>
the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A>, rather than redefining it to mean something else (see<P>
issue <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A>), would allow implementations to continue to<P>
<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> it as an extension.  (Although CLtL does not appear to<P>
explicitly address the question of whether implementations may extend<P>
the reader syntax, some implementations already <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> sharp-sign<P>
read macros other than those described in CLtL, such as #P syntax for<P>
pathnames.)<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
#, is not used very frequently, but the functionality it provides is<P>
important in some advanced applications; one such application that has<P>
been cited is CLOS.  Maintainers of such applications have generally<P>
expressed a willingness to give up #, only if a suitable alternative<P>
is offered (see issue <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A>).<P>
<P>
PSL/PCLS has never bothered to implement #, correctly (it's treated<P>
just like #.), and nobody has ever complained about it being broken.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to implementors:<P>
</B><P>
None.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to users:<P>
</B><P>
Because #, is used so infrequently, most users would probably not even<P>
notice its absence.<P>
<P>
Issue <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A> proposes to add a special form that would <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A><P>
a somewhat cleaner mechanism for load-time evaluation.<P>
<P>
It is also possible to use a global variable to get the similar effect as<P>
#,, although this is sometimes awkward and carries a space and <P>
performance penalty in many implementations.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
The language specification is simplified by removing a peculiar<P>
feature of the language that is accessible only through the reader.<P>
<P>
Removing #, may also allow simpler strategies for implementing<P>
compiled file loaders to be used.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
If this proposal is rejected, the definition of #, in the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_7-6-6-2.html#standard"><B>standard</B></A> will<P>
still need to be clarified to indicate that #, can only appear in<P>
quoted <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/stagenfun_doc_umentationcp.html#structure"><B>structure</B></A>.  It should probably also include some mention of the<P>
problems that #, can cause code walkers.<P>
<P>
Kent Pitman says:<P>
<P>
  I approve of the ideas being discussed, but ONLY contingent on<P>
  <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_load-time-value.html#load-time-value"><B>LOAD-TIME-VALUE</B></A> being introduced.<P>
<P>
  I am optimistic that <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A> will pass, and so I don't think this<P>
  will keep #, from passing, but:<P>
   - I want people who vote for this to realize the importance of voting<P>
     for <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A>.<P>
   - On the off chance <A HREF="iss216-menu.html">LOAD-TIME-EVAL</A> doesn't pass, I want people to have<P>
     been warned that the consequences were severe for some major <P>
     applications.<P>
   - I want the records to reflect the actual rationale people should and <P>
     hopefully will be using to make these decisions.<P>
