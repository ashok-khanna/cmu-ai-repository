<H2>Issue ISO-COMPATIBILITY Writeup</H2>

<PRE><B>Issue:</B>        <A HREF="iss198.html">ISO-COMPATIBILITY</A><P>
<B>Forum:</B>	      X3J13 Letter Ballot<P>
<B>References:</B>   ISO SC22/WG16 Committee Draft<P>
<B>Category:</B>     CHANGE<P>
<B>Edit history:</B> 16-Jun-93, Version 1 by Pitman<P>
<B>Status:</B>       Proposal ADD-SUBSTRATE passed 8-3 on letter ballot 93-304.<P>
<P>
<B>Problem Description:<P>
</B><P>
  The ISO specification for ISLISP contains features which cannot be <P>
  straightforwardly implemented in ANSI Common Lisp, but that with<P>
  minor changes could be.<P>
<P>
Proposal (<A HREF="iss198.html">ISO-COMPATIBILITY:ADD-SUBSTRATE</A>)<P>
<P>
  1. Add a new macro:<P>
<P>
     <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> name form		[Macro]<P>
<P>
     Globally defines a symbol macro named &lt;name&gt; which expands <P>
     to &lt;form&gt;.<P>
<P>
  2. Add a new macro:<P>
<P>
     <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> lambda-list &amp;body declarations-and-forms    [Macro]<P>
<P>
     The form (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>lambda</B></A> ...) is shorthand for #'(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>lambda</B></A> ...).<P>
<P>
<B>Test Case:<P>
</B><P>
  Sample code to better illustrate the issue goes here.<P>
<P>
<B>Rationale:<P>
</B><P>
  This makes it possible to implement ISO's ISLISP dialect entirely<P>
  in portable code.<P>
<P>
  1. <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> can be used to define global lexicals, <P>
     by having a global lexical be a symbol macro that expands <P>
     into a reference to a globally allocated cell that is not<P>
     subject to dynamic binding.<P>
<P>
     <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> can also be used to define the ISLISP<P>
     notion of a compiler constant, which is a variable that<P>
     cannot be assigned but that CAN be bound.  The implementation<P>
     is the same as for global lexicals, except that the expansion<P>
     form is not SETF-able.<P>
<P>
  2. A <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A>, although conceptually trivial, cannot be defined by <P>
     users because issue <A HREF="iss214.html">LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION</A> places restrictions<P>
     on users' ability to add definitions to symbols in the CL package.<P>
<P>
  Also, each of these features is independently useful in its own right.<P>
<P>
  1. <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> has been requested by some users.<P>
     For example, see Public Review comment Pitman #10.<P>
<P>
     Some users have also requested global lexicals, <P>
     especially those from the Scheme community.<P>
     For example, see Public Review comment Loosemore #30.<P>
<P>
     Some users have also requested ISLISP-style constants,<P>
     especially those from the Eulisp community.<P>
     For example, see Public Review comment Dalton #4.<P>
<P>
   2. A <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> macro has been requested by many users,<P>
      especially, but not at all exclusively, those from the<P>
      Scheme and Eulisp communities.<P>
      Issue LAMBDA-FORM previously failed before this committee,<P>
      however at a time when the compatibility issue with other <P>
      Lisp standards was not as great a concern.  It's appropriate<P>
      that the concept be reconsidered again here in this new light.<P>
<P>
<B>Current Practice:<P>
</B><P>
  1. Symbolics Genera provides <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> as an <P>
     implementation-depednent extension.<P>
<P>
  2. Symbolics Genera has long provided a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> macro, which was<P>
     permitted as an extention under CLtL, but not the dpANS.  Users<P>
     were upset when this was not only taken away from them, but they<P>
     were forbidden from creating it anew.  (It's quite a complicated <P>
     symbol to be shadowing.)<P>
<P>
     Most Lisp dialects don't <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/fun_providecm_require.html#provide"><B>provide</B></A> a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> macro since doing so <P>
     would be a violation of the spec.<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Implementors:<P>
</B><P>
  1. Relatively small.<P>
<P>
  2. Very small.  <P>
       (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_defmacro.html#defmacro"><B>DEFMACRO</B></A> <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_3-4-4.html#AMwhole"><B>&amp;WHOLE</B></A> FORM <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sec_3-4-1.html#AMrest"><B>&amp;REST</B></A> BVL-DECLS-AND-BODY)<P>
	  (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/sym_declare.html#declare"><B>DECLARE</B></A> (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/dec_ignorecm_ignorable.html#ignore"><B>IGNORE</B></A> BVL-DECLS-AND-BODY))<P>
	  `#',FORM)<P>
<P>
<B>Cost to Users:<P>
</B><P>
  1. None.  (This change is upward compatible.)<P>
<P>
  2. Very small.  (Mostly the need to remove any compatibility definition<P>
      they might already have, in spite of warnings that they should not<P>
      have such a thing.)<P>
<P>
<B>Cost of Non-Adoption:<P>
</B><P>
  The relation of ANSI CL to ISLISP would be difficult to explain.  Neither is<P>
  a subset of the other, so they would appear as competing dialects and it might<P>
  be a hassle for some vendors to explain off the lack of coordination. <P>
<P>
<B>Benefits:<P>
</B><P>
  If we can say that ANSI CL is capable of implementing ISLISP, <P>
  then ISLISP becomes a substantially reduced threat in some situations.<P>
<P>
<B>Editorial Impact:<P>
</B><P>
  Relatively small.<P>
<P>
  1. Changes to the description of how symbol macros are processed.<P>
     A new dictionary entry for the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> macro.<P>
<P>
  2. A new dictionary entry for the <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> macro.<P>
<P>
<B>Aesthetics:<P>
</B><P>
  1. Having <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/mac_define-symbol-macro.html#define-symbol-macro"><B>DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO</B></A> as a companion to <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/speope_symbol-macrolet.html#symbol-macrolet"><B>SYMBOL-MACROLET</B></A> seems<P>
     to make things simpler to explain, since users often expect there<P>
     to be both definers and binders for things in the environment.<P>
<P>
  2. People are mixed on the aesthetics of this:<P>
<P>
     - Some people think a <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> form is massively more aesthetic.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> is something primitive, not something<P>
	to be layered on as an afterthought with macro technology.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think having both (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A>  ...) and #'(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...)<P>
	is extra baggage that look silly.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think having both (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...) and #'(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...)<P>
	provides expressional flexibility to two camps who won't be <P>
	content to settle on a single solution.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think having (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...) brings them uncomfortably<P>
	close to having to fight the Lisp1/Lisp2 battle over again.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think having (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...) only makes sense in the<P>
	Lisp1 context.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think having (<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...) ameliorates one of the <P>
	aggravating problems seen by Lisp1-fans, which is the need to<P>
	write #' in front of things.  It doesn't get rid of all of them,<P>
	but it does get rid of many.<P>
<P>
     - Some people think that not having to write #'(<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> ...) may<P>
	lead to further confusion down the road in understanding why the<P>
	<A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/acc_carcm_cdr_darcm_cddddr.html#car"><B>car</B></A> of a form is treated differently than other parts of the form.<P>
<P>
     There is not likely to be consensus from an absolute point of view <P>
     on this.  It is clear that there is no way to optimize aesthetic<P>
     criteria related to <A REL=DEFINITION HREF="../Body/any_lambda.html#lambda"><B>LAMBDA</B></A> in a way that satisfies everyone.<P>
<P>
     Pitman thinks this means that people should prefer to add the macro<P>
     since it permits maximal flexibility of style to users at extremely<P>
     low cost to implementors.<P>
<P>
<B>Discussion:<P>
</B><P>
  This comment addresses the following Public Review comments:<P>
    Dalton #4<P>
    Pitman #10<P>
    Pitman #32<P>
    Loosemore #30<P>
  Pitman strongly supports this proposal.<P>
<P>
  The data for this proposal was generated from an experiment:<P>
  As a test, since the dialects were similar, Pitman implemented an <P>
  approximate version of ISLISP in Common Lisp.  The exercise took <P>
  only a few hours to code up.  In a few places, Pitman had to use<P>
  implementation-specific techniques to compensate for missing <P>
  functionality. The items mentioned in this proposal are the things<P>
  he would have needed in Common Lisp in order not to have needed<P>
  implementation-specific substrate.<P>
<P>
  It's arguable that things like QUASIQUOTE, UNQUOTE, and<P>
  UNQUOTE-SPLICING should appear in this proposal as well.  However,<P>
  technically, those can be written straightforwardly in CL, so they<P>
  were omitted for reasons of minimalism in order to improve the<P>
  likelihood of this passing.  However, we might want to seriously<P>
  consider them separately since they did get mentioned in other Public<P>
  Review comments as a compatibility issue for Scheme users.<P>
<P>
