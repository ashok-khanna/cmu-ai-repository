Common Lisp became an official ANSI Standard on December 8, 1994:
<A REL=CITATION HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/tc_sd4/x3j13sd4.html">
<em>ANSI X3.226:1994 American National Standard for Programming
Language Common LISP (X3J13)</em></a>. Copies of the ANSI/X3.226 
standard, which is nearly 1,100 pages long,
may be purchased from the American National Standards Institute,
11 West 42nd Street, New York, NY 10036. 
For more information, visit the ANSI home page at 
<a href="http://www.ansi.org/">http://www.ansi.org/</a>.
<p>
A web version of the ANSI Common Lisp standard is not available. The
official ANSI standard is available only in hardcopy form.
<p>
However, <a href="mailto:kmp@harlequin.com">Kent Pitman</a>
of <A HREF="http://www.harlequin.com/">Harlequin, Inc.</a>
has written an HTML document that is derived (with permission
from <A HREF="http://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.x3.org/">X3</A>) from the
<A REL=CITATION HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/tc_sd4/x3j13sd4.html">
ANSI Common Lisp standard (X3.226)</A>
and 
<A HREF="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/cl/cleanup/">
related design documents</A>. As Project Editor of 
<A HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/x3j13.html">X3J13</A>
Kent Pitman managed the completion of the document which became the
<A REL=CITATION HREF="http://www.x3.org/tc_home/tc_sd4/x3j13sd4.html">
ANSI Common Lisp Standard</A>.

casual browsing. It is available for online browsing 
from <a href="http://www.harlequin.com/books/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">Harlequin</a>
or the <a href="HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index-2.html">CMU AI Repository</a>.

and get much better performance.  The 
<a href="clspec30.gz">gzipped tar file</a> is
just a little over 2MB, and unpacks into a set of about 2,300 files
that is just a little over 15MB and contains approximately 105,000 links.
