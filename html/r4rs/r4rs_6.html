<P>
A Scheme expression is a construct that returns a value, such as a
variable reference, literal, procedure call, or conditional.
<P>
Expression types are categorized as <EM>primitive</EM> or <EM>derived</EM>.
Primitive expression types include variables and procedure calls.
Derived expression types are not semantically primitive, but can instead
be explained in terms of the primitive constructs as in
section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC78">derived expression types</A>.  They are redundant in the strict sense of
the word, but they capture common patterns of usage, and are therefore
provided as convenient abbreviations.

An expression consisting of a variable
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<P>
(section <A HREF="r4rs_5.html#SEC20">Variables and regions</A>) is a variable reference.  The value of
the variable reference is the value stored in the location to which the
variable is bound.  It is an error to reference an
unbound

As noted in section <A HREF="r4rs_5.html#SEC24">Storage model</A>, it is an error to alter a constant

A procedure call is written by simply enclosing in parentheses
expressions for the procedure to be called and the arguments to be
passed to it.  The operator and operand expressions are evaluated (in an
unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed the resulting
arguments.

A number of procedures are available as the values of variables in the
initial environment; for example, the addition and multiplication
procedures in the above examples are the values of the variables
<CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>*</CODE>.

New procedures are created by evaluating lambda expressions (see section
section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC30">Lambda expressions</A>).
<P>
Procedure calls are also called <EM>combinations</EM>.
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>  In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the operand
expressions are always evaluated with the same evaluation rules.
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>  Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of
any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is
constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.
The order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each procedure call.
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>  In many dialects of Lisp, the empty combination,
<CODE>()</CODE>, is a legitimate expression.  In Scheme, combinations must
have at
least one subexpression, so <CODE>()</CODE> is not a syntactically valid
expression.

A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.  The environment in
effect when the lambda expression was evaluated is remembered as part of the
procedure.  When the procedure is later called with some actual
arguments, the environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated will
be extended by binding the variables in the formal argument list to
fresh locations, the corresponding actual argument values will be stored
in those locations, and the expressions in the body of the lambda expression
will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.  The result
of the last expression in the body will be returned as the result of
the procedure call.

<P>
&#60;Formals&#62; should have one of the following forms:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>(&#60;variable 1&#62; ...)</CODE>:
The procedure takes a fixed number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the arguments will be stored in the bindings of the
corresponding variables.

<LI>&#60;variable&#62;:
The procedure takes any number of arguments; when the procedure is
called, the sequence of actual arguments is converted into a newly
allocated list, and the list is stored in the binding of the
&#60;variable&#62;.

<LI><CODE>(&#60;variable 1&#62; ... &#60;variable n-1&#62; . &#60;variable n&#62;)</CODE>:
If a space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then
the value stored in the binding of the last variable will be a
newly allocated
list of the actual arguments left over after all the other actual
arguments have been matched up against the other formal arguments.

It is an error for a &#60;variable&#62; to appear more than once in

One restriction on <CODE>letrec</CODE> is very important: it must be possible
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
to evaluate each &#60;init&#62; without assigning or referring to the value of any
&#60;variable&#62;.  If this restriction is violated, then it is an error.  The
restriction is necessary because Scheme passes arguments by value rather than by
name.  In the most common uses of <CODE>letrec</CODE>, all the &#60;init&#62;s are
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
lambda expressions and the restriction is satisfied automatically.

<CODE>Do</CODE> is an iteration construct.  It specifies a set of variables to
be bound, how they are to be initialized at the start, and how they are
to be updated on each iteration.  When a termination condition is met,
the loop exits with a specified result value.
<P>
<CODE>Do</CODE> expressions are evaluated as follows:
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
The &#60;init&#62; expressions are evaluated (in some unspecified order),
the &#60;variable&#62;s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
&#60;init&#62; expressions are stored in the bindings of the
&#60;variable&#62;s, and then the iteration phase begins.
<P>
Each iteration begins by evaluating &#60;test&#62;; if the result is
false (see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC46">Booleans</A>), then the &#60;command&#62;
expressions are evaluated in order for effect, the &#60;step&#62;
expressions are evaluated in some unspecified order, the
&#60;variable&#62;s are bound to fresh locations, the results of the
&#60;step&#62;s are stored in the bindings of the
&#60;variable&#62;s, and the next iteration begins.
<P>
If &#60;test&#62; evaluates to a true value, then the
&#60;expression&#62;s are evaluated from left to right and the value of
the last &#60;expression&#62; is returned as the value of the <CODE>do</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
expression.  If no &#60;expression&#62;s are present, then the value of
the <CODE>do</CODE> expression is unspecified.
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<P>
The region
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
of the binding of a &#60;variable&#62; consists of the entire <CODE>do</CODE>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>

variables.
<P>
A &#60;step&#62; may be omitted, in which case the effect is the

"Backquote" or "quasiquote"
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
expressions are useful
for constructing a list or vector structure when most but not all of the
desired structure is known in advance.  If no
commas
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
appear within the &#60;template&#62;, the result of evaluating
<CODE>`&#60;template&#62;</CODE> is equivalent to the result of evaluating
<CODE>'&#60;template&#62;</CODE>.  If a comma
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
appears within the
&#60;template&#62;, however, the expression following the comma is
evaluated ("unquoted") and its result is inserted into the structure
instead of the comma and the expression.  If a comma appears followed
immediately by an at-sign (@),
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
then the following
expression must evaluate to a list; the opening and closing parentheses
of the list are then "stripped away" and the elements of the list are
inserted in place of the comma at-sign expression sequence.

Quasiquote forms may be nested.  Substitutions are made only for
unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level
as the outermost backquote.  The nesting level increases by one inside
each successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each
unquotation.
