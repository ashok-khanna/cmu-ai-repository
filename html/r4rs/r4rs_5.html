<H1><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC19">Basic concepts</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC20">Variables and regions</A></H2>
<P>
Any identifier that is not a syntactic keyword
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
(see section <A HREF="r4rs_4.html#SEC16">Identifiers</A>) may be used as a variable.
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
A variable may name a location where a value can be stored.  A variable
that does so is said to be <EM>bound</EM> to the location.  The set of all
visible bindings
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
in effect at some point in a program is known as the <EM>environment</EM>
in effect at that point.  The value stored in the location to which a
variable is bound is called the variable's value.  By abuse of
terminology, the variable is sometimes said to name the value or to be
bound to the value.  This is not quite accurate, but confusion rarely
results from this practice.
<P>
Certain expression types are used to create new locations and to bind
variables to those locations.  The most fundamental of these
<EM>binding constructs</EM>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
is the lambda expression, because all other binding constructs can be
explained in terms of lambda expressions.  The other binding constructs
are <CODE>let</CODE>, <CODE>let*</CODE>, <CODE>letrec</CODE>, and <CODE>do</CODE> expressions
(see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC30">Lambda expressions</A>, section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC35">Binding constructs</A>, and
section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC37">Iteration</A>).
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<P>
Like Algol and Pascal, and unlike most other dialects of Lisp except for
Common Lisp, Scheme is a statically scoped language with block
structure.  To each place where a variable is bound in a program there
corresponds a <DFN>region</DFN> of the program text within which the binding
is effective.  The region is determined by the particular binding
construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is established by
a lambda expression, for example, then its region is the entire lambda
expression.  Every reference to or assignment of a variable refers to
the binding of the variable that established the innermost of the
regions containing the use.  If there is no binding of the variable
whose region contains the use, then the use refers to the binding for
the variable in the top level environment, if any (section
section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC45">Standard procedures</A>); if there is no binding for the identifier,
it is said to be <DFN>unbound</DFN>.
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC21">True and false</A></H2>
<P>
Any Scheme value can be used as a boolean value for the purpose of a
conditional test.  As explained in section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC46">Booleans</A>, all
values count as true in such a test except for <CODE>#f</CODE>.
This report uses the word "true" to refer to any
Scheme value that counts as true, and the word "false" to refer to
<CODE>#f</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM>  In some implementations the empty list also counts as
false instead of true.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC22">External representations</A></H2>
<P>
An important concept in Scheme (and Lisp) is that of the <EM>external
representation</EM> of an object as a sequence of characters.  For example,
an external representation of the integer 28 is the sequence of
characters "<CODE>28</CODE>", and an external representation of a list consisting
of the integers 8 and 13 is the sequence of characters "<CODE>(8 13)</CODE>".
<P>
The external representation of an object is not necessarily unique.  The
integer 28 also has representations "<CODE>#e28.000</CODE>" and
"<CODE>#x1c</CODE>", and the list in the previous paragraph also has the
representations "<CODE>( 08 13 )</CODE>" and "<CODE>(8 . (13 . ()))</CODE>"
(see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC48">Pairs and lists</A>).
<P>
Many objects have standard external representations, but some, such as
procedures, do not have standard representations (although particular
implementations may define representations for them).
<P>
An external representation may be written in a program to obtain the
corresponding object (see <CODE>quote</CODE>, section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC28">Literal expressions</A>).
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<P>
External representations can also be used for input and output.  The
procedure <CODE>read</CODE> (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC63">Input</A>) parses external
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
representations, and the procedure <CODE>Output</CODE> (section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC64">Output</A>)
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
generates them.  Together, they provide an elegant and powerful
input/output facility.
<P>
Note that the sequence of characters "<CODE>(+ 2 6)</CODE>" is <EM>not</EM> an
external representation of the integer 8, even though it <EM>is</EM> an
expression evaluating to the integer 8; rather, it is an external
representation of a three-element list, the elements of which are the symbol
<CODE>+</CODE> and the integers 2 and 6.  Scheme's syntax has the property that
any sequence of characters that is an expression is also the external
representation of some object.  This can lead to confusion, since it may
not be obvious out of context whether a given sequence of characters is
intended to denote data or program, but it is also a source of power,
since it facilitates writing programs such as interpreters and
compilers that treat programs as data (or vice versa).
<P>
The syntax of external representations of various kinds of objects
accompanies the description of the primitives for manipulating the
objects in the appropriate sections of section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC45">Standard procedures</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC23">Disjointness of types</A></H2>
<P>
No object satisfies more than one of the following predicates:
<P>
<PRE>
boolean?          pair?
symbol?           number?
char?             string?
vector?           procedure?
</PRE>
<P>
These predicates define the types <EM>boolean</EM>, <EM>pair</EM>,
<EM>symbol</EM>, <EM>number</EM>, <EM>char</EM> (or <EM>character</EM>),
<EM>string</EM>, <EM>vector</EM>, and <EM>procedure</EM>.
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#SEC24">Storage model</A></H2>
<P>
Variables and objects such as pairs, vectors, and strings implicitly
denote locations
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
or sequences of locations.  A string, for
example, denotes as many locations as there are characters in the string.
(These locations need not correspond to a full machine word.) A new value may be
stored into one of these locations using the <CODE>string-set!</CODE> procedure, but
the string continues to denote the same locations as before.
<P>
An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by
a procedure such as <CODE>car</CODE>, <CODE>vector-ref</CODE>, or <CODE>string-ref</CODE>, is
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
equivalent in the sense of <CODE>eqv?</CODE> (section
section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC47">Equivalence predicates</A>)
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
to the object last stored in the location before the fetch.
<P>
Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.
No variable or object ever refers to a location that is not in use.
Whenever this report speaks of storage being allocated for a variable
or object, what is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are
chosen from the set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen
locations are marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable
or object is made to denote them.
<P>
In many systems it is desirable for constants
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
(i.e. the values of
literal expressions) to reside in read-only-memory.  To express this, it is
convenient to imagine that every object that denotes locations is associated
with a flag telling whether that object is mutable
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
or immutable.
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
The constants and the strings returned by <CODE>symbol-&#62;string</CODE> are
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
then the immutable objects, while all objects created by the other
procedures listed in this report are mutable.  It is an error to attempt
to store a new value into a location that is denoted by an immutable
object.
