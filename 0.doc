Summary:      CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository

Description:

   Welcome to the CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository.
   
   The AI Repository was established by Mark Kantrowitz in 1993 to
   collect free software and materials of general interest to AI
   researchers, educators, students, and practitioners.
   
   If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
   this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
   important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
   of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
   signify your agreement to these conditions.
   
   This directory contains six annotation files and several directories:
   
      0.all                     Concatenation of the repository's 0.doc files
      0.ask                     Abbreviated version of 0.all
      0.doc                     Top-level documentation (this file)
      readme.txt                Read this file before using the AI Repository
      file_ext.txt              File extensions in use in the repository
      ls-Rla.gz                 Results of running ls -Rla on the repository
   
      copying/                  GNU GPL and other copyright notices
      doc/                      Help with ftp, bitftp, ftpmail, etc.
      util/                     Compression and archiving software
      html/                     Mosaic-related documents, FAQ files, etc.
      ptfai/                    Administrative sub-directory
      new/                      For contributing files to the repository
                       
      <topic>                   sub-directory for <topic>
      ...
   
   The remaining directories are the tops of topical directory trees.  These
   are (typically) structured as follows:
   
     a/
       0.doc                     documentation file for topic a
       aa/
         0.doc                   documentation file for topic aa
         aaa/
           0.doc                 documentation file for package aaa
           0.iso                 ISO-9660 file name correspondence table
           0.lst                 summary listing file for package aaa
           aaa.lzv                      verbose listing of aaa.zip
           aaa.zip               Info-zipped archive
       ab/
         ...
   
   There are some definite flaws with the current hierarchy, principally
   stemming from limitations in the ISO-9660 file system and differences
   between CD-ROM and FTP archive structuring priorities.  We expect to
   rearrange things in the future, so let us know your preferences...

              Copying of the 0.doc files is generally permitted, (e.g., they
              may be included on mirror sites for the CMU AI Repository),
              except that THE 0.DOC FILES MAY NOT BE USED TO PRODUCE A
