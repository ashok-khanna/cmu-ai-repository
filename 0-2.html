Summary:      This is the top level directory of the disc.

Description:

  This directory contains three annotation files and several directories:

    /<mount point>
      0.all                     concatenation of the release's 0.doc files
      0.ask                     abbreviated version of 0.all
      0.doc                     top-level documentation (this file)
      a2z                       administrative sub-directory
      <topic>                   sub-directory for <topic>
      ...

  The a2z directory contains administrative files which should be inspected
  before any attempt is made to use the disc.  In addition, the book should
  be read for hints on using the disc.  a2z is laid out as follows:

    a2z/
      0.doc                     documentation file for directory a2z
      bin                       scripts for using the disc
      doc                       assorted reference text files
      lists                     lists of packages, etc.
      origins                   information on package origins

  We do not supply a browser, because we don't yet know how to do one in a
  convenient and portable fashion.  For the present, we suggest that you use
  your favorite text editor on the 0.all or 0.ask file.

  The remaining directories are the tops of topical directory trees.  These
  are (typically) structured as follows:

    a/
      0.doc                     documentation file for topic a
      aa/
        0.doc                   documentation file for topic aa
        aaa/
          0.doc                 documentation file for package aaa
          0.iso                 ISO-9660 file name correspondence table
          0.lst                 summary listing file for package aaa
          aaa.lzv      		verbose listing of aaa.zip
          aaa.zip               Info-zipped archive
      ab/
        ...

  There are some definite flaws with the current hierarchy, principally
  stemming from limitations in the ISO-9660 file system and differences
  between CD-ROM and FTP archive structuring priorities.  We expect to
  rearrange things in future releases, so let us know your preferences...

Description:    Administrative directory for the disc

Notes:

  This directory contains administrative files which should be inspected
  before any attempt is made to use the disc.  Some files, particularly those
  in the docs directory, should probably be printed out for easy reference.

Contains:

  bin           shell scripts to assist in using the disc
  doc           text files documenting the disc as a whole
  lists         lists of packages, etc.

Summary:        Shell scripts to assist in using the disc

Description:

  These scripts are intended to help you find and install packages, and
  otherwise work with the disc.  Feel free to adapt them to your own needs,
  if they do not currently do what you wish.  Let us know about any bugs or
  other opportunities for improvement:  ptf-bugs@cfcl.com

  Much of the complexity in these scripts results from the fact that there
  are four distinct decisions a UNIX vendor can make in presenting ISO-9660
  file names to the user.  The decisions are whether or not to:

        hide version numbers
        map alphabetic characters to lower case
        hide trailing periods when no extension exists

  A given ISO-9660 file (e.g., "FOO.;1") may thus be displayed by your UNIX
  system in any of eight possible ways:

        foo             foo.            foo;1           foo.;1
        FOO             FOO.            FOO;1           FOO.;1

  Because ISO-9660 files have no permission bits, vendors also get to chose
  among some 4096 (2^12) possible mode combinations.  Worse, some vendors do
  not allow direct execution of scripts, even when the mode allows it.  We
  have therefore decided to assume mode 444 (r--r--r--).

  We have attempted to make our scripts work in all cases.  We try to handle
  all case, mode, and version number variations.  By ensuring that all our
  file names have extensions, we eliminate the trailing period problem.  We
  may have failed in some respect, however, or your vendor may have created
  yet another case.  If so, please let us know (ptf-bugs@cfcl.com).

Package:      areas/agents/animals/

Name:         ANIMALS

Summary:      Computer simulations of animal behavior (Toby Tyrrell)

Version:      

Description: 

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell for his PhD
   thesis.  The thesis examines the problem of action selection when
   dealing with realistic, animal-like situations: how to choose, at each
   moment in time, the most appropriate out of a repertoire of possible
   actions.  It includes a description is given of a simulated
   environment which is an extensive and detailed simulation of the
   problem of action selection for animals.  This simulated environment
   is used to investigate the adequacy of several theories of action
   selection (from both ethology and artificial intelligence) such as the
   drive model, Lorenz's psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading
   activation network, and outlines deficiencies in each mechanism.
   Finally, it proposes a new approach to action selection is developed
   which determines the most appropriate action in a principled way, and
   which does not suffer from the inherent shortcomings found in other
   methods. The thesis includes a review and bibliography of existing
   work on action selection.

   The action selection problem modeled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing,
   not getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc.), many internal
   and external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

Description: 

   This directory contains an implementation of AOP, an interpreter for
   programs written in AGENT0. AGENT0 is a programming language based on
   Yoav Shoham's Agent-Oriented Programming Paradigm. AOP includes a nice
   GUI based on MCT (Mark's CLX Toolkit). A demo of an airplane agent is

Package:      areas/agents/viewgen/

Name:         ViewGen

Summary:      Viewpoint Generator

Version:      

Description: 

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see
   References).  This can be seen as a form of agent modeling tool,
   which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep nested belief
   spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs that are
   typically held by groups of agents.

   The theory of belief ascription upon which ViewGen is based is
   described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general 
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation. See the
   readme.txt file for an abstract.

Description: 

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  BIOSIM includes a graphical user interface and was
   designed for research and teaching.

   NOTE: This is *not* the BIOSIM program of Per Hammarlund (Sweden).

Description: 

   BUGS is a simple interactive genetic algorithms program. The system
   displays critters on the screen (graphs of Fourier Series) and lets
   the user select fit ones with the mouse. It is written in the spirit
   of Richard Dawkins' celebrated Blind Watchmaker software.  Breeding is
   by the genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation.
   Illustrates genetic drift and premature convergence.

Package:      areas/alife/systems/echo/

Name:         Echo

Summary:      Model of agent interactions

Version:      1.0 (23-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Echo is a model of complex adaptive systems proposed by John Holland,
   in which virtually all of the physical details of real systems have
   been abstracted away. Instead, it concentrates on a small set of
   primitive agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. The goal of
   Echo is to study how simple interactions among simple agents lead to
   emergent high-level complex phenomena such as the flow of resources in
   a system or cooperation and competition in networks of agents (e.g.,
   communities, trading networks, or arms races).

Description: 

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  XODUS is a graphical front end for
   GENESIS. 

   The distribution includes full source code and documentation for both
   GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen demonstration and tutorial
   simulations.  Documentation for these simulations is included, along
   with three papers that describe the general organization of the
   simulator.

   Also included is a set of "Rallpacks" benchmarks for speed
   and accuracy of the simulation. The three sets of benchmarks model a
   linear passive cable with many compartments, a highly branched cable, and
   a linear axon containing Hodgkin-Huxley channels.  The simulator results
   may be compared to the exact analytic solutions (for the first two cases)
   and to the results given by GENESIS and by NEURON, another popular neural
   simulator.  (The results for these two simulators show nearly identical
   speed and accuracy.)

   The GENESIS Users Group, BABEL, provides some informal support to
   GENESIS users. BABEL members have access to an email list, a repository
   of contributions by GENESIS users and developers, new simulations,
   libraries of cells and channels, additional simulator components, new
   documentation and tutorials, and bug reports and fixes. Membership
   requires a one-time $200 registration fee made payable to the California
   Institute of Technology and sent to Jim Bower, Computational Neural
   Systems Program, 216-76, Caltech, Pasadena, CA, 91125.  Please provide
   name, institution, mailing address, phone number, an email address for
   the mailing list, and an account name for use on the BABEL computer.

Summary:      Implementations of Conway's Game of Life

Description:

   This directory contains a large collection of implementations of
   Conway's Game of Life for Unix, IBM PC, Amiga, and other systems.

   Cellular Automata, of which Life is an example, were suggested by
   Stanislaw Ulam in the 1940s, and first formalized by von Neumann.
   Conway's "Game of Life" was popularized in Martin Gardner's
   mathematical games column in the October 1970 and February 1971 issues
   of Scientific American.  (Shorter notes on life are also given in the
   column in each month from October 1970 to April 1971, and well as
   November 1971, January 1972, and December 1972.) There's also quite a
   bit on the game in "The Recursive Universe", by William Poundstone,
   Oxford University Press, 1987, 252 pages.

   The rules for the game of life are quite simple. The game board is a
   rectangular cell array, with each cell either empty or filled. At each
   tick of the clock, we generate the next generation by the following rules:

           if a cell is empty, fill it if 3 of its neighbors are filled
           (otherwise leave it empty)

           if a cell is filled, it
                   dies of loneliness if it has 1 or fewer neighbors
                   continues to live if it has 2 or 3 neighbors
                   dies of overcrowding if it has more than 3 neighbors

   Neighbors include the cells on the diagonals. Some implementations use
   a torus-based array (edges joined top-to-bottom and left-to-right) for
   computing neighbors.

   For example, a row of 3 filled cells will become a column of 3 filled
   cells in the next generation. The R pentomino is an interesting
   pattern:
         xx
        xx
         x
   Try it with other patterns of 5 cells initially occupied. If you
   record the ages of cells, and map the ages to colors, you can get a
   variety of beautiful images.

   When implementing Life, be sure to maintain separate arrays for the
   old and new generation. Updating the array in place will not work
   correctly. Another optimization to to maintain a list of the cells
   that changed.

   Conway has demonstrated that it is possible to construct the basic
   building blocks of a computer from Life using modified glider guns.

      Ways", Academic Press, New York, 1982, ISBN 0-120911-507.

Description: 

   Primordial Soup is an artificial life program similar in concept to
   Thomas Ray's Tierra system. Organisms are computer software loops that
   live in a shared memory space and self-reproduce. The organisms mutate
   and evolve, behaving in accordance with the principles of Darwinian
   evolution.  Since the memory space is shared, multiple organisms can
   execute the same program or program fragments, and can overwrite each
   other in part or in whole.

Package:      areas/alife/systems/tierra/

Name:         Tierra

Summary:      Evolution of digital organisms

Version:      4.0 (16-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.

   This system results in the production of synthetic organisms based on
   a computer metaphor of organic life in which CPU time is the
   ``energy'' resource and memory is the ``material'' resource.  Memory
   is organized into informational patterns that exploit CPU time for
   self-replication.  Mutation generates new forms, and evolution
   proceeds by natural selection as different genotypes compete for CPU
   time and memory space. Diverse ecological communities have emerged.

Summary:      Adaptive Simulated Annealing 

Version:      3.12 (29-APR-94)

Description: 

   ASA (Adaptive Simulated Annealing) is a powerful global optimization
   C-code algorithm especially useful for nonlinear and/or stochastic
   systems. 

   ASA is developed to statistically find the best global fit of a
   nonlinear non-convex cost-function over a D-dimensional space. This
   algorithm permits an annealing schedule for 'temperature' T decreasing
   exponentially in annealing-time k, T = T_0 exp(-c k^1/D). The
   introduction of re-annealing also permits adaptation to changing
   sensitivities in the multi-dimensional parameter-space. This annealing
   schedule is faster than fast Cauchy annealing, where T = T_0/k, and
   much faster than Boltzmann annealing, where T = T_0/ln k.

Summary:      Portable AI Lab

Version:      2.4.3 (8-NOV-93); 2.4.2 (30-JUL-93); Mac (2-FEB-94)

Description: 

   PAIL (Portable AI Lab) is a computing environment containing a
   collection of state-of-the-art AI tools, examples, and documentation.
   It is aimed at those involved in AI courses (teaching or learning) at
   university level or equivalent. The system has enough built-in
   functionality to enable its users to get practical experience with a
   broad range of AI problems without having to build all the supporting
   tools from scratch. It is implemented in Common Lisp and uses CLOS and
   Allegro Common Windows (i.e., in Allegro CL 4.1).

   PAIL is designed around a set of modules, each of which includes a
   fully implemented and documented computational kernel together with a
   representative set of autonomous demonstrations and running examples.
   The modules also provide appropriate graphic visualizations for the
   presentation of key algorithms and concepts.  In addition, sufficient
   documentation is provided to enable the user to retrieve key
   literature references, understand the architecture and specifics of
   the implementation, and modify the implementation if desired.

   PAIL's current modules cover the following topics
      - Automated Theorem Proving
      - Natural Language Processing
      - Rule-Based Inference
      - Truth Maintenance Systems
      - Constraint Satisfaction Problems
      - Learning

   and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an
   expert system. The system uses two basic inexact concepts, fuzziness
   and uncertainty. 

   Please read the terms for use in the FuzzyCLIPS documentation
   before using.  

   FuzzyCLIPS was developed at the Institute for Information Technology
   (Knowledge Systems Lab) of the National Research Council of Canada.

Package:      areas/expert/systems/expert/

Name:         Expert

Summary:      An expert system written in ADA.

Version:      1.0 (3-DEC-85)

Description: 

   EXPERT is a backward chaining (goal driven) expert system.  It is
   based on two articles. The first (Duda and Gaschnig, September 1981
   BYTE) published the expert system in BASIC skirting the use of
   recursion, and the second (Darrell Morgeson, Jan/Feb 85 issue of
   JOURNAL OF PASCAL, ADA, & MODULA-2) published in Modula-2 with
   recursion implemented.  The listing had one logic error which caused
   pointer explosion on the last hypothesis in the GETRULE routine.  This
   implementation follows the MODULA-2 design completely and was not
   designed from the ground up in Ada.  Many improvements would be
   possible if more time permitted my working on this.

Package:      areas/expert/systems/mike/

Name:         MIKE

Summary:      Free and portable expert system teaching system.

Version:      2.03 (1-APR-91), 2.50

Description: 

   MIKE (Micro Interpreter for Knowledge Engineering) is a full-featured,
   free, and portable software environment designed for teaching purposes
   at the UK's Open University.  It includes forward and backward
   chaining rules with user-definable conflict resolution strategies, and
   a frame representation language with inheritance and 'demons' (code
   triggered by frame access or change), plus user-settable inheritance
   strategies.  Automatic 'how' explanations (proof histories) are
   provided for rule execution, as are user-specified 'why' explanations.
   Coarse-grained and fine-grained rule tracing facilities are provided,
   along with a novel 'rule graph' display which concisely shows the
   history of rule execution.  MIKE, which forms the kernel of an Open
   University course on Knowledge Engineering, is written in a
   conservative and portable subset of Edinburgh-syntax Prolog, and is
   distributed as non-copy-protected source code. 

   MIKE version 1 was described in the October/November 1990 issue of
   BYTE. MIKE v1.50, which was formerly available from a range of ftp
   servers, has been superseded by two newer versions: MIKEv2.03, a full
   Prolog source code version, incorporating a RETE algorithm for fast
   forward chaining, a truth maintenance system, uncertainty handling,
   and hypothetical worlds, and MIKEv2.50, a turnkey DOS version with
   menu-driven interface and frame- and rule-browsing tools, fully
   compatible with MIKEv2.03, but without source code.

Package:      areas/expert/systems/ops5/

Name:         OPS5

Summary:      RETE-based expert system shell.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains the original public domain implementation
   of an OPS5 interpreter written by Charles L. Forgy and ported to
   Common Lisp by George Wood and Jim Kowalski. Also included is an
   updated version with several bug fixes and ports by Mark Kantrowitz.

   Charles Forgy, the inventor of Rete and OPS5, has a company that sells RAL
   (Rule-extended Algorithmic Language), a high-performance C-based
   expert systems tool. RAL uses a more efficient match algorithm called
   Rete II and was designed to permit seamless integration of rules and
   objects into C programs.  RAL is a superset of C.  RAL rules can
   operate directly on the data types used by the C code in your
   application.  RAL "understands" C type declarations, function
   prototypes, #define constants, and so on.  C expressions, statements,
   macros, function calls, and so on can be embedded directly in the
   rules.  RAL has an open architecture that permits it to be used with
   any GUI builder, data base library, or other library that can be used
   with C.  No bridges are required.  For efficiency, RAL rules are
   compiled into C code. A special version of the language, called
   RAL/RT, adds the features that are required for real-time expert
   systems.  RAL and RAL/RT have a multi-windowed, point-and-click
   development environment called the RAL Workbench.  RAL and RAL/RT are
   available for DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, and UNIX.  License fees for
   development systems are available on request. There are no run-time
   fees charged for distributing applications developed using RAL.  For
   information about RAL, write Production Systems Technologies, Inc.,
   5001 Baum Blvd., Pittsburgh, PA 15213, call 412-683-4000, or 
   fax 412-683-6347.

Package:      areas/expert/systems/salvini/

Name:         PROTEST

Summary:      Prolog Expert System Building Tool

Version:      1-FEB-89

Description: 

   This is a cut-down version of the expert system building tool produced
   by Steven Salvini as part of his M.Sc. dissertation in 1986. 

   PROTEST is a tool for building prototype expert systems.  It accepts a
   knowledge base written in IF-THEN rules whose conditions and conclusions
   consist of object/attribute/value triples:

       rule1:
           if
                   pain/duration/constant
               and
                   pain/localisation/accurate
               and
                   pain/'initiated by'/'gentle touch'
               and
                   pain/character/'sudden onset'
               and
                   pain/character/'intense & throbbing'
               and
                   gingivae/swelling/present
               and
                   gingivae/erythema/present
               and
                   miscellaneous/'local lymphadenopathy'/present
               and
                   pain/'initiated by'/'clenching, biting or chewing'
               and
                   tooth/mobility/present
           then
               diagnosis/group/abscess
           with
               certainty(0.9).

   Conclusions may contain certainty factors.

   Inference can be either backward chaining or mixed. The former is
   normal backward chaining, giving a single firm conclusion if one has
   been deduced or else as a list of possible conclusions in order of
   their certainties.

   Mixed mode is a "mixed" inference strategy which first prompts you to
   enter your initial findings and then tries to deduce one or more of
   the goals. If a firm conclusion is not reached, it then tries to solve
   the problem by backward-chaining.

   After PROTEST has given a conclusion, you can ask to see its chain of
   reasoning.

   A sample knowledge base, for dental diagnosis, is included.

Package:      areas/fuzzy/doc/elkan/

Name:         

Summary:      Information about and responses to the Elkan controversy.

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a revised version of Elkan's AAAI-93 paper,
   "The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic", and two responses to the
   paper from members of the fuzzy logic community. One response is by
   Enrique Ruspini and the other by Didier Dubois and Henri Prade.

   The following summary of the controversy comes from the Fuzzy Logic FAQ.

      The presentation of Elkan's AAAI-93 paper 
         Charles Elkan, "The Paradoxical Success of Fuzzy Logic", in
         Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial
         Intelligence, 698-703, 1993.
      has generated much controversy. The fuzzy logic community claims that
      the paper is based on some common misunderstandings about fuzzy logic, 
      but Elkan still maintains the correctness of his proof. (See, for
      instance, AI Magazine 15(1):6-8, Spring 1994.) 

      Elkan proves that for a particular set of axiomatizations of fuzzy
      logic, fuzzy logic collapses to two-valued logic. The proof is correct
      in the sense that the conclusion follows from the premises. The
      disagreement concerns the relevance of the premises to fuzzy logic.
      At issue are the logical equivalence axioms. Elkan has shown that if
      you include any of several plausible equivalences, such as
         not(A and not B) == (not A and not B) or B
      with the min, max, and 1- axioms of fuzzy logic, then fuzzy logic
      reduces to binary logic. The fuzzy logic community states that these
      logical equivalence axioms are not required in fuzzy logic, and that
      Elkan's proof requires the excluded middle law, a law that is commonly
      rejected in fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic researchers must simply take care
      to avoid using any of these equivalences in their work.

      It is difficult to do justice to the issues in so short a summary.  Do
      not assume that this summary is the last word on this topic, but
      instead read Elkan's paper and some of the other correspondence on
      this topic (some of which has appeared in the comp.ai.fuzzy
      newsgroup).

      A final version of Elkan's paper, together with responses from members
      of the fuzzy logic community, will appear in an issue of IEEE Expert
      sometime in 1994. A paper by Dubois and Prade will be presented at
      AAAI-94.

Name:         XFUZZY

Summary:      A Simulation Environment for Fuzzy Logic Control Systems

Version:      1.1 (23-MAR-94)

Description: 

   xfuzzy is an X-Windows based simulation tool for fuzzy controllers
   that runs on Sun workstations.

   The kernel of xfuzzy consists of the software implementation of a
   fuzzy inference engine. The modules defining the behavior of the
   controller (Fuzzifier, Rules Set, and Defuzzifier) and the system
   being controlled (model) interact with this inference engine. The
   environment is completed with a user interface which, through a group
   of menus, eases the tasks of editing the membership functions, rules,
   and the system model, as well as the graphic presentation of the
   simulation results.

   The closing of the feedback loop of the complete system (controller +
   system under control) is accomplished by means of a program in C,
   provided by the user according to the directions contained in a
   template file supplied by the environment. This module is dynamically
   linked to the inference engine, allowing the user to perform the whole
   tuning of the controller without exiting the environment.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/em/

Name:         EM

Summary:      Evolution Machine

Version:      2.2 (23-AUG-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains the Evolution Machine (EM). EM presents a
   collection of evolutionary algorithms (Genetic Algorithms and
   Evolution Strategies) in a common framework.  EM is universally
   applicable to continuous real-coded optimization problems. In the EM,
   the authors have coded fundamental evolutionary algorithms, and added
   some of their approaches to evolutionary search.

   The EM includes extensive menu techniques with:

      * Default parameter setting for inexperienced users.

      * Well-defined entries for  EM- control by freaks of
        the EM,  who want  to leave  the standard  process
        control.

      * Data processing for repeated runs (with or without
        change of the strategy parameters).

      * Graphical presentation of results:
        online presentation of the evolution progress, one-,
        two- and three-dimensional graphic output to analyze
        the fitness function and the evolution process.

      * Integration of calling MS--DOS utilities (Turbo C).

   EM runs on PC's with MS-DOS.

   user-interface improvements.  Major additions include a wrapper that
   simplifies the writing of evaluation functions, a facility to
   distribute experiments over networks of machines, and Dynamic
   Parameter Encoding, a technique that improves GA performance in
   continuous search spaces by adaptively refining the representation of
   real-valued genes.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/gac/

Name:         GAC

Summary:      Simple GA in C

Version:      9106.12

Description: 

   This directory contains GAC, a simple GA (conceptually based on
   Grefenstette's Genesis) written in C.

   Baker's SUS selection algorithm is employed, n-point crossover is
   maintained at 60%, and mutation is very low. Selection is based on
   proportional fitness. This GA uses generations.  It is also important
   to note that this GA maximizes.

   A note on crossover is in order. This version of GAC allows for
   n-point crossover, where n is less than the length of an individual
   (although there is no check for that). It is also possible to run
   uniform crossover (see discussion below).

   GAC will display run-time information as it executes.  GAC also has
   the ability to output this information into files. These statistics
   include best behavior, online/ offline measurements, convergence, and
   the number of reevaluations per generation. At this time the code is
   commented out. The user can simply remove a few comment symbols to use
   this facility. See run.c and geval.c for details.

   There is no ranking, adaptive operators, etc. We intend to explore
   these issues in future work.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/gacc/

Name:         GACC

Summary:      Genetic Aided Cascade-Correlation

Version:      15-MAR-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Genetic Aided Cascade-Correlation (GACC).

   Genetic algorithms are applied to the optimization of the weights in
   the cascade-correlation learning architecture.  In this architecture,
   the neural network starts out with a layer of output neurons.  The
   output neuron weights are then adjusted to minimize the error in the
   network.  A hidden neuron is then added and its weights adjusted so
   its output correlates with the error in the network. It is then
   connected to the output neurons and the weights of the output neuron
   are once again readjusted.  This process of adding neurons continues
   until a network with an acceptable error is produced.

   Genetic algorithms are used to find the weights for both the hidden
   and output neurons.  We attempt to use the global optimization
   characteristics of genetic algorithms to find the global set of
   weights.  However, while simple genetic algorithms can find the area
   of the weight space where there is a minimum error for the output
   weights or maximum correlation for the hidden layers, they do not
   converge to the actual minimum or maximum.  We must find a way to
   supplement the simple genetic algorithm.

   In our approach, the Genetic aided cascade-correlation, we explore the
   weight space first by using simple genetic algorithms with
   non-overlapping populations and binary encoded weights.  We then use
   Quickprop to converge to the minimum or maximum.  We have applied our
   algorithm to the two spiral test with resulting average network sizes
   of an average of 21.6 hidden nodes.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/gags/

Name:         GAGS

Summary:      Genetic algorithm application generator and C++ class library

Version:      0.91 (27-JUN-94)

Description: 

   GAGS 0.9 (Genetic Algorithms from Granada, Spain) is a system designed
   to make it simpler to design a genetic algorithm. It consists of a C++
   class library for programming genetic algorithms. But from a user
   point of view, it is a genetic algorithm application generator. The
   application generator takes a fitness function written in C and
   surrounds with enough code to produce a complete program. It then
   compiles it and runs it for you.

   GAGS includes the following features:

      -  Selection procedures include steady-state, tournament, and
         roulette-wheel. 

      -  Crossover is 2-point. Uniform crossover is also supported in
         the library, but the apps generator does not know about it.

      -  Mutation is bit-flip, with user-supplied frequency. Other
         operators, like gene duplication or elimination, and gene
         transposition, are also included in the library, but not in
         the apps generator. 

      -  Best fitness and individual are printed on STDOUT or to a file.

      -  Most GA parameters are inside a configuration file, so that 
         different operators and frequencies can be tested on a
         fitness function. Only the fitness function and the output
         options are fixed, once the program has been generated and
         compiled. 

      -  Fitness evaluation using training files.

      -  Graphics output through gnuplot.

   The application generator gags.pl is written in perl, so this language
   must also be installed before using GAGS.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/genesis/

Name:         GENESIS

Summary:      GENEtic Search Implementation System

Version:      5.0 (October 1990)

Description: 

   This directory contains GENEtic Search Implementation System
   (GENESIS).  GENESIS is system for function optimization based on
   genetic search techniques. Since genetic algorithms are task
   independent optimizers, the user must provide only an "evaluation"
   function which returns a value when given a particular point in the
   search space.

   This version offers several enhancements over previous versions that
   should make the system much more user friendly.  The major improvement
   is a user-level representation that allows the user to think about the
   genetic structures as vectors of real numbers, rather than bit strings.
   This level of representation should make the application of GENESIS to
   new problems easier than ever.  A number of new options have been added,
   including: a display mode that includes an interactive user interface,
   the option to maximize or minimize the objective function, the choice of
   rank-based or proportional selection algorithm, and an option to use a
   Gray code as a transparent lower level representation.

   The purpose of making this system available is to encourage the
   experimental use of genetic algorithms on realistic optimization
   problems, and thereby to identify the strengths and weaknesses of
   genetic algorithms.

Description: 

   This directory contains GENEsYs, a genetic algorithms implementation
   based on Grefenstette's GENESIS.  It includes extensions and new
   features for experimental purposes, such as different selection
   mechanisms (linear ranking, Boltzmann selection, mu-selection,
   lambda-selection), general extinctive selection variants, and extended
   recombination operators (m-point, uniform, discrete and intermediate
   recombination).  Self-adaptation of mutation rates is also possible.

   A set of objective functions is provided, including De Jong's functions,
   complicated continuous functions, a TSP-problem, binary functions, and a
   fractal function.  There are also additional data-monitoring facilities
   such as recording average, variance and skew of object variables and 
   mutation rates, or creating bitmap-dumps of the population.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/genet/

Name:         GenET

Summary:      Domain-independent generic GA software package

Version:      1.00 (20-SEP-93)

Description: 

   GenET is a domain-independent GA package. All problem independent
   mechanisms have been implemented and can be used regardless of
   application domain.  It allows the fast development of applications.
   GenET is intended to become a depository of representations and
   operators and to be used as a tool for comparing different models and
   strategies.

   The algorithm provides many models and choices.  For example,
   population models include generational GA, steady-state, (n,m)-EP and
   (n,n+m)-EP models.  Choices include automatic adaptation of operator
   probabilities and a dynamic ranking mechanism.

   The two included examples illustrate how to implement problems with
   heterogeneous and homogeneous structures (with explicit rep/opers) and
   how to use the existing library (FP).

   PARAGENESIS doesn't modify the genetic algorithm to be more
   parallelizable as these modifications can drastically alter the
   behavior of the algorithm.  Instead each member is placed on a
   separate processor allowing initialization, evaluation and mutation to
   be completely parallel.  The costs of global control and communication
   in selection and crossover are present but minimized as much as
   possible.  In general PARAGENESIS on an 8k CM-200 seems to run 10-100
   times faster than GENESIS on a Sparc 2 and finds equivalent solutions.
   The solutions are not identical only because the parallel random
   number generator gives a different stream of numbers.

   PARAGENESIS includes all the features of serial GENESIS plus some
   additions.  The additions include the ability to collect timing
   statistics, probabilistic selection(as opposed to Baker's stochastic
   universal sampling), uniform crossover and local or neighborhood
   selection.  Anyone familiar with the serial implementation of GENESIS
   and C* should have little problem using PARAGENESIS.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/paratsp/

Name:         ParaTSP

Summary:      Parallel GA with Simulated Annealing to solve TSP's

Version:      1.0 (6-JUN-94)

Description: 

   ParaTSP is a software package for solving Traveling Salesman Problems
   (TSP) using genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA).
   ParaTSP is based on Baeck's GeneSyS.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/pga/

Name:         PGA         

Summary:      Parallel Genetic Algorithms Testbed

Version:      2.5 (4-OCT-93)

Description: 

   PGA is a simple testbed for basic explorations in genetic algorithms.
   Command line arguments control a range of parameters, there are a
   number of built-in problems for the GA to solve. The current set
   consists of:

     - maximize the number of bits set in a chromosome

     - De Jong's functions DJ1, DJ2, DJ3, DJ5

     - binary F6, used by Schaffer et al

     - a crude 1-d knapsack problem; you specify a target and a set of
       numbers in an external file, GA tries to find a subset that sums
       as closely as possible to the target

     - the `royal road' function(s); a chromosome is regarded as
       a set of consecutive blocks of size K, and scores K for each
       block entirely filled with 1s

   and it's easy to add your own problems (see below). Chromosomes are
   represented as character arrays, so you are not (quite) stuck with
   bit-string problem encodings.

   PGA allows multiple populations, with periodic migration between
   them, and a range of other options. For example, you can choose
   the chromosome length independently of the choice of problem.

Package:      areas/genetic/ga/systems/scs/

Name:         SCS 

Summary:      C port of Goldberg's Simple Classifier System

Version:      19-AUG-93

Description: 

   SCS (Simple Classifier System) is a C port of the system from
   Appendix D of Goldberg's "Genetic Algorithms in Search,
   Optimization, and Machine Learning".

   The following is a short description on the operation of the simple
   classifier system:

      The classifier system randomly generates a starting population
      of classifiers.  The program then generates a random signal to
      the environment (in this case the multiplexer).  The multiplexer
      responds with the environmental message.  The program then attempts
      to match the random signal with the classifiers and those that match
      are allowed to bid.  The strengths of the matching classifiers are
      deducted by the amount that is to be bid specified by the CBID variable
      and the effective bids of the classifiers are compared.  The classifer
      with the largest effective bid (the bid modified by EBID) wins and the
      classifier message is compared with the environmental message.  If the
      messages match, the classifier is given a reward.  If the bucket brigade
      flag is activated, the classifier will post a reward to be given to
      the last matching classifier.  The genetic algorithm is activated at
      the iteration specified by the variable GAPERIOD.  Pairs of
      classifiers are chosen randomly according to their strengths.  Bad
      performing classifiers are replaced according to their similarities
      to the new offsprings.  Data about the population and its parameters
      is recorded in REPORT.OUT at periodic intervals.

Package:      areas/kr/systems/colab/

Name:         COLAB

Summary:      Knowledge Representation and Compilation Laboratory

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains the COmpilation LABoratory (COLAB). 

   COLAB is a hybrid knowledge representation system emphasizing the
   horizontal and vertical compilation of knowledge bases. It has been
   designed as a COmpilation LABoratory aiming at a synergetic
   collaboration of different knowledge representation and reasoning
   formalisms.  It is comprised of subsystems dealing with different
   kinds of knowledge and that can also be used as stand-alone systems.
   The COLAB representation architecture splits into two main parts, an
   affirmative part, sometimes also called `assertional', and a taxonomic
   part.

   The affirmative part provides efficient reasoning with different kinds
   of relational or functional knowledge using tailored inference
   engines.  For affirmative knowledge represented as constraint nets
   COLAB supplies constraint propagation techniques (CONTAX). Relational
   knowledge in the form of Horn rules is processed by forward (FORWARD)
   and backward (RELFUN) chaining.  The backward component is also suited
   for expressing (non-deterministic) functional dependencies.  Taxonomic
   knowledge is represented by intensional concept definitions which are
   automatically arranged in a subsumption hierarchy (TAXON).  Dynamic
   cooperation of the subsystems is organized through access primitives
   providing an interface to the respective reasoning services.

   COLAB is a piece of research software developed at DFKI and the
   University of Kaiserslautern.

   COLAB involves 4 subsystems:

    +  RELFUN is a logic-programming language with call-by-value
       (eager), non-deterministic, non-ground functions, and
       higher-order operations [Boley92b].

       SHORT DESCRIPTION: Operational (interpreter in pure LISP), procedural
       (SLV-resolution), fixpoint, and model-theoretic semantics [Boley92c].
       Interpreter for full RELFUN; WAM emulator for fixed-arity subset.
       Layered compiler system, from source-to-source transformers to
       declarative classifier, to WAM-code generator [Boley90a].  Translator
       to relational subset of RELFUN, henceforth to PROLOG.  Accepting
       freely interchangeable LISP-style and PROLOG-style syntaxes.  Tracer
       for valued conjunctions; interface to LISP; on-line help.  Prelude
       with useful relations/functions; library of declarative hypergraph
       operations [Boley92a]; components for mechanical-engineering system
       using declarative geometry [BoleyHanschke+91b]. Tight (WAM-level)
       coupling with FORWARD.

    +  TAXON is a terminological knowledge representation system extended by
       concrete domains [BaaderHanschke91b,Hanschke92b].

       SHORT DESCRIPTION: Comprises a T-box and an A-box formalism for
       representing terminological and assertional knowledge.  The T-box
       provides expressive concept forming operators, in particular for
       specifying role/attribute interaction. The TAXON A-box can
       instantiate concepts, roles, etc. All reasoning services (e.g.,
       classification, realization) are implemented by terminating, sound
       and complete algorithms. A concrete domain of rational numbers with
       comparison operators is tightly coupled with the abstract
       terminological formalism.  Can compute the domain hierarchy for
       CONTAX.

    +  CONTAX is a constraint system for weighted constraints over
       hierarchically structured finite domains.

       SHORT DESCRIPTION: The CONTAX system supports primitive
       (extensional), compound (conjunctive), disjunctive and predicative
       constraints.  Constraint instances are connected by variables that
       range over specific domains which can be plain or hierarchically
       structured.  Hierarchical domains can be defined in CONTAX itself or
       by using the classifier of TAXON. Intervals regarded as subdomains of
       integers are also supported. All constraints are given a weight (from
       a discrete set ranging from 'hard' to 'soft') that is used by CONTAX
       for relaxation of overspecified problems.  Besides being integrated
       in COLAB, there also exists a stand-alone version of CONTAX with a
       programmer interface to LISP [MeyerSteinle92] that enables any
       LISP-based application to use CONTAX as its own constraint-reasoning
       formalism. The CONTAX system has already been used to formalize the
       tool selection problem in a CIM application [Meyer92a,Meyer92b].

    +  FORWARD is a logic programming language with bottom-up and top-down
       evaluation of Horn clauses [HarmHinkelmann+92].

       SHORT DESCRIPTION: User-specifiable division of Horn clauses for
       bottom-up, top-down and bidirectional reasoning.  Semi-naive
       bottom-up evaluation with top-down provable premises.  Generalized
       Magic-Set transformation for goal-directed bottom-up reasoning,
       supporting conjunctive queries and considering top-down premises. An
       interpreter version is available, there is also an abstract machine,
       which will be available in the near future.  Simulation of forward
       chaining in a backward chaining system by rule transformation.
       Compilation into a WAM with special forward code area and additional
       so-called retain stack for derived facts.  Upside-down
       meta-interpreter in RELFUN for forward chaining, partial evaluation
       of the meta-interpreter.  Tight coupling with the RELFUN system on
       interpreter-level and WAM-level. A tight integration of the
       semi-naive strategy with the TAXON system is currently under
       development.

   Other subsystems used in COLAB include 
     -  GAMA (General Abstract Machine Assembler)
     -  NyWAM (WAM emulator in Common Lisp)

Name:         FrameWork

Summary:      Generic Frame System

Version:      2.1 (18-MAR-93)

Description: 

   FrameWork is a Common Lisp portable frame-based knowledge
   representation language. It combines some of the better features of a
   variety of other frame languages. It includes a variety of tools for
   building, examining, and using knowledge-based systems.  It is
   intended primarily to be a solid example of how such a system could be
   built. FrameWork is easily extended.

   Features include generic demons (active values) & procedural
   attachment, object-oriented programming with attribute and behavior
   inheritance in an associative network (methods and message passing),
   cached values, default values, listener, object database maintenance
   utilities.

Package:      areas/kr/systems/frames/frobs/

Name:         FROBS

Summary:      Object-oriented frame language for Common Lisp

Version:      1.2 (2-AUG-88)

Description: 

   FROBS is a merger between frames and objects.  It is implemented in
   Common Lisp and provides an object-oriented language as well as frame
   type operations and a forward chaining rule system.  The rule system
   translates rule definitions into functions which can then be compiled
   by the native Common Lisp compiler.

   The frobs-doc.l file is something that someone else did to add
   documentation strings to FROBS.  It is not something that we load
   automatically, so is separate.  Having it be a separate file is fine.
   It is not a document describing FROBS or FROLIC, which are in the tar
   files as frobs.ps and prolog.ps.

Package:      areas/kr/systems/frames/parmenid/

Name:         Parmenides

Summary:      Frame-based knowledge representation system.

Version:      1.5 (22-APR-91)

Description: 

   PARMENIDES (PropagAting, Rulekit-Motivated ENgine for Instance
   DEScriptions) is a frame-based knowledge representation system.  It is
   influenced by SRL, Framekit, CommonLoops, and the Spice lisp structure
   implementation.  The slot and facet access functions have comparable
   speed to the Slisp slot access functions.  It has some of the Framekit
   and SRL functionality, such as facets, demons, and user-defined
   relations.  However, like Loops, it makes a distinction between
   classes and instances.  This means that instances can only be an
   instance of one class, while classes may be subclasses of (have an
   is-a relation with) more than one class.  Instances may not have any
   slots that their classes don't have.  Classes describe a way to make
   instances, and instances only participate in the frame network through
   their classes.  Parmenides is implemented in Common Lisp.  Other
   features of Parmenides include multiple language messages and
   user-defined relations.

   Parmenides is used by FRulekit, a CommonLisp frame-based RETE
   production system.

Package:      areas/kr/systems/kl_one/motel/

Name:         MOTEL

Summary:      Modal KL-ONE

Version:      10-AUG-93

Description: 

   MOTEL is a logic-based knowledge representation language of the KL-ONE
   family.  It contains as a kernel the ALC language which is a decidable
   sublanguage of first-order predicate logic.

   Whereas ALC is a single-agent knowledge representation language, i.e.
   ALC is only able to represent general world knowledge or the knowledge
   of one agent about the world, MOTEL is a multi-agent knowledge
   representation system. The MOTEL language allows modal contexts and
   modal concept forming operators which allow to represent and reason
   about the believes and wishes of multiple agents. Furthermore it is
   possible to represent defaults and stereotypes.

   Beside the basic reasoning facilities for consistency checking,
   classification, and realization, MOTEL provides an abductive inference
   mechanism.  Furthermore it is able to give explanations for its
   inferences.

   a planning and knowledge tool. 

   This is a Knowledge Representation system based on concepts proved
   with HORNE, and follow James Allen's grand design for KR following his
   publications (in particular, see his book with Pelavin and Kautz).  It
   includes 2 major modes for representing knowledge (as Horn Clauses or
   as frames), which are interchangable; a type subsystem for typed and
   type restricted objects (including variables); E-unification;
   negation; forward and backward chaining; complete proofs (prove,
   disprove, find the KB inconsistent, or claim a goal is neither
   provable nor disprovable); contextual reasoning; truth maintenance;
   intelligent backtracking; full LISP compatibility (can call or be
   called by lisp); upward compatible with HORNE; Allen & Koomen's TEMPOS
   time interval reasoning subsystem; frames have KL-1 type features,
   plus arbitrary predicate restrictions on slots within a frame as well
   as default values for slots; separate subsystem providing
   user-interface facilities and ZMACS interface on the lispms.

   RHET is currently being rewritten into a new system called Shocker.

Description: 

   TIMELOGIC and TEMPOS add James Allen's interval logic to Rhet.

   The TimeLogic system is an interval-based forward chaining inference
   engine and database manager of temporal constraints.  Relational
   constraints, indicating relative order between intervals, are based on
   Allen's interval logic.  The TimeLogic system also supports durational
   constraints, indicating relative magnitude between intervals, and
   reference links, used for the explicit or automatic construction of
   interval hierarchies.  Constraints are posed and propagated in
   user-defined contexts with inheritance. Supports relative metric
   constraints but no absolute dates or times.

   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.

Package:      areas/learning/systems/focl/

Name:         FOCL

Summary:      Expert System Shell and Machine Learning Program

Version:      2.1 (21-APR-94)

Description: 

   FOCL is an expert system shell and machine learning program written in
   Common Lisp. The machine learning program extends Quinlan's FOIL
   program by containing a compatible explanation-based learning
   component.  FOCL learns Horn Clause programs from examples and
   (optionally) background knowledge. The expert system includes a
   backward-chaining rule interpreter and a graphical interface to the
   rule and fact base. 

   The Macintosh version includes a graphical interface that displays the
   search space explored by FOCL, so it is a useful pedagogical tool.
   This application also contains a graphical interface for building rule
   bases, so you can ignore the machine learning aspects, and use it as
   an expert system shell with the following capabilities:

      +  A backward-chaining rule interpreter.

      +  A graphical rule and fact editor.

      +  Graphical display of the rule base.

      +  (Simple) Natural language explanation of inferences

      +  Menu-based facilities for editing rules and adding natural language
         translations to rules.

      +  Optional typing of variables and checking the rule base for type
         conflicts 

      +  Tracing of rules

      +  Analysis of the accuracy of rules in a rule base.

   Sample rule bases are included.

   The Common Lisp source code is limited to portable source code for
   the machine learning program only, since the interface depends on
   the Macintosh.

Summary:      Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog

Version:      9-FEB-94

Description:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 

   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe (see address
   below).  Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated 3.5 inch floppy
   (double, high and extra-high density), which should be included with
   your request. You can also get them by sending an email message to
   Thomas Hoppe.

   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems
   to Thomas Hoppe. Send suggestions and complaints about the ftp
   library to Werner Emde.  

   The directory ftp.gmd.de:/MachineLearning/ contains additional
   machine learning publications, data, and software, primarily related
   to the European ESPRIT projects Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT) and
   Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the European Network of Excellence
   in Machine Learning (MLnet) and the Inductive Logic Programming
   Pan-European Scientific Network (ILPnet). It includes the source code
   of Stephen Muggleton's and Cao Feng's GOLEM learning system (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/software/golem) and a BibTeX file with
   around 325 entries of articles related to ILP (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/bib). For more information, send mail to

Package:      areas/learning/systems/mobal/

Name:         MOBAL

Summary:      Knowledge Acquisition and Machine Learning System

Version:      3.0b

Description: 

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  
   MOBAL includes a graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   Since the very first releases, MOBAL has been a kind of toolbox
   offering different tools (including the Rule Discovery Tool RDT) to
   support the modeling of domains.  Now we have coupled MOBAL with some
   other well known ILP systems. The new release contains interfaces to
   and the code of following learning systems:

      - FOIL 5 (J. Ross Quinlan),
      - GOLEM  (S. Muggleton and C. Feng),
      - mFOIL  (S. Dzeroski and I. Bratko),

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains a copy of the Common Lisp code
   corresponding to the assignments for the graduate course in machine
   learning taught by Dr. Mooney.

   The programs include:

     1. AQ algorithms for learning from examples. Uses either beam
        search with bounded stars or the version space algorithm to
        compute stars.

    2. BACKPROP.

    3. COBWEB.  Incremental conceptual clustering algorithm (with
       soybean data). 

    4. DEDUCE. Prolog-like theorem prover or deductive retrieval
       system. Uses generators to retrieve one answer at a time and
       also generates proofs. Supports only backward chaining, with
       optional depth bound on the number of rules.

    5. EGGS. Explanation-Based Generalizer. EGGS can generalize the
       proofs returned by DEDUCE and generate macro-rules from the
       general proofs. These macro-rules are stored and preferentially
       used in future deductions to increase performance.

   6. EXPLORER. In the spirit of AM, but more limited. Explores a
      space of concepts, guided by "interestingness" measures and
      makes conjectures about the concepts it explores. 

   7. ID3 algorithm for learning from examples. Produces decision trees
      discriminating positive and negative instances.

   8. PERCEPTRON.  Simple system for learning from examples
      using the perceptron learning procedure to adjust a set of
      weights on a single linear threshold unit until all of the

Package:      areas/learning/systems/utexas/neither/

Name:         NEITHER

Summary:      NEITHER Theory Refinement System

Version:      

Description: 

   NEITHER, which stands for "New EITHER", is an extension of the EITHER
   theory refinement system. Theory refinement systems are used to modify
   a set of rules which are incomplete or incorrect. Given a set of
   examples, the rules are refined until the rule base is consistent with
   the examples. One example of the use of theory refinement is the
   knowledge acquisition phase of expert system construction.
   Specifically, it may be relatively simple to develop a set of rules to
   cover most of a problem but difficult to generate a complete solution.
   Often, additional examples can be generated easily and given with the
   partially correct theory to a system like NEITHER. The result is an
   improved set of rules.

Package:      areas/neural/systems/animator/

Name:         HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR

Summary:      Graphical display of backpropagation training data and weights

Version:      1.01 (10-OCT-93)

Description: 

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.

Package:      areas/neural/systems/neuronc/

Name:         NeuronC

Summary:      Biophysically-Based Compartmental Simulator 

Version:      7-JUL-94

Description: 

   Neuronc is a general-purpose computer language somewhat
   like C that has special features for simulating large neural 
   circuits using compartments.  It allows creating large arrays and
   uses an iterative difference equation solver so that virtually
   any network geometry may be specified (e.g. geometry is not
   limited to "tree" structure, and may include loops).

   Since NeuronC is primarily a language it does not contain a
   complete interactive pull-down menu system for describing and
   running a simulation.  However, there is a complete graphics
   facility for displaying on standard devices such as X11,
   PostScript, and VGA.  NeuronC also produces ray-traced 
   scenes for rendering with the POVRAY simulator.

   The "NeuronC" simulator was originally designed for vision
   experiments on large neural circuits. It includes a 2D light stimulus
   (with optical blur and photon noise) and photoreceptor models complete
   with spectral sensitivities and time-responses.  A flexible set of
   synapse and membrane channel models is also included, including HH,
   sequential-state, and calcium-dependent versions.  Any network
   geometry can be simulated (including electrical loops) and a virtually
   unlimited number of voltage- clamp/current clamp and recording sites
   may be specified and plotted.

   gradient descent (per-epoch or per-pattern), generalization & stopped
   training, c index, and interface enhancements.

   Questions and comments regarding the Quickprop algorithm itself should
   be directed to Scott Fahlman at sef+@cs.cmu.edu. Issues pertaining
   to NevProp code or functionality itself should be directed to the authors.

Name:         NN-Simulator

Summary:      Flexible and User-Friendly Neural Network Simulator

Version:      26-JUN-93

Description: 

   The simulate program is a user-friendly and flexible neural network
   simulator.  It is designed to handle the simulation of associative
   learning style networks, such as the LMS (aka Rescorla-Wagner)
   learning procedure and Backpropagation.  Multiple interacting networks
   can be simulated in parallel, with their behavior and interactions
   specified by a simple command language.

   Some of the more useful features of the simulator include:

      -  Simulation weights can be saved, and later used to initialize the 
         weights of a new simulation.

      -  Multilayer networks with arbitrary interconnectivity can be
         created. 

      -  Quickprop, a faster version of backpropagation is supported.

      -  Network behavior on each cycle in the simulation can be
         specified. 

      -  The output of the simulation on each cycle can be specified.

   The example network files include:

      -  ENCODER. Simulation files for a 10-5-10 encoder (described in
         (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986 v.1).  Demonstrates a simple
         backpropagation network.

      -  HINTON. Simulation files for Hinton's "family tree problem"

         example of backpropagation: the network is six layers instead of 3.
         Includes both backprop and quickprop versions of the network.

      -  SHANKS. Simulation files for some simple linear associative
         networks (discussed in Shanks, 1991).

   Parallel and Distributed High Performance Systems (IPVR) at the
   University of Stuttgart. The SNNS simulator contains a simulator kernel
   written in ANSI C and a 2D/3D graphical user interface running under
   X11R4/X11R5. 

   SNNS includes the following learning procedures: backpropagation
   (online, batch, with momentum and flat spot elimin., time delay),
   counterpropagation, quickprop, backpercolation 1, and generalized
   radial basis functions (RBF), RProp, recurrent ART-1, ART-2 and ARTMAP,
   Cascade Correlation and Recurrent Cascade Correlation, Dynamic LVQ,
   and Time delay networks (TDNN). (Elman networks and some other network
   paradigms have already been implemented but are scheduled for a later
   release.)

   NESSUS is a language for the description of neural networks. The
   Nessus compiler creates a network description that can be read by SNNS.

   SNNS2C is a tool to convert the description of a neural network
   from SNNS format to C source code. This code can then be linked to an
   existing program as a subroutine.

   SNNS is among the most popular neural network simulators.

Name:         ToolDiag

Summary:      Feature selection software for improving classifiers.

Version:      1.4.1 (3-DEC-93)

Description: 

   ToolDiag is a feature selection program that increases the accuracy of
   classifiers and reduces their complexity by providing them with a
   subset containing only the most relevant features. It has interfaces
   to LVQ_PAK and SNNS, and uses a data file format that is compatible
   with that of LVQ_PAK. The 2-d graphics can be displayed using the
   GNUPLOT plotting package. ToolDiag implements many concepts from
   Devijver and Kittler's book "Pattern Recognition -- A Statistical
   Approach" (Prentice Hall, 1982), including the optimal branch and
   bound search strategy, together with several different selection
   criteria. ToolDiag can also perform an error estimation using the
   leave-one-out method and a K-nearest-neighbor classifier. It also
   includes a learning module (Q*) that has the same functionality as
   LVQ. ToolDiag cannot handle missing values and requires continuous or
   ordered discrete numerical features.

Version:      6-SEP-91

Description: 

   This directory contains a list of over 100,000 English words
   transcribed orthographically. The list originally came from Public
   Brand Software.

   The original list contained 146,440 words, but contained thousands of
   duplicate words.  Evan Antworth resorted the list and removed the
   duplicates using the Unix utility uniq. The total number of words is
   now 109,582.

   This word list includes inflected forms, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed and -ing forms of verbs.  Thus the number of lexical stems
   represented in the list is considerably smaller than the total
   number of words.

Package:      areas/nlp/misc/itp/

Name:         ITP

Summary:      Interlinear Text Processor

Version:      1.1c (11-SEP-91)

Description: 

   The IT ('eye-tee' for Interlinear Text) software has been developed by
   the Summer Institute of Linguistics to give linguists, literary
   scholars, translators, and anthropologists a tool for developing a
   corpus of annotated interlinear text. The centerpiece of IT is a
   program called itp--an interactive and automated interlinear text
   processor.  Itp insures consistency in text analysis by retrieving
   interlinear word and morpheme annotations from an on-line database of
   lexical information which it maintains.  The interlinear text file
   produced by itp is a clean ASCII file which is accessible by other
   text processing software for purposes such as concordancing, indexing,
   or display formatting. In addition to itp, the IT package includes a
   collection of other software tools which support the conversion of
   conventional texts to interlinear text format and which support the
   maintenance of the auxiliary lexical database files.  Many interlinear
   text processing systems support only a fixed, two-line model of
   interlinear text.  IT views text as a sequence of text units, each of
   which contains a text line plus a multidimensional set of annotations
   entered according to a model provided by the analyst.  In addition to
   word and morpheme level annotations, the IT system supports freeform
   annotations of the whole text unit, such as translations.

Package:      areas/nlp/morph/map/

Name:         MAP

Summary:      Cambridge/Edinburgh Morphological Analyzer and Dictionary System

Version:      3.1 (August 1992)

Description: 

   MAP lets the user create lexicons for English (and other languages)
   suitable for use in a natural language parsing systems. In addition
   to simple look up, the system includes a rule driven morphological
   analyzer.  Thus words to be held in the lexicon in stem and affix form
   (e.g. "move", and "ed", "ing"), and the morphological analyzer can
   segment given full words into their basic components (e.g. "moved" to
   "move ed" and "travelling" to "travel ing").  thus cutting down the
   number of required entries in the lexicon.  The work is done within
   the framework of general feature grammars and two-level morphology.

   MAP is a more powerful representation formalism than KIMMO
   two-level finite state transducers, which offer only finite state
   morphosyntax and finite state morphographemics.

   inflection class information in the lexicon) as well as any morphemes
   that matched during analysis.  MORFOGEN can handle concatenative as
   well as non-concatenative morphology, and can be used for inflecting
   as well as agglutinating languages.  Analyzers using MORFOGEN have
   been written for English, French, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, Korean

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/av/

Name:         AV Parser

Summary:      Unification-based parser.

Version:      20p2

Description: 

   The AV Parser is a ``unification-based'' parser (Shieber 1986)
   for natural language parsing with ``attribute-value'' based
   theories of grammar.

   It is intended for research and instructional purposes and has the
   following features 

     - graphical user interface, with tree and attribute-value
       matrix drawing routines, and the graphics can be "cut and paste"
       into other applications (e.g. word processors), supported by a
       scrolling-pict-view window class

     - completely customizable grammar specification language (an
       LALR(1) parser-generator is included)

     - several small sample grammars are included

   The graphics routines and the LALR(1) parser generator may be
   of independent interest to the MCL community.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/flex/

Name:         FLEX

Summary:      Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator

Version:      2.4.3

Description: 

   Fles is a tool for generating programs which recognize lexical
   patterns in text.  Flex reads the given input files for a description
   of a scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of
   regular expressions and C code - these are called rules. Flex
   generates as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine
   yylex(). This file is compiled and linked with the library to produce
   an executable.  When the executable is run, it analyzes its input for
   occurrences of the regular expressions.  Whenever it finds one, it
   executes the corresponding C code.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/gb/

Name:         Gibberish

Summary:      Prolog Government-binding parser.

Version:      21-AUG-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Gibberish, a first attempt at a
   Government-Binding (GB) type parser. This parser is intended as an
   introductory 'toy' parser for natural-language-understanding courses,
   so complexity will be kept to a minimum while still being general
   enough to be easily extended. All constraints have been been
   implemented as explicit Prolog goals for perspicuity. Many
   optimizations are possible! The gapping mechanism actually performs a
   transformation of the sentence into a 'normal' form and so has been
   made general enough to move arbitrary structures through the parse tree.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/hdrug/

Name:         Hdrug

Summary:      Environment for developing logic grammars for natural languages

Version:      alfa (14-JUN-94)

Description: 

   Hdrug is an environment to develop logic grammars for natural
   languages.  The package comes with a number of example grammars,
   parsers and generators.

   The package allows easy comparison of different parsers/generators,
   extensive possibilities of compiling feature equations into Prolog
   terms, graphical (Tk), LaTeX and ordinary Prolog output of trees,
   feature structures and Prolog terms.

   Example grammars, parsers, and generators include TL (a HPSG grammar
   for Dutch), TT (a small Tree Adjoining Grammar), TG (a small DCG for
   Dutch), TC (a Constraint-based Categorial Grammar for English), TD (a
   minimal DCG), and TX (an extraposition grammar).

Version:      1.1

Description: 

   LHIP is a left-head-corner island parser compiler. The system compiles
   grammar rules to Prolog code in much the same way as the Prolog DCG
   system does. The rules themselves are an extended version of the DCG
   rules, allowing optional constituents, negation, disjunction, the
   specification of adjacency, and the ability to mark multiple heads in
   a rule body.

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/linger/

Name:         LINGER

Summary:      Language INdependent Grammatical Error Reporter

Version:      1.1 (4-SEP-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains LINGER, a tool for grammar analysis of
   Western European languages. 

   LINGER is a language-independent system to analyze natural language
   sentences and report and correct grammatical errors encountered. An
   important objective is that the system should be easily configured for a
   particular natural language by an expert in that language but not in
   computer science. 

   This library contains two versions of Linger. The older one contains
   only a French grammar. The more recent also has German, Spanish, and
   English. Both versions were contributed by Paul O'Brien and Masoud
   Yazdani, and were written in Expert Systems International Prolog-2.

              additional operations for the treatment of free word order
              proposed by Mike Reape in various publications.

      SLE     A graph-based formalism enhanced with arbitrary relations in
              the manner of Johnson and Rosner (EACL, 1989) and Doerre and
              Eisele.  Delayed evaluation is used to compute infinite
              relations.  This system has been used for the development of
              several HPSG-style grammars.

      Term    A term-based unification grammar system, originally developed
              for the support of Unification Categorial Grammar (Zeevat,

Package:      areas/nlp/parsing/tom/

Name:         Tom

Summary:      C implementation of the Tomita parsing algorithm

Version:      23-MAY-93

Description: 

   This directory contains Tom, a C implementation of the Tomita
   parsing algorithm. 

   The software constructs LR(0) parsing tables for arbitrary context
   free grammars, which you specify.  It then processes any input you
   give it and displays the resulting parse forest and optionally the
   parse stack as well.  The parse tables are also shown, if you
   requests it, since reference is made to them in the parse stack.

   One difference between this and Tomita's original algorithm is this
   algorithm has been modified into a dynamic programming algorithm,
   capable of handling all CFG's including cyclic grammars.

Name:         ABTWEAK

Summary:      Nonlinear planning with abstraction

Version:      v93 (19-APR-93)

Description: 

   ABTWEAK is a complete hierarchical, non-linear planner that extends
   David Chapman's (MIT 1986) TWEAK planner as described by 
   Yang (Waterloo) and Tenenberg (Rochester) in 1989.  This implementation
   includes a complete search strategy suited to abstraction hierarchies
   known as LEFT-WEDGE (Woods 1991). This planner and related work 
   predates that of SNLP. 

   The planning language is the first order predicate logic
   without quantifiers and logical connectives.  Given an initial state
   description and a goal state description, represented as sets of
   literals, it finds a partially ordered, least-committed set of
   operators to achieve the goal.  It is correct in that every solution
   plan found necessarily solves the goal from the initial state, and
   complete in that it will terminate with a solution if one exists.

Package:      areas/planning/systems/spa/

Name:         SPA

Summary:      Systematic Plan Adaptor

Version:      4-NOV-92

Description: 

   This directory contains SPA (Systematic Plan Adaptor), a Lisp
   case-based planning system.

   SPA is a domain-independent algorithm for case-based plan adaptation that
   is sound, complete, and systematic.  Since SPA is sound, every plan it
   returns is guaranteed to achieve the goal. Since the algorithm is complete,
   it is guaranteed to find a plan if one exists, regardless of the initial
   plan returned from the library.  Systematicity guarantees that SPA explores
   the space of partially specified, incomplete plans avoiding redundant or
   wasted effort.  The algorithm provides an excellent vehicle for further
   study, particularly on issues involving the role of heuristic and
   problem-specific knowledge in the planning process.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/planning/systems/ucpop/

Name:         UCPOP

Summary:      Partial Order Planner

Version:      2.0 (5-OCT-93); 1.00a (10-NOV-92)

Description: 

   This directory contains UCPOP, a domain independent partial order
   planner that handles an expressive action representation (conditional
   effects, universally quantified effects, and universally quantified
   preconditions and goals.  UCPOP is both complete and sound.

   UCPOP operates with actions that have conditional effects, universally
   quantified preconditions and effects, and accepts universally
   quantified goals, in addition to disjunction, negation, and
   existential quantification.  With a conservative search strategy
   UCPOP is both sound and complete for this representation. 

   The Common Lisp implementation is quite efficient requiring between
   5-50ms to explore and refine a partial plan. In particular, UCPOP is
   as fast as or faster than SNLP in comparable domains. (UCPOP is upward
   compatible with SNLP.) Instructors interested in using UCPOP in a
   classroom setting will be happy to note that the UCPOP code is
   exceptionally clean and only slightly larger than SNLP. It also has a
   CLIM-based graphical plan-space browser, a user's manual, and a
   large set of domain theories and search functions for testing.

   The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
   is a collection of test problems for Automated Theorem Proving systems
   (ATPs), using the clausal normal form of 1st order predicate logic.
   The TPTP aims to supply the ATP community with the following:

   1. A comprehensive list of the ATP test problems that are available
      today, in order to provide a simple and unambiguous reference
      mechanism.

   2. New generalized variants of those problems whose original
      presentation is hand-tailored towards a particular automated proof.

   3. The availability of these problems via FTP in a general-purpose
      format, together with a utility to convert the problems to existing
      ATP formats. (Currently the METEOR, MGTP, OTTER, PTTP, SETHEO, and 
      SPRFN formats are supported, and the utility can easily be extended 
      to produce any format required.)

   4. A comprehensive list of references and other interesting information
      on each problem. 

   5. General guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system evaluation.

Summary:      General theorem prover with domain-independent control
              of inference.

Version:      2.4 (24-JUN-94)

Description: 

   DTP (Don's Theorem Prover) is a sound and complete inference engine
   for first-order predicate calculus. It specializes in
   domain-independent control of inference.  The intended audience is
   those who need a reliable black box for drawing conclusions and
   answering queries from a knowledge base of full first-order axioms.
   It was created to incorporate all the necessary search control
   knowledge; the database itself need have no search control at all,
   either explicit or implicit (e.g. rule or conjunct ordering).  An
   ideal application, for example, would be as the back end to a machine
   learning program or mobile robot.  Such systems have a hard enough
   time just discovering true things about their worlds, much less
   figuring out how to arrange that knowledge in a computationally
   tractable way.  The philosophy in DTP is that the user need only be
   concerned about writing down true axioms, and all search control
   knowledge will be embedded in the inference engine.

   It includes some logic puzzle examples and a users manual.

   type soundness for Mini-ML. It includes some support code for
   editing and interaction in GNU Emacs.

Summary:      Framework for Resolution-based Automated Proof Procedures

Version:      2.0 (27-JUN-92)

Description: 

   FRAPPS (Framework for Resolution-based Automated Proof Procedures) is
   a portable resolution theorem-prover written in Common Lisp. 

   It facilitates the construction of a wide variety of resolution-based
   deductive systems.  FRAPPS offers the basic functionality necessary to
   build such systems, freeing users from low-level implementation
   concerns.  It is not intended for use in the construction of
   high-performance theorem provers, but rather to provide a modular and
   customizable system useful for rapid prototyping and experimentation
   in teaching and research.  An extension to FRAPPS, called "Hooked on
   FRAPPS" or "Constraints in FRAPPS" enables the introduction of
   specialized unification procedures and constraints.

              LCF 1.5 (25-AUG-92) 

Description: 

   Isabelle is a highly automated generic theorem prover written in
   Standard ML.  New logics are introduced by specifying their syntax and
   rules of inference.  Proof procedures can be expressed using tactics
   and tacticals. Isabelle comes with 8 different logics, including LCF,
   some modal logics, first-order logic, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and
   higher-order logic. Isabelle-93 is not upwardly compatible with its
   predecessor, but comes with advice on converting to the new
   simplifier.

   The Elle Verification Environment for ML (requires Isabelle-92),
   the archives of the isabelle-users mailing list, and Martin Coen's
   Substitutions system are included.

   Also included is the Cambridge LCF (Logic for Computable Functions)
   interactive theorem prover.  Proofs are conducted in PPLAMBDA, a
   natural deduction logic based on the domain theory of Dana Scott.
   PPLAMBDA is particularly suitable for proofs involving denotational
   semantics, lazy evaluation, or higher-order functions.  LCF provides a
   metalanguage (Standard ML), a functional programming language whose
   values include PPLAMBDA terms, formulas, and theorems.
   Theorem-proving primitives such as inference rules, subgoaling
   strategies (tactics), and simplifiers are implemented as ML functions.
   The user can extend LCF by programming in ML. See the book "Logic
   and Computation" by L. Paulson, Cambridge University Press, 1987,
   for details.

Package:      areas/reasonng/atp/systems/keim/

Name:         KEIM

Summary:      Tools for Building Theorem Provers

Version:      1.1 (10-OCT-93)

Description: 

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.

   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. 

   KEIM also provides functionality for the pretty-printing, error
   handling, formula parsing and user interface facilities which form a
   large part of any theorem prover. Implementing with KEIM thus allows
   the programmer to avoid a great deal of drudgery.

   The KEIM architecture, based on CLOS (Common Lisp Object System),
   allows great flexibility in the integration of new classes of objects.
   The generic function paradigm allows one to specialize the behavior of
   a function on a new type of object without changing its behavior on
   existing objects and without having to rewrite existing code.

Summary:      Prototyping of Interactive Theorem Provers

Version:      Qu-Prolog 3.2 (7-DEC-93); Ergo 4.0 (9-DEC-93)

Description: 

   Qu-Prolog is a high-level language designed primarily for rapid
   prototyping of interactive theorem provers and, more generally, for
   symbolic computation on formal languages.  Its object level includes
   quantified terms and object variables.  As an example, the interactive
   theorem prover Ergo 4.0 is implemented in Qu-Prolog. The compactness
   and high level of Ergo 4.0 source code demonstrate the advantages of
   Qu-Prolog for such applications. Ergo includes a 'window inference'
   method that is specifically designed to support hierarchical
   goal-directed proofs and allow easy access to the context of a
   subterm. Ergo also provides support for defining a variety of logics
   and support for proving schematic theorems and answer extraction.
   Ergo is being used to support the development of verified software.

Version:      15-FEB-90

Description: 

   CL-PROTOS is a Common Lisp reconstruction of the research version of
   the Protos exemplar-based learning apprentice conceived by E. Ray
   Bareiss and Bruce W. Porter of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
   at The University of Texas at Austin.  Protos was originally developed
   as an experiment in knowledge acquisition for heuristic classification
   tasks.

   The original research version of Protos was written in Prolog.  This
   Common Lisp implementation is a reconstruction, not a Prolog-to-Lisp
   rewrite.  Thus, CL-Protos differs from the original Protos in several
   places, but mostly by intention.  Ray Bareiss had a consulting role in
   this reconstruction and suggested many of the changes.

Package:      areas/reasonng/chem/congen/

Name:         DENDRAL and CONGEN

Summary:      Molecular Structure Elucidation in Organic Chemistry

Version:      

Description: 

   The DENDRAL Project was an application of computer science to the
   problem of molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry: the
   determination of the topological structure of organic compounds from
   indirect observations of these compounds with the empirical procedures
   of modern chemistry such as mass spectrometry.  This problem is
   important because the chemical and physical properties of compounds
   are determined not just by their constituent atoms, but by the
   arrangement of these atoms as well.

   "DENDRAL" is the name of the research project, which was conducted at
   Stanford University from 1965-1980, under Joshua Lederberg, Edward
   Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, and Carl Djerassi as principal
   investigators.  "DENDRAL" is also the name of the programs produced by
   the project.  DENDRAL originally stood for DENDRitic ALgorithm, a
   procedure for exhaustively and nonredundantly enumerating all the
   topologically distinct arrangements of any given set of atoms,
   consistent with the rules of chemical valence.

   The CONGEN program, the CONstrained GENerator, is one of the most
   important programs resulting from this research and embodies the
   general (acyclic and cyclic) generation algorithm in a system that
   allows a chemist to constrain its enumeration in a variety of ways.
   CONGEN is written in BCPL and is being made available to interested
   researchers as is, without any warranty or support.

Version:      18-MAR-94

Description:  

   Paris and Vencovska's paper provides a mathematical model of an
   agent's belief in an event by identifying it with his ability to
   imagine the event within the context of his previous experience.
   This approach leads to beliefs having properties different from

Description: 

   Nathan (specs1-13) is a relatively fast implementation of a defeasible
   reasoner with specificity.  It uses arguments of the kind described in
   [1,2] and its specificity comparator (LMNOP) is described in [3] which
   is a modification of the criterion of Poole.

   It solves all basic benchmark problems to the author's satisfaction.
   Its limitations in planning applications are due to the limits of its
   underlying resolution-refutation linear-input set-of-support
   theorem-prover for FOL.

   It includes a predicate for unique names.  It includes a perl
   preprocessor for extracting rules from cases.

Name:         MULTAGNT

Summary:      Prolog simulation of multi-agent tutoring.

Version:      21-AUG-93

Description: 

   MULTAGNT is a simulation of error detection and identification in a
   small tutoring setting, consisting of a Teacher and a Learner. The
   objective of MULTAGNT is to show, how through meta-logical knowledge the
   Teacher can detect and identify deficiencies in the Learner's knowledge.

   The meta-logical knowledge used consists of predicates:                   

       - can_do, for determining what a theory of an agent can prove
       - cannot_do, for determining what a theory of an agent cannot
         prove
       - demo_trace_2, for determining the erroneous clause in an
         agent's theory

   which are used by an agent (usually the Teacher) to judge the
   knowledge of another agent (referred-to as Learner). Agent's are
   represented by sets of theories, where a theory is a set of clauses.

   In this setting the Teacher's knowledge is assumed to be correct.
   Thus, it can be used as reference knowledge, for generating question
   posed to the Learner and to judge the knowledge of the Learner.

Description: 

   BELIEF is a Common Lisp implementation of the Dempster and Kong fusion
   and propagation algorithm for Graphical Belief Function Models and the
   Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter algorithm for Graphical Probabilistic
   Models. It includes code for manipulating graphical belief models such
   as Bayes Nets and Relevance Diagrams (a subset of Influence Diagrams)
   using both belief functions and probabilities as basic representations
   of uncertainty. It uses the Shenoy and Shafer version of the
   algorithm, so one of its unique features is that it supports both
   probability distributions and belief functions.  It also has limited
   support for second order models (probability distributions on
   parameters).

   Version 1.2 corresponds to CLtL2 and Version 1.1 to CLtL1.

Summary:      Produces probability intervals from raw data using

Version:      9-DEC-92

Description: 

   Few uncertainty reasoning programs go directly from raw observations
   to probabilities.  Statistical techniques in the Neyman-Pearson
   tradition are widely available, but require more expert intervention
   than is acceptable for some AI applications.  The main problem is
   identifying the reference class: as past instances are required to
   resemble the target more closely, the sample of such instances
   diminishes.  The logic for finding the right balance between relevance
   and sufficient sample size is not treated in mathematical statistics,
   but is treated in the philosophical foundations of probability.

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point

   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure.

        under the well-founded semantics by Van Gelder, Ross 
        and Schliph;

      * goal-oriented query evaluation of general logic programs 
        under the alternating fixpoint logic by Van Gelder, with 
        the restriction that the body of a clause has to be either
        an existential conjunction of literals or a universal 
        disjunction of literals.

      * goal-oriented query evaluation under the stable model semantics
        by Gelfond and Lifchitz.

      * integration with Prolog execution, and the use of Prolog syntax 
        for all programs.

Description: 

   The Integrated Generic Task Toolset provides computational mechanisms
   especially suited for certain reasoning tasks which are typically
   encountered during the course of diagnosis, design, planning, and
   similar knowledge-based activities.  By directly supporting a set of
   basic reasoning tasks, the toolset provides building blocks out of
   which more complex reasoning systems can be built.  To support a
   particular reasoning task, the toolset provides a set of appropriate
   mechanisms, each with its own control strategies and characteristic
   ways of organizing and representing knowledge.  Thus, the toolset
   provides to the knowledge system builder an advantage over rules,
   logic, semantic nets, frames, and neural nets, similar to the
   advantage that higher-level languages provide over assembly language
   for the computer programmer.

Package:      areas/robotics/systems/stiquito/

Name:         Stiquito

Summary:      Information about nitinol-propelled hexapod robots

Version:      

Description: 

   Stiquito is a small (3cm H x 7cm W x 6cm L), simple (32 parts) and
   inexpensive (< $30) nitinol-propelled hexapod robot developed at the
   Indiana University (Bloomington) Robotics Laboratory.  Its legs are
   propelled by nitinol actuator wires. Each leg has one degree of freedom.
   The robot walks up to 10 centimeters per minute and can carry a 9-volt
   cell, a MOSIS "tiny chip" and power transistors to drive the nitinol
   actuator wires. Nitinol wire (aka BioMetal, Flexinol), is a nickel-titanium
   alloy which exerts useful force as it is heated by passing a current
   through it. IUCS Technical Report 363a describes Stiquito's construction.
   This directory contains that report and related materials.

   A kit containing all the materials needed to construct a simple
   version of Stiquito and its controller is available for an extra $10
   from the address below (use attn line "Stiquito Kit"). To receive a
   video showing the assembly of Stiquito, include an additional $10 and
   add "Video" to the "Attn:" line.

Package:      areas/speech/systems/afsp/

Name:         AFsp

Summary:      Audio File I/O Routines

Version:      V1R2 (24-FEB-94)

Description: 

   The AFsp package is a library of routines for reading and writing
   audio files.  The emphasis is on providing support for the type of
   audio file used by the speech processing research community.  The
   routines have been designed to be easy to use, yet provide transparent
   support the reading of several audio file formats.  A secondary
   purpose for distributing these routines is to encourage the use of a
   standard audio file format for the header information in the output
   files.

   The following file formats are supported for reading.
   -  NIST SPHERE audio files
   -  Sun/NeXT audio files
   -  DEC audio files
   -  IRCAM SoundFiles
   -  INRS-Telecom audio files
   -  ESPS sampled data feature files
   -  Headerless audio files

   The audio file open routine automatically senses the file type and
   communicates it to the audio file reading routines. Formats are
   converted on the fly as the file is read, so the user manipulates
   floats and doesn't need to worry about the underlying data format.

   For writing, the routines produce a standard format file, though
   options are available to produce headerless files if desired.  This
   standard format is a compatible with the Sun audio file format.  There
   is provision for storing extra information in the extensible part of
   the header.

   Several audio file utilities (for copying, comparing, and filtering
   audio files) are included in the package.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/speech/systems/celp/

Name:         CELP

Summary:      FS-1016 Code Excited Linear Prediction coder

Version:      3.2a (3-AUG-93)

Description: 

   CELP is a lossy compression algorithm used for low bit rate (e.g.,
   4800 bps in U.S. Fed-Std-1016) speech coding. CELP stands for "code
   excited linear prediction". CELP coding, at 4800 bps, breaks the
   performance barrier of most Government standards, providing Consortium
   ratings of "very good" intelligibility and "excellent" quality,
   comparable to 32,000 bps CVSD.

   Like all vector quantization techniques, CELP coding is a
   frame-oriented technique that breaks a sampled input signal into
   blocks of samples (i.e., vectors) that are processed as one unit.
   CELP coding is based on analysis-by-synthesis search procedures,
   perceptually weighted vector quantization (VQ), and linear prediction
   (LP).  A 10th order LP filter is used to model the speech signal's
   short-term spectrum, or formant structure.  Long-term signal
   periodicity, or pitch, is modeled by an adaptive code book VQ.  The
   residual from the short-term LP and pitch VQ is vector quantized using
   a fixed stochastic code book.  The optimal scaled excitation vectors
   from the adaptive and stochastic code books are selected by minimizing
   a time varying, perceptually weighted distortion measure that improves
   subjective speech quality by exploiting masking properties of human
   hearing.

   The CELP coder's computational requirements are dominated by the two
   code book searches.  The computational complexity and speech quality
   of the coder depend upon the search sizes of the code books.  Any
   subset of either code book can be searched to fit processor
   constraints, at the expense of speech quality.

   Fed-Std-1016 uses an 8 kHz sample rate and a 30 ms frame size with
   four 7.5 ms subframes.  CELP analysis consists of three basic
   functions: 1) short-term linear prediction, 2) long-term adaptive code
   book search, and 3) innovation stochastic code book search.  CELP
   synthesis consists of the corresponding three synthesis functions
   performed in reverse order with the optional addition of a fourth
   function, called a postfilter, to enhance the output speech.  The
   transmitted CELP parameters are the stochastic code book index and
   gain, the adaptive code book index and gain, and 10 line spectral
   parameters (LSP).

   This directory contains the U.S. DoD's Federal-Standard-1016 based
   4800 bps code excited linear prediction voice coder version 3.2
   (CELP 3.2) Fortran and C simulation source codes. Example input and
   processed speech files are included.

Package:      areas/speech/systems/gsm/

Name:         GSM

Summary:      Implementation of the 13 kbps GSM speech coding standard.

Version:      1.0.4 (10-MAY-94)

Description: 

   This directory contains an implementation of the European GSM 06.10
   provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036,
   which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction)
   coding at 13 kbit/sec. 

   GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
   rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
   with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of 160
   16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
   The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
   recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
   form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

   The interfaces offered are a front end modeled after compress(1), and
   a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
   on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against
   the ETSI standard test patterns.

   Understanding (CSLU) at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and
   Technology (Portland Oregon). The tools can be used to compute and
   display signal representations, label speech at different levels
   (e.g., phonetic, phonemic and word), train neural network classifiers,
   and display the output of classification or recognition algorithms
   time-aligned with the speech.

   The distribution includes, among other things,

      +  LYRI, an X Windows tool for displaying data in a time
         synchronous fashion (speech signal, spectrograms, phoneme
         labels).  

      +  NOPT, a neural network training package, which uses Conjugate
         Gradient descent optimization.

      +  LIBNSPEECH, an extensive set of C library signal processing
         routines for the manipulation of speech data, including PLP
         Analysis, Rasta PLP Analysis, Linear Predictive Coding, Mel
         Cepstrum Coding, and Fast Fourier Transform.

      +  Utilities for converting file formats, such as ADC to NIST,
         to/from mu-law, filtering the speech waveform, and
         ascii/binary data streams. 

      +  A Vector-Quantizer based on the Linde Buzo and Gray (LBG) algorithm.

Name:         ARS MAGNA

Summary:      Abstract Robot Simulator

Version:      1.0 (27-JAN-93)

Description: 

   The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also
   includes a simple graphical user-interface which uses the CLX
   interface to the X window system. The simulator is written in Nisp,
   a macro-package for Common Lisp. 

   RPL is the reactive plan language interpreter.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/testbeds/eden/

Name:         Eden

Summary:      Poplog-based AI Microworld

Version:      1.0 (29-NOV-92); 2.0 (21-AUG-93)

Description: 

   Eden is a Poplog-based AI microworld developed by Simon Perkins,
   Jocelyn Paine and Edmund Chattoe of the Oxford University Artificial
   Intelligence Society. It is intended to serve as a testbed for
   learning and planning programs. Programs written in Pop-11, Prolog,
   Lisp, and ML control a "bug" that lives in a 2-dimensional world. Any
   kind of algorithm may be used to control the bug, including genetic
   algorithms, neural nets, and rule-based systems. Eden consists of a
   grid of cells, each of which can contain objects such as keys, doors,
   boulders and quicksand. Bug's objective is to find and eat a piece of
   food which the simulator has placed somewhere within this grid. To do
   this, Bug must negotiate its way towards the food while dealing
   intelligently with obstacles. Eden's laws of physics allow Bug to take
   one of several different actions when it encounters an object. The
   simulator then works out the consequences of the chosen action on Bug
   and on Eden, and displays these graphically in a Ved window. Bug's
   perceptions are updated to reflect the new state of the world, and the
   cycle repeats. 

   Eden includes PopBeast, a simple Prolog bug which can read and
   parse simple commands, extract their meaning, plan how to satisfy
   these commands, and then carry out the plans.

   Two versions of Eden are included. Version 1 is the original, which
   was used in the bug competition. Version 2 is an updated version
   used by Jocelyn Paine in an AI and Prolog course and includes a
   production-system bug. Version 2 is not compatible with the
   original and is not intended for the competition; please use the
   original for that.

Summary:      Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment testbed

Version:      MICE 2.0 (18-OCT-92); MacMICE 3.0 (1-APR-94)

Description: 

   The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is a
   tool for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems
   under a variety of conditions.  MICE simulates a two-dimensional
   grid-world in which agents may move, communicate, and affect their
   environment.  MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that
   helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides
   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain
   and its properties, etc.  

   Source code, documentation, and examples are included.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/testbeds/rsim/

Name:         RSIM

Summary:      Robot Arm Simulator

Version:      22-JUL-92

Description: 

   RSIM is a SGI-based graphical robot simulator from the University
   of Melbourne, with very nice graphics. It does discrete time
   simulation of an arbitrary linked robot arm, with full kinematics and
   dynamics. There is a discrete-time controller and a standard C interface
   so that users can create and test different controller algorithms.

   The robot simulator currently only works on SGI machines, and in a
   no-graphics mode on other machines. When the IPRS GUI standard is
   established, the authors will be converting this to run under IPRS,
   which will make it machine independent.

===========================================================================

Package:      areas/testbeds/simderel/

Name:         Simderella

Summary:      Robot Simulator

Version:      2.0.1 (17-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Simderella is a robot simulator consisting of three programs: CONNEL
   (the controller), SIMMEL (the robot simulator), and BEMMEL (the
   X-windows oriented graphics back-end). SIMMEL performs a few matrix
   multiplications, based on the Denavit Hartenberg method, calculates
   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot. It is a fast
   general-purpose display method which places separate objects in space
   depending on the homogeneous matrices it receives from SIMMEL. CONNEL
   is the controller, which must be designed by the user. In the
   distributed version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.
   No neural networks are included.  The programs use Unix sockets for
   communication, so you must have sockets, but you can run the programs
   on different machines.  Since data communication is high-level (all
   data is encoded before transmission), cross architecture portability
   is high.  In fact, CONNEL can simultaneously control a real robot and
   the simulated one.  When nothing is happening, Simderella will sleep
   and not use any processor time.

Package:      areas/vision/obvius/

Name:         OBVIUS

Summary:      Object-Based Vision and Image Understanding System

Version:      3.0.3 (30-MAY-94)

Description: 

   OBVIUS (Object-Based Vision and Image Understanding System) is an
   image-processing system based on Common Lisp and CLOS (Common Lisp
   Object System).  The system provides a flexible interactive user
   interface for working with images, image-sequences, and other
   pictorially displayable objects.  By using Lisp as its primary
   language, the system is able to take advantage of the interpretive
   lisp environment (the ``listener''), object-oriented programming, and
   the extensibility provided by incremental compilation.

   The top-level of OBVIUS is implemented in Common Lisp, thus providing
   an interpreted, object-oriented programming environment.  The
   low-level floating point operations are implemented in C for
   efficiency.  A graphical user interface, based on menus and dialog
   boxes is also provided, in addition to the Lisp interpreter
   (listener).  In the typical mode of interaction, the user types an
   expression to the lisp listener (or enters a command in a dialog box)
   and it returns a result.  A picture of that result will then be
   automatically displayed in a window.  Each window contains a circular
   stack of pictures.  The user can cycle through this stack using mouse
   clicks with certain shift (``bucky'') key combinations.  Commonly used
   operations such as histogram and zoom are also provided via mouse
   clicks.

   The system provides a library of low-level image processing
   routines, including
      -  arithmetic operations (add, multiply, lookup-table point
         operations, etc) 
      -  image statistics (mean, variance, kurtosis, maximum,
         histograms etc) 
      -  convolutions, Fourier transforms, Hilbert transforms
      -  geometric operations (crop, slice, rotate, flip-x, etc)
      -  comparisons (greater-than, etc)
      -  synthetic image generation
      -  matrix operations
   OBVIUS also provides postscript output of pictures.  Writing new 
   operations in OBVIUS is relatively simple, and it is straightforward
   to add new viewable and picture types.

   OBVIUS uses a homebrew interface to X11 (i.e., it does not use
   clx or clue). However, they eventually hope to port Obvius to a 
   CLX/CLUE platform.

Summary:      CMU Common Lisp Repository

Description:

   Welcome to the Common Lisp Repository.

   The Common Lisp Repository (formerly the Lisp Utilities Repository)
   was established by Mark Kantrowitz in 1990 to collect files and
   programs of general interest to Common Lisp programmers. Many of the
   programs will run in any Common Lisp implementation; others are easily
   ported. Information files include the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
   postings for the comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.clos newsgroups,
   introductions to some Lisp topics, and some summaries of topics of
   interest to Common Lisp programmers. In 1993 the Lisp Utilities
   Repository was incorporated into the CMU Artificial Intelligence
   Repository, and was renamed the Common Lisp Repository to reflect an
   expanded mission.

   If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
   this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
   important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
   of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
   signify your agreement to these conditions.

   Other files of interest to new users include copying.txt, the license
   for the programs written by Mark Kantrowitz. 

   To contribute files to the repository, first see section [7] of the
   readme.txt file. Then send mail to lisp-utilities-request@cs.cmu.edu. If
   possible, please put the files in ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/new/.

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/lang/lisp/  [128.2.206.173]
              Give "anonymous" (without the quotes) at the username:
              prompt and type your email address (in the form "user@host")
              at the password: prompt. NOTE: There is *no* leading slash
              before user/ai/lang/lisp/; just type "cd user/ai/lang/lisp/"
              at the ftp> prompt.

              If you will be transferring compressed files, be sure to
              type the "binary" command before retrieving the files. The
              "get" command is used to get a single file, and "mget" to
              retrieve multiple files using wildcards.  If you're using
              the "mget" command, you might want to turn off prompting
              first by using the "prompt" command.

              The Lisp Utilities Repository is kept in the Andrew File
              System (AFS) directory
              /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/
              and its subdirectories. If your site runs AFS, you can
              just cd to this directory and copy the files directly.
              (The FTP location given above is just a link to the AFS
              directory.)

              Further information about AFS can be obtained by
              sending email to afs-sales@transarc.com.

Description: 

   This directory contains source code from 
      David S. Touretzky
      "Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation"
      Benjamin/Cummings Publishers, Redwood City, CA, 1990. 592 pages.
      ISBN 0-8053-0492-4. 

   Touretzky's book is perhaps the best tutorial introduction to the
   language. It has clear and correct explanations, and covers some
   fairly advanced topics. The book is an updated Common Lisp version of
   the 1984 edition published by Harper and Row Publishers.

   Three free Lisp educational tools which were used in the book --
   Evaltrace, DTRACE and SDRAW -- are available in the lisp/ and
   evaltrace/ subdirectories.  Evaltrace is agraphical notation for
   explaining how evaluation works and is described in "Visualizing
   Evaluation in Applicative Languages" by David S. Touretzky and Peter
   Lee, CACM 45-59, October 1992.  DTRACE is a "detailed trace" which
   provides more information than the tracing tools provided with most
   Common Lisp implementations. SDRAW is a read-eval-draw loop that
   evaluates Lisp expressions and draws the result as a cons cell diagram
   (for both X11 and ascii terminals). Also available is PPMX, a tool for

Package:      lang/lisp/bookcode/norvig/

Name:         NORVIG

Summary:      Code from Peter Norvig's Lisp book

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains source code for
      Peter Norvig, "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming:
      Case Studies in Common Lisp", Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Inc.,
      1992. 946 pages. ISBN 1-55860-191-0. 

   Norvig's book provides an in-depth exposition of advanced AI
   programming techniques and includes large-scale detailed examples. The
   book is the most advanced AI/Common-Lisp programming text and
   reference currently available, and hence is not for the complete
   novice.  It focuses on the programming techniques necessary for
   building large AI systems, including object-oriented programming, and
   has a strong performance orientation.

   The text is marked by its use of "non-toy" examples to illustrate the
   techniques. All of the examples are written in Common Lisp, and copies
   of the source code are available in this directory.  Some of the
   techniques described include rule-based pattern matching (GPS, Eliza,
   a subset of Macsyma, the Emycin expert system shell), constraint
   propagation and backtracking (Waltz line-labeling), alpha-beta search
   (Othello), natural language processing (top-down, bottom-up and chart
   parsing), logic-programming (unification and Prolog), interpreters and
   compilers for Scheme, and object-oriented programming (CLOS).

   The examples are also used to illustrate good programming style and
   efficiency. There is a guide to trouble-shooting and debugging Lisp
   programs, a style guide, and a discussion of portability problems.
   Some of the efficiency techniques described include memoization,
   data indexing, compilation, delaying computation, proper use of
   declarations, avoiding garbage collection, and choosing and using the
   correct data structure.

   The book also serves as an advanced introduction to Common Lisp, with
   sections on the Loop macro, CLOS and sequences, and some coverage of 
   error handling, series, and the package facility.

Version:      

Description: 

   Source code for the benchmark programs used to gather data for 
      Richard Acuff, "Performance of Two Common Lisp Programs on
      Several Systems", Stanford University Knowledge Systems Lab
      (KSL) Report 89-02, 1989.
   Includes copies of the tech report in LaTeX and Microsoft Word
   formats. The TR contains information about running the tests. 

   Acuff benchmarks 10 Common Lisp implementations on a variety of
   hardware platforms using two moderate-sized application programs,
   BB1 1.2 and SOAR 4.4.4. Neither of these programs makes intensive
   use of numeric computation. He also considers the effects of
   compiler optimization levels and the impact of display I/O on run time.

   The lisp implementations tested include Lucid, Franz Allegro CL,
   MACL, AKCL, KCL, VaxLisp, TI Explorers, Symbolics MacIvory, 
   Symbolics 3650, and Xerox 1186.

   The results suggest that the performance of Lisp systems is very
   mcuh application dependent.

   A portable implementation of the X3J13 June 1989 specification for
   logical pathnames, as documented in Guy Steele's "Common Lisp: the
   Language" (2nd Edition), section 23.1.5 "Logical Pathnames".

   Logical Pathnames provide a facility for referring to pathnames in a
   portable manner. Logical pathnames are mapped to physical pathnames by
   a set of implementation dependent and site-dependent rules.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/memoize/

Name:         MEMOIZE

Summary:      The Automatic Memoization Facility

Version:      1.0

Description: 

   The Automatic Memoization Facility adds a practical memoization
   facility to Common Lisp. Automatic memoization is a technique by which
   an existing function can be transformed into one that "remembers"
   previous arguments and their associated results, yielding large
   performance gains for certain types of applications.  This facility
   extends the ideas from Norvig's book into what is needed for a
   practical tool for us in large programs. It adds facilities for
   bookkeeping and timing, and lets you evaluate of the timing advantages
   of memoization, and save hash tables to disk for automatic reuse in
   later sessions. 

   The code includes an overview of memoization and its applications,
   and a PostScript version of a paper on the subject that appeared in
   the Sixth International Symposium on AI, Monterrey Mexico,
   September 1993.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/resource/

Name:         RESOURCES

Summary:      Portable implementation of resources.

Version:      February 1992

Description: 

   Resources are useful for avoid excessive consing and GCing by explicitly
   maintaining pools of objects for reuse, instead of creating them when
   needed and relying on the garbage collector to flush them when they are
   no longer needed. When an object is no longer needed, it is returned
   to the pool of objects of that type, and recycled when a new object
   of that type is needed. Using resources might wind up recycling objects
   faster than incremental GC, but it isn't clear whether there are
   any real time/space savings.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/save_obj/

Name:         SAVE-OBJECT

Summary:      Saves ASCII representations of Lisp objects to a file.

Version:      9X2 (10-JUN-94)

Description:  

   SAVE-OBJECT is a recursive function which writes an ASCII
   representation of a LISP object to a designated file. SAVE-OBJECT can
   handle complicated objects, even those that include recursive
   references and circular list structure. The resulting file can be
   loaded with the standard LOAD function.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/screamer/

Name:         SCREAMER

Summary:      Adds backtracking and constraint satisfaction to Common Lisp.

Version:      3.12

Description: 

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the
   Screamer-to-Common-Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise,
   only small portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking
   primitives, Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers
   for languages in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   The Screamer user-contributed code includes a pedagogical
   implementation of the SNLP planning algorithm in Screamer and code to
   add a layer on top of Screamer to permit the retraction of assertions.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ext/tables/

Name:         DEFTABLE

Summary:      Unifies interface to Common Lisp's table-like data structures.

Version:      1992

Description: 

   The DEFTABLE macro unifies the interface to Common Lisp's table-like
   data structures (e.g., association lists, property lists, and hash
   tables, vectors), providing a concise, lightweight syntax. Later, when
   it's time to tune the performance of your program, you can specify how
   each table type will be implemented. For the purpose of this program,
   a table is anything you can put key/value pairs into and subsequently
   retrieve the value using the key.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/ilu/

Name:         ILU

Summary:      Xerox PARC Inter-Language Unification

Version:      1.6.4 (18-JUN-94)

Description: 

   ILU (pronounced eye'-loo) is a system that promotes software
   interoperability via interfaces.  Interfaces between what?  Whatever
   units of program structure are desired; we call them by the generic
   term "modules".  They could be parts of one process, all written in
   the same language; they could be parts written in different languages,
   sharing runtime support in one memory image; they could be parts
   running in different memory images on different machines (on different
   sides of the planet).  A module could even be a distributed system
   implemented by many programs on many machines.  Calls across ILU
   interfaces involve only as much mechanism as necessary for the calling
   and called modules to interact.  In particular, when the two modules
   are in the same memory image and use the same data representations,
   the calls are direct local procedure calls -- no stubs or other RPC
   mechanisms are involved.

   ILU modules are known by their interfaces.  A module interface is
   specified once in ILU's object-oriented Interface Specification
   Language (called, simply, ISL).  For each of the particular
   programming languages supported by ILU (currently Common Lisp, ANSI C,
   C++, and Modula-3; Python, Tcl, and GNU Emacs-Lisp are in the works),
   a version of the interface in that particular programming language can
   be generated.  The ILU kernel library provides services which may be
   used by the language-specific interface to overcome intermodule
   language or address space differences.

   Many existing RPC systems, such as Xerox XNS Courier, ONC RPC, and OSF
   DCE RPC, have strong notions of interfaces.  ILU allows binding to
   such services provided by such systems if their interfaces can be
   described in ISL.  ISL has been designed to facilitate such
   description (currently, only for ONC RPC; Courier and DCE RPC are in
   progress).  The binding to such RPC services is done in such a way as
   to be indistinguishable from binding to other ILU modules.  In fact,
   properly constructed ILU modules can appear as native RPC services,
   and can be manipulated by non-ILU tools designed to work with those
   RPC services.

   Similarly, the Object Management Group's (OMG) Common Object Request
   Broker Architecture (CORBA) defines modules with explicit interfaces.
   ILU allows modules that can be described with a safe subset of OMG
   CORBA IDL to be used as ILU modules, as well, though the ILU object
   model is not quite the same as the OMG CORBA object model.  In fact,
   people wishing to experiment with CORBA may find ILU a useful
   experimental platform, as it does allow module specification with OMG
   IDL, and does generate ANSI C support as specified in Draft 1.2 of the
   OMG CORBA specification.  As the OMG specification for a C++ mapping
   is agreed upon, we intend to provide that mapping for our C++ support,
   as well.

   Release 1.6.4 is intended as a beta release.  Major efficiency
   improvements and some usability improvements are planned for the next
   release.  It has been tested lightly on SunOS 4.1.3, Sun's Solaris
   2.3, and SGI's IRIX 5.2.  It is designed to be highly portable, and a
   port to the Macintosh has been done (but is not included in this
   release).

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/cbrk/

Name:         CBREAK

Summary:      Turns CBREAK mode on and off to allow Lisp to read the
              input character by character.

Version:      

Description: 

   Most UNIX-based Lisp implementations buffer the input until a
   carriage return is seen. This means that functions like
   READ-CHAR, LISTEN and READ-CHAR-NO-HANG don't work as the
   programmer might expect. For example to reply to Y-OR-N-P, one not
   only has to type a Y or N, but hit the return key as well.

   This package contains example code that shows how to turn CBREAK
   mode on and off from within Lisp. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/dates/

Name:         Date Formatter

Summary:      Lisp code for formatting dates and times nicely.

Version:      

Description: 

   Provides a set of functions for formatting dates and times nicely
   in Lisp.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/fast_io/

Name:         Fast_IO

Summary:      Code and discussion of fast file IO in Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   A common complaint about Lisp implementations is that the file I/O
   is slow. Although the Lisp standard does not provide primitives for
   reading and writing blocks of data, it is possible to do this in most
   Lisp implementations. This package gives an example of how to do this.
   When data is read and written in this manner, the speed of file i/o
   approaches that of C programs.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/plisp/

Name:         PLISP

Summary:      Lisp-to-PostScript compiler.

Version:      1987

Description: 

   PostScript is a programming language for the description of images on
   a printed page.  Many laser printers now use PostScript.  A very rich
   set of graphic operations which allow complex images to be described
   in a simple and concise manner are provided by the PostScript
   language.

   While many systems, such as Tex, pic, or MacDraw, generate PostScript
   code, none of these allow the user access to the full power of the
   PostScript language.  However, programming directly in PostScript can
   be difficult.  Both the syntax and semantics of the language are
   oriented more toward simplicity of execution rather than ease of
   programming.  The purpose of this compiler is to take the basic
   structure of Common Lisp and use it as an alternative representation
   of a PostScript program.  While the basic graphic operators of
   PostScript are retained, Lisp-like function definition, control flow,
   and variable binding become available.  Macros, defined constants, and
   function libraries have also been provided.  The PLisp compiler
   generates PostScript code which is guaranteed not to contain errors in
   stack usage.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/query/

Name:         QUERY

Summary:      Lisp code for querying the user.

Version:      

Description: 

   The QUERY package generalizes the capabilities of the Lisp
   functions Y-OR-N-P and YES-OR-NO-P, and is similar in many ways to
   the Symbolics FQUERY function. There are several major differences,
   one of which is QUERY's ability to timeout with a default value. In
   addition to redefining Y-OR-N-P and YES-OR-NO-P in terms of QUERY,
   this package defines Y-OR-N-P-WAIT and YES-OR-NO-P-WAIT to illustrate
   the timeout capability. More complicated queries are possible using
   the QUERY function.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/rpc/

Name:         RPC

Summary:      Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC.

Version:      

Description: 

   Common Lisp implementation of SUN RPC that currently runs only in
   Xerox Common Lisp, but was written with portability in mind. It has
   been the basis of many robust clients (including NFS) but includes
   little support for the implementation of network services.  The code
   was originally written by Jeff Finger while at Stanford, and has been
   subsequently revised at Xerox by Bill van Melle.

   The authors hope that someone will be enticed to: 
      (1) port the code other Common Lisp implementations; and further
      (2) extend the system to support implementation of servers
   Both of these are significant programming efforts, requiring
   familiarity with both SUN RPC and the foreign function interface of
   the target Lisp.  The first task also requires some familiarity with
   Interlisp-D. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/sockets/

Name:         SOCKETS

Summary:      Using UNIX sockets from Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   This package contains posts and email about socket communication in
   Lisp. They include code written by Vince Baker for socket communication
   in AKCL and by Joe Konstan for Allegro and Lucid. The LSP_SCKT package
   is a stream-based socket interface for Allegro and Lucid written by
   Mark Kantrowitz.

   The contents is as follows:

     lsp_sckt           Stream-based interface to sockets.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/tl/

Name:         TL

Summary:      Support for Top-Level interaction loops in Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   This package implements a few general purpose support routines for "top
   level" interaction in Lisp. The function Top-Level implements a lisp
   listener and command interpreter similar in behavior to the alias
   command feature in Franz or the command prompt in Symbolics'
   Genera. Top-level is completely generic. You create your own
   interpreters or applications by defining new command tables. A sample
   application called TL is provided that implements an interpreter that
   supports a few commands for general lisp interaction, such as Package,
   Cload, Macroexpand etc. The function Ask-User is a general purpose
   user-query facility.  The function Edit-Object supports interactive
   clos object editing by dynamically defining a command table appropriate
   to the object and invoking a Top-Level loop to implement editing
   commands.  

   TL is part of the Common Music (CM) music composition language, but is
   generic enough and portable enough to be of use in other applications.
   CM itself is available by anonymous ftp from ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu
   [36.49.0.93] and ftp.zkm.de [192.101.28.17] in the files pub/cm.tar.Z.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/io/xp/

Name:         XP

Summary:      XP Common Lisp pretty printer

Version:      

Description:

   XP provides efficient and flexible support for pretty printing
   in Common Lisp.  Its single greatest advantage is that it allows the
   full benefits of pretty printing to be obtained when printing
   data structures, as well as when printing program code.

   XP is efficient, because it is based on a linear time algorithm that
   uses only a small fixed amount of storage.  XP is flexible, because
   users can control the exact form of the output via a set of special
   FORMAT directives.  XP can operate on arbitrary data structures,
   because facilities are provided for specifying pretty printing methods
   for any type of object.

   Note: This will be part of the new Common Lisp standard, so
     distributing it separately will be unnecessary in a few years
     once all implementations support the new standard.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/iterate/

Name:         Iterate

Summary:      An iteration macro for Lisp.

Version:      1.2, 7/26/91

Description:  

   Iterate is Jonathan Amsterdam's alternative to SERIES and the LOOP
   macro. It provides a superset of LOOP's features in a much more
   pleasant, Lisp-like syntax. Iterate is also extensible, has better
   support for nested loops, and generates inline code.

===========================================================================

Topic:        lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/

Name:         LOOP

Summary:      A variety of Loop macros.

Description:

   This directory contains five different implementations of Loop
   macros. The mit/, cmu/ and symbolics/ directories contain various
   implementations of "the" Loop macro, as discussed in the various
   editions of CLtL and the draft ANSI Common Lisp specification. 

   The MIT implementation is from the CLtL1 era. The CMU implementation
   conforms to CLtL2, but is slightly buggy.  The Symbolics
   implementation is an updated (1991) version of the MIT Loop macro. It
   claims ANSI Loop conformance, and includes a test suite.

   In addition, there is SLOOP and YLOOP. SLOOP is William Schelter's
   loop macro (doesn't implement the CLtL specs). YLOOP is Frank Ritter
   and Jim Panagos' implementation of the Yale loop macro described in
   McDermont, Charniak and Riesbeck's AI programming book.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/cmu/

Name:         CMU LOOP 

Summary:      CMU Implementation of ANSI Loop Macro

Version:      1.8 5/24/91 19:37:33 wlott, with bug fixes by mkant

Description: 

   CMU CLtL2-compatible Loop Macro. Please note that it uses the
   WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR feature added by X3J13, which may not be
   available in all "CLtL2-compatible" lisps.  Also, since the macro was
   implemented from scratch, it adheres to the (rather vague) word of the
   specification, but not necessarily to historical precedent (e.g., loop
   variables are not bound in FINALLY clauses, etc.).

   Some bug fixes and portability enhancements by mkant, but still
   slightly buggy. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/mit/

Name:         MIT LOOP

Summary:      The original MIT Loop macro implementation.

Version:      

Description: 

   This is a copy of the "officially sanctioned" MIT LOOP macro for
   running in Common Lisp. There are several differences between this
   LOOP macro and the macro incorporated into the ANSI Common Lisp
   specification. Some small changes have been made to the file to bring
   it closer to the specification, but for better conformance, see the
   Symbolics 1991 update. The original unaltered file is in the original/
   directory.

   The LOOP Iteration Macro is a conversion of LOOP 829, which is fairly
   close to that released with Symbolics Release 6.1 (803).  This
   conversion was made by Glenn Burke (one of the original author/maintainers);
   the work was performed at Palladian Software, in Cambridge MA, April 1986.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/sloop/

Name:         SLOOP

Summary:      William Schelter's SLOOP iteration facility.

Version:      

Description: 

   SLOOP is a Common Lisp portable iteration facility written by William
   Schelter.  SLOOP is extremely user extensible, allowing one to easily
   redefine the behavior and add additional collections and iteration
   paths. There is a significant amount of backwards compatibility with
   the original MIT loop macro.

   The file includes several examples of extensions, such as
      .. FOR v IN-FRINGE x ..         (iterate through the fringe of a tree x)
      .. SUM v ..                     (add the v)
      .. AVERAGING v ..      
      .. FOR sym IN-PACKAGE y         (iterate through symbols in a package y)
      .. COLLATE v ..                 (for collecting X into an ordered list),
      .. FOR (elt i) IN-ARRAY ar      (iterate through array ar, with index i)
      .. FOR (key elt) IN-TABLE foo.. (if foo is a hash table)

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/loop/symbolix/

Description: 

   This package contains the Symbolics update of the MIT LOOP macro
   for ANSI conformance. It includes a test suite and is extendible.

Summary:      Portable implementation of the Yale LOOP macro.

Version:      

Description: 

   This package contains YLOOP, Frank Ritter and Jim Panagos'
   implementation of the Yale loop macro as described in McDermot,
   Charniak and Riesbeck's AI programming book.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/iter/series/

Name:         SERIES 

Summary:      Common Lisp looping macro package 

Version:      November 26, 1991

Description: 

   The benefits of programming in a functional style are well known.  In
   particular, algorithms that are expressed as compositions of functions
   operating on series/vectors/streams of data elements are much easier
   to understand and modify than equivalent algorithms expressed as
   loops.  Unfortunately, many programmers hesitate to use series
   expressions.  In part, this is due to the fact that series expressions
   are typically implemented very inefficiently.

   The Common Lisp Series macro package evaluates a wide class of series
   expressions very efficiently by transforming them into iterative
   loops.  When using this class of series expressions, programmers can
   obtain the advantages of expressing computations as series expressions
   without incurring any run-time overhead.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/match/miranda/

Name:         

Summary:      Select Match

Version:      

Description: 

   The SELECT-MATCH macro is useful for implementing interpreters,

        (defun eval-expr (x)
          (select-match x
            ('add x y) => (+ x y)
            ('sub x y) => (- x y)
            ('mul x y) => (* x y)
            ('div x y) => (/ x y)))

   and also for programs in general,

        (defun my-append (a b)
          (select-match a
            'nil      =>  b
            (hd . tl) =>  (cons hd (my-append tl b))))

        (defun fact (n)
          (select-match n
             '0  =>  1
             n   =>  (* n (fact (1- n)))))

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/match/nregex/

Name:         NREGEX

Summary:      Lisp-based regular expression parser.

Version:      4/8/92

Description: 

   This regular expression parser operates by taking a regular expression
   and breaking it down into a list consisting of lisp expressions and
   flags.  The list of lisp expressions is then taken in turned into a
   lambda expression that can be later applied to a string argument for
   parsing.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/bell/

Name:         Bell's number

Summary:      Lisp code for a function thar return's Bell's number.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/clasp/

Name:         CLASP and CLIP

Summary:      Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package

Version:      CLASP 1.3.2 (4-FEB-94); CLIP 1.4 (4-FEB-94)

Description: 

   CLASP (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package) provides the basic
   functionality of a statistics package. The CLIM interface includes a
   "notebook" that is both a "desktop" for icons and a Lisp interactor
   pane, and uses BBN's SciGraph package for plotting.  The Common Lisp
   Instrumentation Package (CLIP) is available along with CLASP.  CLIP is
   designed to allow AI system developers and evaluators a portable way to
   define and manage "alligator clips" for instrumenting their programs.
   CLIP produces data about program behavior in CLASP format, as well as
   other commonly used data formats.  It currently has facilities to
   support experiment design, such as scenario scripting and factorial
   combination of independent variables, and can collect data in
   summary form (at the end of each trial) or based upon the occurrence of
   specific events (both periodic and non-periodic).

   Using CLIP/CLASP the experimenter can:

      - collect and filter data while a program runs 

      - define and automatically run experiments to evaluate a program's
        behavior in different conditions

      - transform, filter and partition data in powerful ways

      - examine data graphically and statistically 

      - run parametric and computer-intensive tests

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/clmath/

Name:         CLMath

Summary:      Common Lisp library of mathematical functions.

Version:      1989

Description: 

   CLMath is a Lisp library of mathematical functions that calculate
   hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, Bessel functions,
   elliptic integrals, the gamma and beta functions, and the incomplete
   gamma and beta functions.  There are probability density functions,
   cumulative distributions, and random number generators for the normal,
   Poisson, chi-square, Student's T, and Snedecor's F functions. Discrete
   Fourier Transforms. Multiple linear regression, Fletcher-Powell
   unconstrained minimization, numerical integration, root finding,
   and convergence. Code to factor numbers and to do the
   Solovay-Strassen probabilistic prime test is included.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/hist/

Name:         HIST

Summary:      Simple histogram facility using Format strings for output.

Version:      28-JUN-90

Description: 

   Hist is a macro of form (HIST (min max [bucket-size]) . body)

   Creates a histogram with buckets of the specified size (defaults to
   1), spanning the range from Low (inclusive) to High (exclusive), with
   two additional buckets to catch values below and above this range.
   The body is executed as a progn, and every call to Hist-Record within
   the body provides a value for the histogram to count.  When Body
   exits, the histogram is printed out and Hist returns NIL.

   A simple example:
      (hist (0 10) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 10)))

   This example may make the RANDOM distribution look more normal:
      (hist (0 10 2) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 10)))

   This example will show you overflow buckets:
      (hist (2 12) (dotimes (i 1000) (random 15)))

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/maxima/

Name:         MAXIMA

Summary:      Information about MAXIMA for Common Lisp

Version:      4-155, 13-DEC-89

Description: 

   Maxima is a Common Lisp version by William Schelter based on the
   original Macsyma implemented at MIT. It is based on the release
   from MIT to the DOE of the original MACSYMA.

   We have not included MAXIMA in the repository because of concerns
   about the copyright status of the code. Although the changes made
   by William Schelter to port Maxima to Common Lisp are free, the
   original Macsyma isn't. One previously was able to obtain a license
   for MAXIMA from 
      National Energy Software Center (NESC)
      Argonne National Laboratory
      9700 South Cass Avenue
      Argonne, IL 60439
      Tel: 615-576-2606, 708-972-7250
   for fees ranging from $1300 to $2800, with the cheaper licenses for
   universities. However, the NESC doesn't seem to exist any more,
   so the status of the code is unclear. 

   A copy of a message from Richard Petti, President of Macsyma Inc.,
   on this issue is included in this directory.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/mma/

Name:         MockMma

Summary:      Mathematica-style parser written in Common Lisp. 

Version:      1.5, 19 Nov 1992

Description: 

   This program is a rough shell that has only rudimentary (but fast)
   parsing, display, numeric evaluation, polynomial/rational
   simplification, integration, and some pattern matching.  It is not a
   substitute for Mathematica (r), Maple (r), etc., and is not intended
   to compete with such commercial systems.  This system can be used for
   experimentation, such as inserting an entirely different evaluation
   strategy or an entirely different numeric system, and re-run your
   "Mathematica(r) source code" through it.  Or hook it up to your
   favorite other semantics for solve, integrate, and so on (e.g. JACAL,
   Reduce, Macsyma, Maple, ...).

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/quine/

Name:         QUINE

Summary:      Quine Tree algorithm for satisfiability

Version:      1-DEC-92

Description: 

   A satisfiability program implemented in Common Lisp. It is supposed
   to work on any boolean expression, but was mainly designed for 3sat.
   If you use a propositional inference engine in your work, this
   program is probably faster in a majority of cases.

   On Mitchell, Selman, Levesque hard spot problems, the program takes
   from 1 minute to 15 minutes on 150 variable instances, including
   unsatisfiable instances, averaging under 10 minutes.  The program
   appears to run in time N*2^(N/22) on MSL hard spot instances. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/math/random/

Name:         

Summary:      Pseudo-random number generator implemented in Common Lisp.

Version:      17-MAY-93

Description: 

   This is a portable pseudo-random number generator for Common LISP. It
   is seedable, has a periord of 10^30 passes all of the statistical
   tests and is four times faster than the built-in ones provided in
   Allegro and Lucid.

   The program was converted from a C program that was converted from a
   FORTRAN program. The correctness of the generator can be verified by
   the TEST function at the end of the file.

   The FORTRAN version was written by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman of
   Florida State University. George Marsaglia originally proposed this
   algorithm (see reference below). The C port was performed by Karl-L.
   Noell <NOELL@DWIFH1.BITNET> and Helmut Weber <WEBER@DWIFH1.BITNET> of
   the FHW (Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, W. Germany) Department of Computer
   Science in April 1989.

Summary:      A LALR(1) parser-generator for Lisp.

Version:      

Description: 

   LALR is a parser generator for Common Lisp (a Lisp version of YACC).
   Given a CFG grammar, a list of lexical or terminal categories, and
   an atomic end marker, produces Lisp code for a LALR(1) parser for
   the grammar. The Lisp code defines a function LALR-PARSER that may
   be used to parse input.

   Includes a sample grammar.

Description: 

   Contains parsing routines for time and date strings. PARSE-TIME
   returns the universal time integer for the time and/or date given in
   the string.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/parsing/tree_fmt/

Name:         PNODE and GNODE

Summary:      Formatting of Parse Trees for Display

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains two programs for formatting parse trees for
   display.  

   The first is a simple portable tree indenter designed for natural
   language parse trees. It includes primitive facilities for printing
   subscripts, and is smart about breaking up long lines, such as
   formatting
      (s (np (det The) (noun cat)) (vp (verb chased) (np (det the) (noun mouse))))
   as
      (s (np (det The) (noun cat))
         (vp (verb chased)
             (np (det the) (noun mouse))))

   The second is a Macintosh Common Lisp program that draws parse trees
   in two dimensions, each tree in its own window.  The code uses MCL
   extensions to Common Lisp to create windows and draw graphics in them.
   (The result looks something like the example below, but with real
   graphics and in a real window, of course, not as ASCII art). The code
   supports all sorts of nifty features like sub- and superscripts at
   left and right, boldface and italics, different line shapes, weights,
   and fills, arbitrary connections between nodes, and more.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/parsing/zebu/

Name:         ZEBU

Summary:      Zebu parser generator for Common Lisp

Version:      2.9

Description: 

   Zebu is a parser generator for Common Lisp. It is an extension written
   in Common Lisp of the Scheme version. (Scheme version originally
   implemented by William M. Wells III.)  It generates a LALR(1) parsing
   table.  To parse a string with a grammar, only this table and a driver
   need to be loaded. The present version of Zebu contains the ability to
   define several grammars and parsers simultaneously, a declarative
   framework for specifying the semantics, capabilities to define and use
   meta-grammars (grammars to express a grammar in), as well as
   efficiency related improvements.  The current version compiles a
   grammar with 300 productions (including dumping of the tables to disk)
   in approx 2 minutes and 30 seconds on a HP 9000/370.

   The current version can also produce a generator using a
   'reversible grammar' notation, in addition to a parser. 

   Documentation is included with the distribution.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/search/queues/

Name:         Queue Search

Summary:      Queue-based implementation of generic search.

Version:      7-AUG-90

Description: 

   Queue-based implementation of a generic framework for search. It is
   intended as a pedagological tool for teaching students about the
   variety of forms of search as discussed in the AI literature,
   including depth-first search, hill climbing search, breadth-first
   search, beam search, best-first search, branch and bound, branch and
   bound with underestimates, and A* search.

   When learning about some types of search commonly used in AI systems,
   it often helps to think in terms of a queue of nodes to be searched.
   Given a function which tests for the goal node, a function which finds
   the node's children, a function which dequeues a node for testing, and
   a function which merges the children into the queue, one can implement
   a wide variety of search functions. Comparing the functions used can
   help the student understand the difference between the various types
   of search.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/cgol/

Name:         CGOL

Summary:      Algol-like language that compiles into Common Lisp.

Version:      1

Description: 

   CGOL is algol-like language developed originally by Vaughn Pratt.
   This program is a Common Lisp implementation of CGOL that is
   translated into Lisp before execution. It was written by a UC
   Berkeley graduate student, Tom Phelps, as a term project, so there
   may still be some rough edges. There is a lot of documentation in
   the distribution, including the "original" CGOL memo (pratt.memo). 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/fontstrp/

Name:         Font Stripper

Summary:      Strips Symbolics font information from a text file.

Version:      7/24/87

Description: 

   This program will strip Symbolics font information from a text file.
   The syntax is "font-stripper filename" or "font-stripper in-filename
   out-filename".  If only a single filename is given, then the
   font-stripper replaces the source file with the font stripped output.
   With two filenames, the output file gets the font-stripped output.

   Warning: The program doesn't correctly deal with the case where
   in-filename is the same as out-filename.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/glisp/

Name:         GLISP

Summary:      Alternate syntaxes for Common Lisp

Version:      1.2

Description: 

   Generalized Lisp (or Glisp for short) is a coordinated set of high
   level syntaxes for Common Lisp.  Initially GLisp consists of three
   dialects: Mlisp, Plisp and ordinary Lisp, together with an extensible
   framework for adding others.  Mlisp (Meta-Lisp) is an Algol-like
   syntax for people who don't like writing parentheses. For example,
   one can write print("abc", stream) instead of (print "abc" stream).
   Plisp (Pattern Lisp) is a pattern matching rewrite-rule language.
   Plisp is a compiler-compiler; its rules are optimized for writing
   language translators.  All dialects may be freely intermixed in a
   file. The translators for all dialects are written in Plisp, as is
   the Glisp translator framework itself. Support routines for the
   translators are written in Mlisp and/or Lisp. All dialects are
   translated to Common Lisp and execute in the standard Common Lisp
   environment. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/haskell/

Name:         HASKELL

Summary:      Yake Haskell system.

Version:      2.05

Description: 

   Includes X Windows support.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/

Name:         INFIX

Summary:      Infix reader macro for Common Lisp.

Version:      14-OCT-93

Description: 

   This is an implementation of an infix reader macro.  It allows the
   user to type arithmetic expressions in the traditional way (e.g., 1+2)
   when writing Lisp programs instead of using the normal Lisp syntax
   (e.g., (+ 1 2)).  It is not intended to be a full replacement for the
   normal Lisp syntax. If you want a more complete alternate syntax for
   Lisp, get a copy Apple's MLisp or Pratt's CGOL.

   Although similar in concept to the Symbolics infix reader (#<DIAMOND>),
   no real effort has been made to ensure compatibility beyond coverage
   of at least the same set of basic arithmetic operators. There are several
   differences in the syntax beyond just the choice of #I as the macro
   character. (Our syntax is a little bit more C-like than the Symbolics
   macro in addition to some more subtle differences.)

   We initially chose $ as a macro character because of its association
   with mathematics in LaTeX, but unfortunately that character is already
   used in MCL. We switched to #I() because it was one of the few options
   remaining.

   Documentation included at the top of the source file. Examples and
   testing routines at the end.

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/measures/

Name:         MEASURES

Summary:      Handles engineering numbers and measures in Lisp.

Version:      2.0

Description: 

   MEASURES is a system to handle engineering numbers and measures in
   Common Lisp. Some documentation can be found in the file
   measures.doc and examples in measures-example.lisp in the distribution.  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/name_spc/

Name:         One Name Space (ONS)

Summary:      Provides for a single Lisp name space for functions and variables

Version:      

Description: 

   ONS (One Name Space) provides a buggy reader macro for providing a
   single Lisp syntax for functions and variables. It bypasses the
   function-bindings of symbols and uses the value-bindings for everything.
   ONS also provides for currying function-calls automatically.

   The user of this module writes code that looks like this:

      [if [> x y]
        [print x]
        [print y]]

   and the bracket readmacro converts it into this:

      (if (funcall > x y)
        (funcall print x)
        (funcall print y))

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/parcil/

Name:         PARCIL

Summary:      A Parser for C syntax In Lisp

Version:      0.1a

Description: 

   PARCIL is a parser for a subset of the syntax for the C programming
   language.  PARCIL is written in Common Lisp, making it potentially
   a useful building block for user interfaces for people who do not
   like prefix syntax.

   PARCIL is a recursive descent parser optimized to parse C.  This makes it
   fairly brittle and difficult to modify.  However, it does make it fairly
   fast, and it also allows the parser to deal with lots of C idiosyncrasies
   which are difficult to implement in general-purpose parsers, such as
   operator precedence and prefix and postfix operators.

   NOTE: PARCIL is incomplete, providing no support for high-level C
   constructs, and does very little error checking.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/syntax/trans/ilisp/

Name:         LTRAN

Summary:      Code for translating Interlisp to Common Lisp.

Version:      9-JAN-92

Description: 

   This package translates Lisp programs written in Interlisp to several
   other dialects of Lisp.  This package was originally written in
   Interlisp by Gordon Novak, and was ported to Common Lisp by
   itself with some help from Peter Karp.  This package should only be
   considered an AID to the process of porting a program from Interlisp
   to another dialect.  The package will perform approximately 95% of the
   translation process, but it is very likely to miss certain constructs
   in the translation process, which must be translated by hand.  Use
   this package at your own risk; its performance is not warrantied in
   any way.  

   Note that there are two versions of this translator: an Interlisp
   version and a Common Lisp version.  The Interlisp version is a single
   standalone file; the Common Lisp version includes a shell script that
   uses several Unix utilities to preprocess the Interlisp source file,
   plus a Common Lisp program that does the higher-level translation.

Name:         COVER

Summary:      Common Lisp test case coverage determination tool

Version:      15-SEP-91

Description: 

   The COVER Common Lisp test case coverage determination tool can help
   assess the coverage of a suite of test cases.  When a suite of test
   cases for a program is run in conjunction with COVER, statistics are
   kept on which conditions in the code for the program are exercised and
   which are not.  Based on this information, COVER can print a report of
   what has been missed.  By devising tests that exercise these
   conditions, a programmer can extend the test suite so that it has more
   complete coverage.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/testing/rt/

Name:         RT

Summary:      Common Lisp regression tester

Version:      19-DEC-90

Description: 

   Everyone knows that it is important to test a system thoroughly
   whenever it is changed.  However, it is far from easy to come up with
   good tests and irritatingly laborious to keep track of a lot of tests
   and run them time and again.  The RT Common Lisp regression tester
   automates part of this task.

   Using RT, the programmer still has to come up with tests.  However, RT
   maintains a database of these tests and automatically runs them when
   requested.  This can take a lot of computer time, but does not take
   any of the programmer's time.  As a result, any bugs found by running
   the tests---and this is a lot more bugs than you might think---are
   essentially found for free.

Version:      

Description: 

   Contains two programs for managing large systems of Lisp source files.
   Mark Kantrowitz's DEFSYSTEM takes a structural approach, while
   Joachim Laubsch's DEFSYS takes the procedural approach of the original
   Symbolics defsystem.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/defsys/laubsch/

Name:         DEFSYS

Summary:      A Portable System Definition Facility for Common Lisp

Version:      5.0, 11-AUG-92

Description: 

   In order to maintain a large system of modules with complex load and
   compile time dependencies, a declarative and central representation of
   a system, its subsystems and modules is preferable to one where these
   dependencies are associated with a particular module (e.g. by REQUIRE
   and PROVIDE).

   Since in Lisp the definition of other languages is a frequently used
   programming technique, the load and compile time dependencies are also
   parameterized by the compiler or loader to be used for a module or
   system.  The Portable System Definition Facility is intended to meet
   this need.

   Laubsch's DEFSYS is an extended version of the portable defsystem
   facility originally written by Douglas Rand <dsrand@mitre.org>.

   [Note: Laubsch's DEFSYS takes the procedural approach to system
   definition. This is the same approach used by the original
   Symbolics defsystem.]

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/defsys/mkant/

Name:         DEFSYSTEM

Summary:      Portable and flexible system definition facility for Common Lisp

Version:      2.5 8-JAN-92

Description: 

   This is a portable system definition facility for Common Lisp.
   Though home-grown, the syntax was inspired by fond memories of the
   defsystem facility on Symbolics 3600's. However, rather than follow in
   the Symbolic procedural approach, where the system definition
   intermixes compilation and other instructions in the definition, we
   took a structural approach. The system definition defines only the
   structure of the system. The order of files for compilation is
   computed using a topological sort of the file-dependency constraints.
   This divorces the actual operation from the structure of the system,
   permitting one to define other operations on the system. For example,
   Alex Repenning <ralex@cs.colorado.edu> has implemented an efficient
   Boyer Moore string search over the files in the system (see
   search-systems.lisp in the distribution).

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/lint/

Name:         LINT

Summary:      Lint for Common Lisp.

Version:      6/13/89 11:26:40

Description: 

   Implements a set of compiler style checkers that warn when a function
   does not conform to Common Lisp.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/metering/

Name:         Metering

Summary:      Portable Code Profiling Tool

Version:      v2.1 (25-JAN-94)

Description: 

   METERING is a portable code profiling tool, for gathering timing and
   consing statistics while a program is running. This is a combination
   of the Monitor package written by Chris McConnell and the Profile
   package written by Skef Wholey and Rob MacLachlan, with several
   extensions.  Monitors the use of functions and macros: calls, CPU
   time, clock time, and storage use.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/psgraph/

Name:         PSGRAPH

Summary:      PostScript DAG Grapher

Version:      Jan-92

Description: 

   The PSGrapher is a set of Lisp routines that can be called to produce
   PostScript commands to display a directed acyclic graph. It uses the
   same basic algorithm as the ISI Grapher.  It is slower than the ISI
   grapher, but produces much prettier output than using Xdump to copy an
   ISI Grapher screen image to a PostScript printer.  It also allows
   arbitrary information to be displayed with a node, and can print as
   many output pages as are necessary to accommodate large graphs (subject
   to PostScript printer limits, typically one or two thousand nodes).

   The PSgrapher is small enough and easy enough to use to be included
   in other systems without pain.  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/sequel/

Name:         SEQUEL

Summary:      For generating type-secure and efficient Lisp programs.

Version:      7.0 (1-FEB-94)

Description: 

   SEQUEL (SEQUEnt processing Language) is designed both as a general
   purpose AI language for generating type-secure and efficient Lisp
   programs and as a very high level specification language for
   implementing logics on the computer. Designed at the University of
   Leeds, SEQUEL compiles sequent-calculus specifications of arbitrary
   logics to working proof assistants.  The sequent calculus
   specifications are compiled into Horn clauses and from Horn clauses
   into virtual machine instructions of an abstract machine SLAM (SequeL
   Abstract Machine) which then translates these instructions into
   efficient Lisp code using WAM-style compilation techniques.  Although
   a functional programming language, SEQUEL includes facilities for
   backtracking usually associated with logic programming, and supports a
   pattern-matching method of building functions based on Prolog
   notation.  The Lisp code generated from SEQUEL functions is completely
   portable and runs in most Common Lisp implementations. It is
   comparable in efficiency with hand-written code.  SEQUEL also supports
   optional static type-checking in the manner of SML and similar
   languages.  With type-checking enabled, all inputs and loaded files
   are type-checked and the resulting Lisp programs are type-secure.  The
   SEQUEL compiler uses the information gleaned from type-checking to add
   compiler directives within the generated Lisp functions to produce
   optimized Lisp programs.  SEQUEL includes a UNIX-style top level with
   its own trace package and type-checking debugger. SEQUEL is also of
   interest to automated reasoning researchers. It provides a very
   powerful means of generating proof assistants and theorem provers that
   have a very fast performance using WAM-derived compilation techniques.
   The theorem provers are automatically verified. It includes a facility
   for Datalog and an efficient occurs-check Horn-clause-to-Lisp
   compiler, a mouse driven graphical interface for all proof assistants
   and theorem provers built under SEQUEL (currently available only under
   Lucid).  Several demonstration theorem provers for different logics,
   including FOL, Clarke's logic of space, partial evaluation, set
   theory, and constructive type theory are available.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/src_cmp/ilisp/

Name:         COMPARE

Summary:      InterLisp Source Comparison Tool

Version:      15-APR-88

Description: 

   COMPARESOURCES is an Interlisp program for comparing two versions of a Lisp
   source file for differences.  The comparison is completely
   brute-force: COMPARESOURCES reads the complete contents of both files,
   and compares all the expressions for differences.  

   Note that this code is very much dependent on Interlisp, since it uses
   the DWIMIFY function for cleaning up the functions before comparison.
   On the other hand, it does provide a Lispish form-by-form comparison
   that avoids differences in indentation. So it might be useful to
   port this code to Common Lisp someday. In its current form, it really
   isn't usable.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/src_cmp/mkant/

Name:         Source Compare (SC)

Summary:      A 'diff' program for Common Lisp

Version:      24-JAN-91

Description: 

   Source Compare is a portable tool for comparing Common Lisp source
   files, similar to the UNIX program 'diff'. Like diff it can ignore
   case, whitespace, and blank lines. In addition, it can also ignore
   certain classes of Lisp comments. It uses a greedy algorithm that runs
   in average-case O(m+n) time.

Version:      5-JAN-93

Description: 

   The Automatic User Manual Creation system is a portable system for
   automatically generating user's guides from the source definitions and
   their documentation strings. It uses several heuristics for formatting
   the documentation segments nicely. It can produce text (ASCII),
   Scribe, and LaTeX output.  If Waters' XP pretty printer is available,
   it uses that instead to format the argument lists.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/code/tools/xref/

Name:         XREF

Summary:      Static analysis cross-referencing tool for Common Lisp.

Version:      27-FEB-91

Description: 

   XREF is a portable static analysis cross referencing tool for Common
   Lisp. It determines the callers of functions and variables and is
   useful for mapping out the structure of a program. XREF is similar to
   the Symbolics Who-Calls and Xerox Masterscope programs. It includes an
   interface to Joe Bates' PostScript graphing tool (psgraph.lisp).

   When you change a function or variable definition, it can be useful to
   know its callers, in order to update each of them to the new
   definition. Similarly, having a graphic display of the structure
   (e.g., call graph) of a program can help make undocumented code more
   understandable. This static code analyzer facilitates both
   capabilities.  The database compiled by xref is suitable for viewing
   by a graphical browser. (Note: the reference graph is not necessarily
   a DAG. Since many graphical browsers assume a DAG, this will lead to
   infinite loops.  Some code which is useful in working around this
   problem is included, as well as a sample text-indenting outliner and
   an interface to Bates' PSGraph PostScript Graphing facility.)

   and Harlequin.  It is intended to be a portable successor of Symbolics
   UIMS (Dynamic Windows, Presentations Types).  CLIM 2.0 also supports
   more traditional toolkit-style programming. CLIM includes a general
   purpose grapher.  It runs on Symbolics Lisp Machines; Allegro, Lucid,
   and Harlequin on several Unix platforms; Symbolics CLOE on 386/486 IBM
   PCs running Windows; and MCL on Apple Macintoshes.  With the exception
   of Macintoshes, if it is available it can be purchased from the vendor
   of the Lisp system you are using.  For the Macintosh version write to
   Illudium: Dennis Doughty <Doughty@ileaf.com> or Bill York <york@lucid.com>.
   Illidium has signed a distribution agreement for MCL CLIM with
   Lucid, so you can also get it from Lucid at sales@lucid.com,
   415-329-8400. (Lucid also has a license to distribute MCL itself.)

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clim/clib/

Name:         CLIB

Summary:      CLIM Interface Builder

Version:      

Description: 

   Prototype implementation of CLIB, the CLIM Interface Builder.  CLIB
   allows the programmer to generate code for CLIM (the Common Lisp
   Interface Manager) interactively. This speeds up the development
   process and reduces the possibility of errors. This kind of
   interactive rapid prototyping can significantly reduce the costs of a
   specification phase.

   A prototype of a CLIM Interface Builder is being developed within a joint
   effort of Forschungszentrum Informatik (FZI) and Symbolics Systemhaus GmbH.

   Contents include a postscript tech report describing the
   preliminary version of CLIB, and binaries for the Allegro implementation.

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clm/

Name:         CLM, GINA, and IB

Summary:      Common Lisp Motif, Generic INteractive Application, and
              Interface Builder

Version:      2.2, 11-NOV-92

Description: 

   CLM (Common Lisp Motif) runs OSF/Motif widgets in a separate C process,
   with minimal work on the Lisp side and communicates between C and Lisp
   using TCP sockets. When CLX is loaded before compiling CLM, client
   programs can also use the CLX graphics functions to draw into Motif
   widgets, especially into widgets of classes XmDrawingArea and
   XmDrawnButton. 

   GINA (Generic INteractive Application) is an application framework
   based on Common Lisp and OSF/Motif to simplify the construction of
   graphical interactive applications. It is a class library
   implemented in CLOS.

   IB (Interface Builder) is an interactive tool implemented with GINA
   to design Motif windows. It generates Lisp code to be used with GINA.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clue/

Name:         CLUE and CLIO

Summary:      Common Lisp User-Interface Environment and
              Common Lisp Interactive Objects

Version:      7-1 (24-JAN-90), 7-20 (31-JUL-90)

Description: 

   CLUE (Common Lisp User-Interface Environment) is from TI, and extends CLX
   to provide a simple, object-oriented toolkit (like Xt) library that uses
   CLOS. Provides basic window classes, some stream I/O facilities, and a few
   other utilities. Still pretty low level (it's a toolkit, not widget
   library). Examples include a simple pop-up menu.

   CLIO (Common Lisp Interactive Objects) is a GUI from the people who created
   CLUE. It provides a set of CLOS classes that represent the standard
   components of an object-oriented user interface -- such as text, menus,
   buttons, scroller, and dialogs.  It is included as part of the CLUE
   distribution, along with some packages that use it, both sample and real.

   PICTURES is an object-oriented graphics package built on CLX, CLUE,
   and CLOS. It provides a set of classes for creating, transforming, and
   interacting with hierarchical structures of 2D graphical primitives.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/clx/

Name:         CLX

Summary:      Common Lisp X binding

Version:      R6 (17-APR-94); R5.02 (3-SEP-92)

Description: 

   CLX provides basic Common Lisp/X functionality. It is a de facto standard
   low-level interface to X, providing equivalent functionality to XLib, but
   in Lisp. It is also a good source for comparing the foreign function calls
   in various Lisps. It does *not* depend on CLOS.  

   [Note: The R6 version is clearly different from the R5 version, and
   it is distributed with X11R6, so we're just going to assume that it
   is indeed the R6 version of CLX.]

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/garnet/

Name:         GARNET

Summary:      One of the biggest and best GUIs for Lisp.

Version:      2.2 (15-OCT-93)

Description: 

   Garnet is a large and flexible GUI that includes lots of high-level
   features.  It does *not* depend on CLOS, but uses its own custom
   object system (called KR) instead. Garnet (version 2.0 and after)
   is now in the public domain, and has no licensing restrictions, so
   it is available to all foreign sites and for commercial uses.

   Garnet includes the Lapidiary interactive design tool, C32 constraint
   editor, spreadsheet object, Gilt Interface Builder, automatic display
   management, two widget sets (Motif look-and-feel and Garnet
   look-and-feel), support for gesture recognition, and automatic
   constraint maintenance, application data layout and PostScript
   generation.

   Garnet helps implement highly-interactive, graphical, direct
   manipulation programs for X11 in Common Lisp.  Typical applications
   include: drawing programs similar to Macintosh MacDraw, user interfaces
   for expert systems and other AI applications, box and arrow diagram
   editors, graphical programming languages, game user interfaces,
   simulation and process monitoring programs, user interface construction
   tools, CAD/CAM programs, etc.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/graphers/

Name:         Graphers

Summary:      Simple grapher that runs in most of the GUIs

Version:      11-MAR-91

Description: 

   This directory contains a simple grapher like the one described in
   "Lisp Lore" by Bromeley and Lamson. It has versions for most of the
   GUI toolkits.  Several implementations have a mouse sensitivity
   feature and others have implementation-specific features.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/lispview/

Name:         LispView

Summary:      A GUI that doesn't use CLX.

Version:      1.1 (8-NOV-91); Fixes 13-JAN-92

Description: 

   LispView is a GUI written at Sun that does not use CLX.  Instead it
   converts Xlib.h directly into Lucid foreign function calls. It is
   intended to be fast and tight. LispView includes a general-purpose 2D
   grapher library, an interface to Sun's XGL 2.0 3D graphics library,
   and a generic scrollable list package.

   In addition to the usual X-Windows output functions for windows,
   LispView supports a sophisticated input model for handling events.

   LispView can also translate an interface developed with the OpenWindows(TM)
   Developers' Guide (Devguide) Interface Builder.

   The manual is in the doc/ subdirectory in PostScript (ps.tar.gz)
   or FrameMaker (frame.tar.gz) formats.

   The source code is in source.tar.gz and includes the generic source
   interface to the XView(TM) 2.0 libraries. The XView 2.0 libraries
   (with a patched libolgx) are in xview-libs.tar.gz. A LispView module
   built from the sources can be found in lispview-user.tar.gz. Demos,
   translators to/from Devguide, and some test files can be found in
   guide-etc.tar.gz. Utilities are in util.tar.gz.

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/lispwork/

Name:         

Summary:      Information about Lispworks Toolkit

Version:      

Description: 

   The LispWorks Toolkit is an extensible CLOS-based widget set that uses
   CLX and CLUE. The LispWorks programming environment has been written
   using the toolkit and includes: an Emacs-like editor, listener,
   debugger, profiler, and operating system shell; browsers/graphers for
   classes, generic functions, processes, windows, files, compilation
   errors, source code systems, and setting LispWorks parameters; and an
   interactive interface builder and complete online hypertext
   documentation. 

   (Since this is part of LispWorks, it isn't free. Send mail to the
   contact address below for more information.)

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/lsp2wish/

Name:         LISP2WISH

Summary:      Simple demo of synchronous communication between Lisp
              and Tcl/Tk

Version:      6 (13-JUL-94)

Description: 

   LISP2WISH is a very simple demonstration of how to connect and
   communicate SYNCHRONOUSLY between a lisp process and a C process
   running a Tcl/Tk executable.  The demo uses the vanilla 'wish'
   executable that is included with the Tcl/Tk distribution.  

   Tcl/Tk is a very flexible system for building Graphical User
   Interfaces (GUIs), with the look-and-feel of Motif.  One writes
   scripts in a high-level, C-like language, and an interpreter evaluates
   the commands and passes execution either to a built-in function (and
   there are many), or to your own C routines.  Tcl/Tk is becoming
   increasingly popular because of its ease of use, and because it is
   freely distributable (even commercially, I believe).  For more
   information on Tcl/Tk, look on the USENET newsgroup comp.lang.tcl, or
   get the distribution from the archive (listed below) or
   ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.  The Tcl/Tk archive also has many
   user-contributed extensions which make Tcl/Tk even more desirable.
   Tcl/Tk was originally written by Dr. John Ousterhout, at Berkeley.

   LISP2WISH lets you make a window/menu/drawing interface for your lisp
   routines, where you can take advantage of all the stuff written for
   Tcl/Tk (and build your own!).

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/winterp/

Name:         WINTERP

Summary:      Widget INTERPreter

Version:      2.02 (14-JUN-94)

Description: 

   WINTERP (Widget INTERPreter) is an application development environment
   developed at HP. It enables the rapid prototyping of graphical
   user-interfaces through direct manipulation of user interface objects
   and their attached actions.  WINTERP provides an interface to the X11
   toolkit (Xt) and the OSF/Motif widget set and a built-in RPC mechanism
   for inter-application communication.  It includes an object-oriented
   2.5D graphics and animation widget based on the Xtango path transition
   animation system, the XmGraph graph browser (with graph nodes as
   arbitrary WINTERP widgets), and GIF image support.  The interpreter is
   based on David Betz's XLISP interpreter, which implements a small
   subset of Common Lisp and runs on PCs, Decstation 3100s, HP9000s,
   Sun3, Sparcs, SGI, and NeXT.  XLISP provides a simple Smalltalk-like
   object system, with OSF/Motif widgets as real XLISP objects -- they
   can be specialized via subclassing, methods added or altered, etc.
   WINTERP includes an interface to GNU-Emacs which allows code to be
   developed and tested without leaving the editor.  WINTERP is a
   free-standing Lisp-based tool for setting up window applications.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/xit/

Name:         XIT

Summary:      X User Interface Toolkit

Version:      5.9.4 (21-JUL-93)

Description: 

   XIT (X User Interface Toolkit) is an object-oriented user interface
   development environment for the X Window System based on Common Lisp,
   CLOS, CLX, and CLUE.  It has been developed by the Research Group
   DRUID at the Department of Computer Science of the University of
   Stuttgart (druid@informatik.uni-stuttgart.de) as a framework for
   Common Lisp/CLOS applications with graphical user interfaces for the X
   Window System.  XIT contains user interface toolkits, including
   general building blocks and mechanisms for building arbitrary user
   interface elements and a set of predefined common elements (widgets),
   as well as high-level interactive tools for constructing, inspecting,
   and modifying user interfaces by means of direct manipulation.
   Although the system kernel is quite stable, XIT is still under active
   development.  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/gui/xwin/

Name:         XWIN

Summary:      Simple X windows for text output from LISP

Version:      30-DEC-91

Description: 

   XWIN is a simple hack for getting X-window text output from a LISP
   program. Rather than be tied into a LISP graphics package, it uses a
   shellscript to do the windows stuff, and drives the shell script from
   Lisp. This makes refresh run quite quickly.

   The code is short -- a page or two of Lisp code including comments --
   but lets you manage several X windows by name.

   On the LISP end the program refers to the X windows by name (a symbol
   or other EQ-able object).  It would have been even easier to just pass
   back the streams and let the program output to them directly, but that
   would require that the program pass them around or store them globally
   somewhere.  It also puts the need to do FORCE-OUTPUTs in the hands of
   the main program.  So XWIN lets the interface to maintain the list of
   streams.

   Included in this directory is a copy of the Allegro CL FAQ dated 7/28/93.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/alsp/

Name:         

Summary:      Lisp-like data structures for ADA

Version:      1.0 (17-MAR-86)

Description: 

   ALSP is a package of types, objects, and functions that emulate the
   important capabilities of Lisp which are not directly available in
   Ada. These capabilities are represented in Ada in a relatively
   straightforward manner without changing the Ada language definition.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/awk/

Name:         AWK Lisp

Summary:      Lisp implemented in AWK

Version:      23-JUL-90

Description: 

   A Lisp interpreter implemented in Awk.

   It provides intrinsic versions of the basic functions on
   s-expressions, and many others written in LISP.

   The interpreter has thirteen built-in functions: car, cdr, cons, eq,
   atom, set, eval, error, quote, cond, and, or, list.  These include the
   five elementary functions on s-expressions defined by McCarthy; some
   conditional expression operators; an assignment operator, and some
   functions to control the evaluation process.

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/bbn/

Name:         BBN

Summary:      BBN Butterfly Common Lisp and BBN Butterfly Scheme

Version:      2.00 (6-APR-90); 4-FEB-93

Description: 

   This directory contains the sources and binaries for BBN Butterfly
   Common Lisp and BBN Butterfly Scheme.  These programs have been
   publicly released by BBN for the use of the programming community.
   This software is unlikely to run on any machine other than the
   butterfly without significant work; but it might make a good starting
   point for a free implementation of Common Lisp.

   The file "bbn-cl.tv" is a listing of the tar file's contents.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/clicc/

Name:         CLiCC

Summary:      Common Lisp to C Compiler

Version:      0.6.4 (23-JUN-94); 0.6.2 (3-JAN-94); 0.6.1 (30-JUL-93)

Description: 

   CLiCC (Common Lisp to C Compiler) generates C-executables from Common
   Lisp application programs. CLiCC is not a Common Lisp system, and
   hence does not include any program development or debugging support.
   CLiCC is intended to be used as an add-on to existing Common Lisp
   systems for generating portable applications. CLiCC (version 0.6.2)
   can now compile itself to get a standalone compiler that may be used
   without a Lisp system. CLiCC supports CL_0, a subset of Common Lisp +
   CLOS, which excludes EVAL and related functions. At present CL_0 is
   based on CLtL1, but is headed towards CLtL2 and ANSI-CL. The generated
   C code (ANSI-C or K&R-C compatible) may be compiled using a
   conventional C compiler on the target machine, and must be linked with
   the CLiCC runtime library in order to generate executables. CLiCC
   has a foreign function interface.

   The generated C code is not readable in the sense of hand written C
   code. It results from a direct translation of abstract machine code
   to corresponding C constructs.

   The file CL0.ps.gz contains the report documenting the CommonLisp0
   and CLOS0 language (translated from German to English).

   The authors welcome suggestions and improvements and would appreciate
   receiving email even if you just used CLiCC successfully.

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/clisp/

Name:         CLISP

Summary:      Common Lisp implementation from Germany

Version:      1993-11-08

Description: 

   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1 + parts of CLtL2) implementation by
   Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich
   University, both in Germany. It runs on microcomputers as well as
   on Unix workstations and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM.  

   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler, a subset of CLOS and, for some
   machines, a screen editor. Packages running in CLISP include PCL and,
   on Unix machines, CLX and Garnet.  

   The structure of the distribution is as follows:
      source/            source of CLISP
      binaries/          binaries for several platforms
      packages/          application packages ported to CLISP:
                            PCL (another CLOS subset), CLX, Garnet, and Maxima.
      mail/              archives of the mailing list

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/cmucl/

Name:         CMU CL

Summary:      CMU Common Lisp

Version:      17e (11-MAR-94); 17c (19-SEP-93) 

Description: 

   CMU Common Lisp (CMU CL) is a high quality public domain Lisp system.
   It includes an incremental compiler, Hemlock emacs-style editor,
   source-code level debugger, code profiler and is mostly X3J13
   compatible, including the new loop macro.

   The new CMU CL compiler (Python) is more sophisticated than other
   Common Lisp compilers. It both produces better code and is easier to
   use. Python does many optimizations that are absent or less general in
   other Common Lisp compilers, and is particularly good at number
   crunching.

   See SUPPORT for important information regarding the support status of
   CMU CL. (In short, the CMU CL project is no longer funded by Arpa,
   so future support will be minimal. They'll fix bugs, especially
   those that affect the use of CMU CL as a cross-development vehicle
   for their Dylan work, but they won't be adding any major new features.
   Continuing the same level of support is not an option without ARPA
   or industrial financial support.)

Summary:      Compiles Lisp into C

Version:      0.12 (3-JUL-94); 0.11 (29-JUN-94); 0.10 (22-NOV-93)

Description: 

   ECoLisp (ECL, Eco Common Lisp) is a Common Lisp implementation which
   compiles Lisp functions into C functions that use the C stack and
   standard procedure call conventions. This lets Lisp and C code be
   easily mixed. It is designed to be used as a C library from any C
   application. ECL also includes MTCL, a multithread facility, and CLOS.

   This is an alpha release.

   The sources are in ecl.tar.gz. The compiler requires that the file
   dcl.h be present under /usr/local/include/.

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/gcl/

Name:         GCL

Summary:      GNU Common Lisp

Version:      1.0 (10-MAY-94)

Description: 

   GNU Common Lisp (GCL) is a highly portable implementation of
   Common Lisp originally based on Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL), a
   Common Lisp (CLtL1) implementation developed at Kyoto University in
   Japan and extended by Bill Schelter of UT/Austin. GCL is intended
   to eventually support the ANSI Standard for Common Lisp. GCL
   generates C code which it compiles with the local optimizing C
   compiler (e.g., GCC).

   GCL has a source level debugger for interpreted code, profiling
   tools based on the C profiling tools, and supports CLX, and PCL.

   Versions 1.0 and above of GCL (aka versions 1-625 and above of
   AKCL) no longer require the kcl.tar file, and are covered by the
   GNU General Public Library License. 

   Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
   11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax
   512-258-1342, E-mail guthery@acw.com, including a CLOS for AKCL. 

   Ibuki Common Lisp is a commercialized and improved version of Kyoto
   Common Lisp. It runs on over 30 platforms, including Sun3, Sparc, Dec
   (Ultrix), Apollo, HP 9000, IBM RS/6000, Silicon Graphics and IBM PCs.
   It includes an incremental compiler, interpreter, foreign function
   interface. It generates C code from the Lisp and compiles it using the
   local C compiler.  Image size is about 3mb. Cost is $2800

Summary:      Kyoto Common Lisp

Version:      KCL (10-JUN-87); AKCL 1-615 (28-APR-92)

Description: 

   Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is a highly portable and implementation of
   Common Lisp originally developed at Kyoto University in Japan. KCL
   conforms to CLtL1.  Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) is a collection of
   ports, bug fixes and improvements to KCL written by Bill Schelter.
   {A}KCL generates C code which it compiles with the local C compiler.

   It is recommended that you use AKCL and not try to compile KCL, since
   KCL is unlikely to work with current operating systems.

   Commercial versions of {A}KCL are available from Austin Code Works,
   11100 Leafwood Lane, Austin, TX 78750-3409, Tel. 512-258-0785, Fax

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/pearl/

Name:         Pearl

Summary:      Information about Pearl Lisp

Version:      

Description: 

   When Apple Computer acquired Coral Software in January 1989, they
   re-released Coral's Allegro Common Lisp and its optional modules as
   Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp (now just Macintosh Common Lisp).
   Coral's other product, Pearl Lisp, was discontinued at that time.
   Pearl Lisp provides a subset of the functionality of MACL 1.3 and is
   not even fully CLtL1-compatible (e.g., the implementation of defstruct is
   different).

   Despite rumors to the contrary, Pearl Lisp is not and never was public
   domain. Nevertheless, Pearl Lisp and its documentation were placed in
   the "Moof:Goodies:Pearl Lisp" folder on the first pressing of "Phil
   and Dave's Excellent CD", the precursor to the current Apple
   Developer's CD-ROM series.  Apple removed Pearl from later versions of
   the developer CD-ROM distribution because of complaints from other
   Lisp vendors. If you own a copy of Pearl Lisp or a copy of this
   CD-ROM, you can make it runnable under System 7 with some slight
   modifications using ResEdit.  To repeat, Pearl Lisp is NOT public
   domain, so you must own a copy to use it.

   To make it runnable, one needs to use ResEdit to make changes to the
   BNDL and FREF resources so that it will connect to its icons properly.
   This will make it respond to double-clicks in the normal manner and
   make it be properly linked to its files.

   Detailed instructions for modifying Pearl Lisp using ResEdit 
   are included in this directory.

   After you've made the changes, it will run under System 7 on 68000s
   and 68030s if you turn off 32-bit addressing. It seems to bomb on a
   Quadra.      

   If you need a more powerful Lisp or one that is compatible with the
   standard for Common Lisp, consider purchasing Macintosh Common Lisp.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/powerlsp/

Name:         PowerLisp

Summary:      Shareware Common Lisp for the Macintosh

Version:      1.10 () ; 1.01 (6-SEP-93)

Description: 

   PowerLisp is a Common Lisp development environment for the Macintosh.
   It consists of a Common Lisp interpreter, native-code 680x0 compiler,
   680x0 macro assembler, disassembler, incremental linker and
   multi-window text editor. 

   PowerLisp has the ability to run in the background. While executing a
   Common Lisp program, the user may switch to another application as it
   continues to run. You can also edit programs while a Common Lisp
   program is running.

   PowerLisp is targeted to be compatible with CTLTL2 without CLOS
   (for now) but some Common Lisp functions are not yet implemented.
   Upcoming versions should include the remaining language features.

   Documentation in Word and MacWrite format and sample programs/source
   included. 

   The file is encoded with BinHex4.0 and StuffIt 3.07.

Package:      lang/lisp/impl/reflisp/

Name:         RefLisp

Summary:      Reference-counting Lisp Interpreter

Version:      2.67 (27-FEB-93)

Description: 

   RefLisp is a small Lisp interpreter. Versions exist for MS-DOS and
   UNIX (AIX). The MS-DOS version supports CGA/EGA/VGA graphics and the
   Microsoft Mouse. The interpreter is a shallow-binding (i.e.,
   everything has dynamic scope), reference counting design making it
   suitable for experimenting with real-time and graphic user interface
   programming. Common Lisp compatibility macros are provided, and most
   of the examples in "Lisp" by Winston & Horn have been run on RefLisp.
   RefLisp makes no distinction between symbol-values and
   function-values, so a symbol can be either but not both.  RefLisp
   comes with an ASCII manual and many demonstration programs, including
   an analogue clock which never stops for garbage collection.  There is
   also a program profiler.

Description: 

   The "CM5 *Lisp tutorial" in Andrew "ez" and PostScript formats.
   It is aimed at students who don't have an earlier exposure to Lisp.

   *Lisp examples used in the tutorial are a simple Laplace solver combined
   with *Graphics, and a somewhat more complicated Particle in Cell code. 
   The latter is based on using segmented scans and the router rather than 
   on NEWS operations.

Description: 

   WCL is an implementation of Common Lisp for Sparc based workstations. WCL
   provides a large subset of Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that
   can be linked with Lisp and C code to produce efficient and small
   applications. For example, the executable for a Lisp version of the
   canonical ``Hello World!'' program requires only 40k bytes under
   SunOS 4.1 for SPARC. WCL provides CLX R5 as a shared library, and
   comes with PCL and a few other utilities.

Package:      lang/lisp/oop/clos/pcl/

Name:         PCL

Summary:      Portable implementation of CLOS.

Version:      JUL-92-1d, 16-SEP-92-f

Description: 

   CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) is the object-oriented programming
   standard for Common Lisp. It is the successor to Symbolics FLAVORS and
   Xerox LOOPS (Lisp Object Oriented Programming System). The acronym
   CLOS is pronouned either as "See-Loss" or "Closs", depending on taste.

   PCL (Portable Common Loops) is a portable CLOS implementation. It
   is not complete, but the differences won't affect most users. A key
   difference is PCL doesn't support the :METHOD option to DEFGENERIC. 
   We've included a file called pclfixes.cl (originally
   ags/prog/pcl-fixes.lisp) from the KEIM theorem prover that adds
   this capability.

   Most Common Lisp implementations now include their own CLOS
   implementations. Common Lisp implementations with native CLOS include:
   MCL, {A}KCL, Allegro CL (including Allegro CL\PC), Ibuki, Lucid,
   Medley, Symbolics Genera, CLOE, Harlequin Lispworks, and CLISP (SEP-93
   or newer).  CMU CL uses a customized version of PCL as their CLOS.
   However, not all native CLOS implementations have as detailed a
   meta-object protocol as PCL. For example, MCL 2.0 users sometimes use
   the july-1d version of PCL instead of the native CLOS for precisely
   this reason.

Summary:      Implementation of HP's CommonObjects on top of the PCL
              metaclass kernel.

Version:      10-MAY-87

Description: 

   COOL is an implementation of HP's CommonObjects on the Portable
   CommonLoops (PCL) metaclass kernel.  As such, it provides a portable
   implementation of CommonObjects. It should be of particular interest
   to people who want to program in the mixin style supported by PCL but
   are also interested in trying the encapsulation style of Smalltalk,
   which CommonObjects supports.

   This version of COOL is guaranteed to work with Portable CommonLoops
   system date 2-24-87. A copy of this version of Portable CommonLoops is
   distributed along with COOL.

Package:      lang/lisp/oop/non_clos/corbit/

Name:         CORBIT and BOOPS

Summary:      Object-oriented extension of Common Lisp based on a
              prototype (classless) model of OOP.

Version:      21-JAN-93

Description: 

   CommonORBIT (also called CORBIT) is an object-oriented extension of
   Common Lisp.  It uses a prototype (classless) model of OOP, is easy to
   use and yet has many sophisticated features found also in KL-ONE type
   languages.  CommonORBIT is a Common Lisp reimplementation of ORBIT,
   which was originally conceived by Luc Steels around 1981-1983.
   Because of its delegation-based rather than class-based inheritance,
   CommonORBIT offers extreme flexibility to define and change
   practically anything at run-time.  Because of the generic functions,
   it fits well into regular Lisp code.  It can co-exist with CLOS but
   remains completely separate. 

   BOOPS (Beginner's Object-Oriented Programming System) is a
   stripped-down version of CORBIT.  It is very small,
   efficient and simple and intended for classroom use.

   Documentation (postscript, MSWord, Ascii) is included.

Summary:      Meta Class System, a portable object-oriented extension 
              to Common Lisp.

Version:      1.3.1 (13-MAY-91); 1.4.1 (16-NOV-92)

Description: 

   MCS (Meta Class System) is a portable object-oriented extension to
   Common Lisp. It integrates the functionality of CLOS (the Common Lisp
   Object System), and TELOS, (the object system of LeLisp Version 16 and
   EuLisp).  MCS provides a metaobject protocol which the user can
   specialize.

   MCS has been used successfully for the development of the commercial
   software product Babylon, an expert system development workbench that
   includes a hybrid knowledge representation language and many tools
   like editors and browsers.

   If you use MCS, send Juergen a short email message, so that you
   will be notified when updates are available.

Package:      lang/lisp/util/emacs/cl_shell/

Name:         CL Shell

Summary:      Running Common Lisp as an Emacs subprocess.

Version:      18-OCT-93

Description: 

   The cl-shell package provides a major mode (cl-shell-mode) for running
   Common Lisp (CL) as an Emacs subprocess.  It provides a general
   mechanism for communication between CL and Emacs which does not rely
   on extra processes, and should therefore be easily portable to any
   version of CL.  Features include direct (i.e., not through a temp file)
   evaluation and in-package compilation of forms from lisp-mode buffers,
   type-ahead and a history mechanism for the cl-shell buffer, and pop-up
   help facilities for the CL functions documentation, macroexpand and
   describe.  Extensions for Lucid Common Lisp provide pop-up arglists
   and source file editing.  Other extensions are provided to allow
   editing source files of CLOS or Flavors methods.

Topic:        lang/others/dylan/

Name:         Dylan

Summary:      Apple's new Object-Oriented Dynamic Language.

Description:

   Dylan is a new Object-Oriented Dynamic Language (OODL), based on
   Scheme, CLOS, and Smalltalk. The purpose of the language is to retain
   the benefits of OODLs and also allow efficient application delivery.
   The design stressed keeping Dylan small and consistent, while
   allowing a high degree of expressiveness. Dylan is consistently
   object-oriented; it is not a procedural language with an
   object-oriented extension.

   A manual/specification for the language is available from Apple
   Computer.  Send email to dylan-manual-request@cambridge.apple.com or
   write to Apple Computer, 1 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142.  Include
   your complete address and also a phone number (the phone number is
   especially important for anyone outside the US).

   Apple hasn't announced plans to release Dylan as a product.

Summary:      Interpreter for a Dylan-like language.

Version:      0.4 (13-JUL-94)

Description: 

   Marlais is a simple interpreter for a language strongly resembling
   Dylan. It is not intended as a final release, but rather
   to fill a perceived void where Dylan implementations are concerned.
   This is a "hackers release" and is intended as a vehicle for
   education, experimentation and also to encourage people to port it to
   different architectures, add features, and fix bugs.  Marlais is alpha
   software and should not be used by people desiring reliability!!!

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/others/dylan/impl/mindy/

Name:         Mindy

Summary:      Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet 

Version:      1.0 (30-JUN-94)

Description: 

   Mindy (Mindy Is Not Dylan Yet) is a Dylan-like language. Mindy is
   incomplete, in that it does not implement everything in the Dylan
   Interim Reference Manual (DIRM) and the DIRM itself is yet
   incomplete. But Mindy does implement most of what the authors feel
   Dylan will be.

   Mindy was developed by the Gwydion Project at Carnegie Mellon
   University for internal use as a development tool while work on the
   "real" high-performance Dylan implementation progresses. Mindy has
   been made available as a courtesy to people who want to learn about Dylan.
   However, the amount of effort that will be put into maintaining Mindy
   is strictly limited, since Mindy isn't intended to be an industrial
   strength implementation.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/others/dylan/impl/thomas/

Name:         Thomas

Summary:      Compiler for a Dylan-like language.

Version:      1.1 (25-SEP-92)

Description: 

   Thomas is a compiler for a language that is compatible with the
   language described in the book "Dylan(TM) an object-oriented dynamic
   language" by Apple Computer Eastern Research and Technology, April
   1992. Thomas was written at Digital Equipment Corporation's Cambridge
   Research Laboratory. Thomas is NOT Dylan(TM) and was built with no
   direct input, aid, assistance or discussion with Apple.

   The Thomas system is written in Scheme and generates IEEE
   compatible Scheme code. 

   DEC CRL's goals in building Thomas were to learn about Dylan by
   building an implementation, and to build a system they could use to
   write small Dylan programs. As such, Thomas has no optimizations of
   any kind and does not perform well.

Package:      lang/others/eulisp/eu2c/

Name:         Apply/Eu2C

Summary:      EuLisp->C compiler

Version:      94-02 (9-FEB-94)

Description: 

   Apply/Eu2C is an EuLisp->C compiler available from ISST.  Eu2C runs on
   top of Franz Allegro CL 4.1 and compiles EuLisp-Modules into C source
   code which then must be compiled by an ANSI C-compiler (currently only
   GCC is supported).  The Eu2C implementation provides EuLisp 0.99
   level-0, with the exception of concurrency. Future versions of Eu2C
   will include a C interface and straight module compilation. 

   The development of Apply/Eu2C was supported by the German Federal
   Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) within the joint project
   APPLY. The partners of this project are the Christian Albrechts
   University Kiel, the Fraunhofer Institute for Software Engineering and
   Systems Engineering (ISST), the German National Research Center for
   Computer Science(GMD), and VW-Gedas.

   The main goal of APPLY project is to develop a Lisp system which
   consistently supports the efficient execution of applications and
   simplifies their integration into current software environments.
   Towards that end, ISST is investigating strategies for the compilation
   of EuLisp-Modules into efficient stand-alone C-Programs. The Eu2C
   compiler is the first step along this path.

Description: 

   Feel (Free and Eventually Eulisp) is an initial implementation of the
   EuLisp language from the University of Bath, UK.  EuLisp is sort of
   like an extended Scheme. It includes an integrated object system, a
   module system, and support for parallelism. Feel is partly a C-based
   interpreter and partly a bytecode interpreter/compiler.  An
   out-of-core compiler system is also available.  The distribution
   includes an interface to the PVM library, support for TCP/IP sockets,
   and libraries for futures, Linda, and CSP.

   This directory contains the EuLisp language definition, the Feel
   implementation, and implementations of the EuLisp object system

Package:      lang/others/ml/caml_lt/

Name:         Caml Light

Summary:      Small, portable implementation of the ML language

Version:      0.6 (1-SEP-93)

Description: 

  Caml Light is a small, portable implementation of the ML language.

  Caml Light implements the Caml language, a functional language from
  the ML family. Caml is quite close to Standard ML, though not strictly
  conformant. There are some slight differences in syntax and semantics,
  and major differences in the module system (these changes were
  required to support separate compilation).

  Caml Light is implemented as a bytecode compiler, and fully
  bootstraped.  The runtime system and bytecode interpreter is written
  in standard C, hence Caml Light is easy to port to almost any 32-bit
  platform. The whole system is quite small: about 100K for the runtime
  system, and another 100K of bytecode for the compiler. 1.2 megabyte of
  memory is enough to recompile the whole system. This stands in sharp
  contrast with other implementations of ML, such as SML-NJ, that
  requires about ten times more memory. Performance is quite good for a
  bytecoded implementation: five to ten times slower than SML-NJ.

  Caml Light comes in two flavors: a classical, interactive, toplevel-based
  system; and a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces standalone
  programs, in the spirit of the Unix cc compiler. The former is good for
  learning the language and testing programs. The latter integrates more
  smoothly within programming environments. The generated programs are quite
  small, and can be used like any other command.

Package:      lang/others/ml/sml_nj/

Name:         Standard ML of New Jersey

Summary:      Free implementation of the Standard ML language.

Version:      SML-NJ 0.93 (16-FEB-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains Standard ML of New Jersey, version 0.93. It
   is the first general public release since version 0.75. 

   The release features support for several new machines (i386, rs6000,
   hppa), less space taken up by compilation and execution, extensive
   documentation, and almost no remaining bugs.

   It includes an extensive library of structures and functions with
   detailed documentation (The Standard ML of New Jersey Library), a
   system for multithreaded concurrent programming in an extension of
   Standard ML with synchronous communication channels (the Concurrent ML
   system, CML), and an elegant concurrent interface to the X Window
   System (eXene).  The eXene system is built on top of Concurrent ML.

   The release also includes several tools written in SML: a separate
   compilation and "make" facility (SourceGroup), a lexical analyzer
   generator (lexgen), a LALR(1) parser generator (mlyacc), a dynamic
   tree pattern matching code generator generator (mltwig), a rudimentary
   tool for querying the SML environment (info), a debugger, and a profiler.

Summary:      CMU Prolog Repository

Description:

   Welcome to the Prolog Repository.

   The Prolog Repository is part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence
   Repository. The goal of the Prolog Repository is to collect files and
   programs of general interest to Prolog programmers. Information
   files include the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) postings for the
   comp.lang.prolog newsgroup and copies of the draft standard for prolog.

   If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
   this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
   important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
   of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
   signify your agreement to these conditions.

   To contribute files to the repository, first see section [7] of the
   readme.txt file. Then send mail to AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu. If
   possible, please put the files in ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/new/.

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/lang/prolog/  [128.2.206.173]
              Give "anonymous" (without the quotes) at the username:
              prompt and type your email address (in the form "user@host")
              at the password: prompt. NOTE: There is *no* leading slash
              before user/ai/lang/prolog/; just type "cd user/ai/lang/prolog/"
              at the ftp> prompt.

              If you will be transferring compressed files, be sure to
              type the "binary" command before retrieving the files. The
              "get" command is used to get a single file, and "mget" to
              retrieve multiple files using wildcards.  If you're using
              the "mget" command, you might want to turn off prompting
              first by using the "prompt" command.

              The Prolog Repository is kept in the Andrew File System (AFS)
              directory
              /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/prolog/
              and its subdirectories. If your site runs AFS, you can
              just cd to this directory and copy the files directly.
              (The FTP location given above is just a link to the AFS
              directory.)

              Further information about AFS can be obtained by
              sending email to afs-sales@transarc.com.

Summary:      Prolog Benchmarking Suites

Version:      

Description: 

   This directory contains code for benchmarking Prolog implementation
   compatibility and performance.

   Naive reverse is the classical benchmark for computing LIPS (Logical
   Inferences Per Second). However, the utility of small benchmark
   programs like naive reverse (NREV) is questionable, since it may not
   necessarily reflect overall system performance. For example, NREV
   doesn't exercise the two main features of Prolog -- backtracking and
   unification. In practice, performance on large programs is much more
   important. Some of the benchmarks use larger programs, such as
   cryptarithms, theorem provers, and chart parsing, to give a better
   picture of system performance on real problems. Thus it is better
   to use the Pereira or Holmer benchmarks than the NREV benchmark.

Name:         ATN

Summary:      Prolog transition net interpreter.

Version:      11-JAN-91

Description: 

   This package is for those occasions when you need to represent a
   program as a network of labels and gotos. For example, it is useful
   when implementing a finite state machine or other transition networks.
   ATN defines predicates for loading and interpreting such networks.

   Here is an example network:

       go ::
           to count(1).

       count(10) ::
           write( 'Done.' ), nl
           to success.

       count(N) ::
           write( 'N = ' ), write( N ), write('.'), nl,
           Rem is N mod 2
           to odd(N) if Rem=1
           to even(N).

       odd(N) ::
           write( 'That is even.' ), nl
           to inc(N).

       even(N) ::
           write( 'That is odd.' ), nl
           to inc(N).

       inc(N) ::
           Ni is N+1
           to count(Ni).

   To run it, you would load it, and then call
       ?- do_node( go ).

   type-testing predicates; sorting and merging; readline; a predicate
   for getting the printable representation of a term; rational number
   predicates; and meta-logical predicates for dealing with true
   disjunction and negation.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/dlists/

Name:         DLISTS

Summary:      Prolog doubly-linked list package.

Version:      6-DEC-87 (3-NOV-87)

Description: 

   This is Jocelyn Paine's revised version of a doubly-linked
   list-handling package sent to the Prolog Digest by Philip Dart of
   Melbourne University. The syntax has been changed slightly to run in
   Edinburgh Prolog; otherwise, the predicates are the same.

   Philip sent the original package as a joke:
       "Following the comments [on the bulletin board] about Fortran as an
       AI language, Melbourne University Department of Artificial
       Intelligence has decided to convert all of its Fortran AI programs
       to NU-Prolog. This package has been written as an aid to this
       conversion.

       Doubly-linked list package: Why use boring old single-linked lists
       when doubly-linked list could make your list processing applications
       run as never before.

       P.S. Don't forget to turn off the occur-check in your version of
       Prolog!"

   However, it seems that the package might be useful in those few cases
   where you really *do* need circular structures (rather than using
   edge-sets to represent graphs), and Philip has agreed to let Jocelyn
   redistribute his package on this basis.

   Predicates defined:
       test                         Demonstrate the predicates
       dPrev(D, _)                  Get previous node
       dNext(D, _)                  Get next node
       dHead(D, _)                  Get head of list
       dTail(D, _)                  Get tail of list
       isD(D)                       Is this a doubly-linked list?
       portray(D)                   Portray doubly-linked list
       dAppend(X, Y, Z)             Append for doubly-linked lists
       dAdj(L, R)                   Are these adjacent nodes?

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/interval/

Name:         INTERVALS

Summary:      Prolog sets-as-interval predicates

Version:      21-DEC-87

Description: 

   This package defines predicates for manipulating sets of integers,
   represented as lists of disjoint intervals. This is a compact way of
   representing large sets, provided that they contain few gaps between
   intervals.

   Here are two examples of the representation:

      Set                                         Representation

      { -32768 .. 32767 }                         [ -32768--32767 ]

      { 1,3,4,5,9,10,11,12,15,16,100,101,102}     [ 1--1, 3--5, 9--12, 
                                                    15--16, 100--102 ]

   The predicates in this package include ones for forming the union,
   intersection, and difference of such sets, and for various operations
   on single intervals.

   For efficiency, the sets are kept in a canonical form. The intervals
   are disjoint, and are in ascending order, and form a minimal covering
   (i.e., there is no other representation of a set, using fewer
   intervals). There is a predicate for converting a list of arbitrary
   unordered intervals into a canonical form.

   The predicates are useful when writing programs for syntax-directed
   translation of character data. For example, some tag field on a line
   may specify that the line is a record of type R1 if the field lies in
   the set C1 of characters, or a record of type R2 if the field lies in
   the set C2 of characters, and so on. Using these predicates, one can
   check for ambiguous specifications by testing whether C1 and C2
   overlap; and one can generate quick tests for whether some character
   is in C1 or C2 by knowing that the set are represented by as few
   intervals as possible.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/jorge/

Name:         

Summary:      Prolog list-handling predicates.

Version:      21-DEC-87

Description: 

   This package contains some list-handling predicates contributed by
   Jorge Forero.  The predicates include: test for list-ness; test for
   sublist; find element at known position, or position of known element;
   remove duplicates; flatten a list; add element after known element;
   and find that part of a list following a given element.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/length/

Name:         

Summary:      Bounded-length version of the list-length predicate

Version:      21-AUG-93 (26-FEB-91)

Description: 

   Many Prologs have a built-in function length/2 that can be used either
     [1] to determine the length of a given list; or
     [2] to non-deterministically create longer and longer lists.

   This package defines a function length_bounded/3 with the following
   specification:

       length_bounded(?L,?Len,+Max)
       "L is a list of length Len, where Len<=Max".

   Like length/2, it can bind L to successively longer lists when Len is
   unbound, but subject to the constraint that Len<=Max. It uses ":-wait"
   declarations and hence needs to run under Sicstus Prolog.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/trees/

Name:         

Summary:      Prolog 2-3 Trees Package

Version:      21-AUG-91

Description: 

   This package contains a set of Prolog predicates for associating
   keys with values using 2-3 trees. Because 2-3 trees are used, they
   automatically rebalance after each insertion or deletion.

   For example,

       ?-
       list_to_23( [ cat-dog,
                     hare-rabbit,
                     "hair"-"fur",
                     king-queen,
                     exp(1)-2.71828,
                     3.141593-pi
                   ],
                   Tree
                 ),
       portray_23( Tree ),
       put_23( 39, Tree, steps, Tree1 ),
       portray_23( Tree1 ).

   gives

       23 Tree{
         3.141593 - pi
         cat - dog
         hare - rabbit
         king - queen
         exp(1) - 2.71828
         [104, 97, 105, 114] - [102, 117, 114]
       }

       23 Tree{
         3.141593 - pi
         39 - steps
         cat - dog
         hare - rabbit
         king - queen
         exp(1) - 2.71828
         [104, 97, 105, 114] - [102, 117, 114]
       }

   There is no routine for deleting items from a tree (you can replace
   them), but it would not be hard to write one.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/code/ext/vaucher/

Name:         

Summary:      Jean Vaucher's implementation of structures in Prolog.

Version:      15-AUG-89

Description: 

   This package is taken from Vaucher's Software P&E article.  It
   provides a set of primitive predicates and operators that allow the
   arguments of Prolog structures to be accessed by name rather than
   position, like Lisp-style property lists. This improves the
   readability and maintainability of Prolog programs.

   Examples:
   ---------

       ?- def_record( person(name,age,address) ).
       Define a template for the 'person' structure.

       ?- inst( person, P ),
          field( P..name, 'Matthew Latner Linton' ),
          field( P..name, Z ).
       Create a 'person' in P, set its name, and unify that name with Z.

       ?- def_record( address(number,street,town) ).
       Template for the 'address' structure.

       ?- inst( address, A ),
          inst( person, P ),
          field( P..address, A ),
          field( P..age, 25 ),
          field( P..address..street, 'St. Peter's Street' ).
          field( P..address..town, 'Hanningtown' ).
       Create an address A and person P, and set some fields.

       ?- inst( person, P ),
          field( P..name, 'Fred' ), field( P..age, 25 ),
          update( P..name, 'Bert', P2 ).
       Create a person, and use 'update' to make a modified copy.

Summary:      Prolog program that plays the Mastermind code-breaking game.

Version:      21-AUG-83

Description: 

   This program implements the game of Mastermind. Either the user or the
   program tries to break a hidden color code, consisting of the colors
   black, blue, red, green, yellow, white. The results of a guess (black:
   a color is at the right position; or white: a color occurs in the
   code) are internally represented as successors of 0. This could be
   extended to handle integers. When the program is making guesses, it
   uses a simple but powerful generate-and-test procedure, where the
   scores for previous attempts are used as the test criterion.

   you'll need to unpc them (remove the extra carriage returns).  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/code/fun/ttt/

Name:         TIC-TAC-TOE

Summary:      A Prolog implementation of Noughts and Crosses

Version:      FEB-91

Description: 

   This program was written by David Green as an MSc exercise when he was
   at Edinburgh University in 1991.

   The most interesting thing about it is its use of a 3x3 'magic square'
   to represent the playing area. This means that each position on the
   noughts & crosses board is given a numerical value:

       8 3 4
       1 5 9
       6 7 2

   It is a property of this magic square that each winning line in noughts
   & crosses has a total sum of 15. Thereore, 15 as a sum of three numbers
   uniquely defines a particular winning position of the game. The game
   state is stored as a list of the numbers which have been 'taken' so far
   by the user, a list of the numbers which have similarly been taken by
   the computer, and finally a list representing the current board state,
   in which positions which have previously been filled by either player
   are marked with an 'o' or an 'x' as is appropriate. Furthermore, this
   representation makes it possible to refer to any vacant board position
   by a single number from 1 to 9.

Summary:      Prolog to SQL interface

Version:      1.1 (21-DEC-92)

Description: 

   PL2SQL is a Prolog to SQL compiler. It translates database access
   requests, which consist of a projection term and a database goal, to
   the appropriate SQL query. This compiler may be useful in
   Prolog-to-RDBMS interfaces, which often allow SQL queries as string
   arguments (e.g. the Quintus Prolog Oracle interface and others).
   The compiler allows negation, arithmetic, and aggregate functions.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/io/turtle/

Name:         

Summary:      Prolog turtle graphics.

Version:      12-DEC-87 (25-MAR-87)

Description: 

   This is a simple turtle graphics program for vt100 terminals written
   by David Lau-Kee and originally posted to the Prolog Digest. A few
   syntactic errors were corrected by Salleh Mustaffa, University of
   Manchester.  There may be some problems due to control characters in
   the program not being properly transmitted through email in the
   original posting.

   A limited subset of turtle graphics capabilities is implemented: You
   can tell the turtle to turn 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise, and
   to move forward X steps.  Backtracking over these primitives causes
   them to be undone.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/library/

Name:         Prolog Library

Summary:      A collection of Prolog programs from the defunct Prolog-Hackers
              mailing list.

Version:      21-AUG-90

Description: 

   This directory contains a collection of Prolog programs from the
   now-defunct Prolog Hackers mailing list. Fernando Pereira maintained
   the collection.  Many of the programs are over 10 years old. The
   programs were originally tested on DEC-10s and DEC-20s with the
   Edinburgh Prolog system. Compatibility with modern Prologs has not
   been tested, but most of the programs should run with only minor
   changes. Some of the files in this package have been duplicated
   elsewhere in the Prolog Repository, but we felt it was important to
   retain the package intact despite the duplication.

   The library includes implementations of trace, advice, macro
   expansion, gensym, heaps, sorting, queues, random number generators,
   set manipulation routines, splay trees, binary trees, and association
   lists. There's also an implementation of Mackworth's AC-3 algorithm,
   several debuggers, a Prolog parser, a top-level loop, graph processing
   utilities, a metacircular interpreter for Prolog, a program for
   converting formulae in FOPC to clausal form, a translator from
   Definite Clause Grammars to Prolog, a compiler for Flat Concurrent
   Prolog, routines for structure crunching, a rational arithmetic
   package, an algebraic expression simplifier, a pretty printer,
   tutorial programs, cross-referencing programs, a Prolog lint, and a
   Prolog type checker.  The library also includes the ECRC benchmarks,
   the WGSYM (Information Processing Society of Japan) Lisp/Prolog
   benchmarks, and the Tektronix/Portland State University benchmarks.
   Among the documents are the user's manual for Edinburgh Prolog on the
   DEC-10, the original Scribe draft manuscript for a Prolog standard
   by O'Keefe, and a few bibliographies.

   disjunction is transparent to cut just like conjunction.  

   If it doesn't work in your Prolog, and if you paid more than $100 for
   it, take your Prolog back to the shop and insist that they fix it,
   there are at least four different ways of implementing disjunction so
   that it works.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/parsing/ale/

Name:         ALE

Summary:      Attribute Logic Engine

Version:      13-JAN-93 (beta)

Description: 

   ALE (Attribute Logic Engine) is a system implemented in Prolog that
   integrates phrase structure parsing and constraint logic programming
   with typed feature structures as terms. Types are arranged in an
   inheritance hierarchy and specified for the features and value types
   for which they are appropriate. Grammars may also interleave
   unification steps with logic program goal calls (as can be done in
   DCGs), thus allowing parsing to be interleaved with other system
   components. While ALE was developed to handle HPSG grammars, it can
   also execute PATR-II grammars, DCG grammars, Prolog, Prolog-II, and
   LOGIN programs, etc. Grammars and programs are specified with a
   version of Rounds-Kasper Attribute Value Logic with macros and
   variables. ALE supports lexical rules and empty categories for
   grammars, using a bottom-up, breadth-first dynamic chart parser. ALE
   supports last call optimization, negation by failure and cuts in
   definite clauses, which may be used independently or integrated into
   grammars.

Version:      6-DEC-87

Description: 

   This program defines a predicate, 'grexpand', for expanding Definite
   Clause Grammar Rules into Prolog clauses. These are the standard form
   of DCG rules, for which a translator is built-in to many Prologs.  The
   translator is essentially the same as the one published in
   "Programming in Prolog", by Clocksin and Mellish.

   GULP (Graph Unification Logic Programming) is a Prolog preprocessor
   for unification-based grammar. It translates feature structures into
   standard Prolog programs. GULP is as powerful and concise as PATR-II
   and other grammar development tools, while retaining all the
   versatility of Prolog.

Description: 

   LP is a parser for standard Prolog text written in C. It consists of
   only three modules (tokenizer, parser, and display routine) and an
   interface module to integrate it with an existing Prolog system. It is
   completely deterministic and about 10 times faster than O'Keefe's
   public domain parser written in Prolog.

   A small demonstration program is included. This program is not optimal
   at all, but shows how it can be used.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/syntax/compiler/

Name:         GRIPS Compiler

Summary:      Grips/Prolog demonstration mini-compiler.

Version:      11-JAN-91

Description: 

   This is a demonstration compiler, written in a functional language
   (GRIPS) that can be translated into Prolog.  The GRIPS translator is
   available separately.

   The compiler takes programs in a (very small) subset of Pascal.  It
   lexically analyzes them into tokens, parses the token list into a
   tree, generates code from the tree, fixes up references in the code,
   and then interprets the code on a stack virtual machine. It displays
   the output of each stage, and the interpreter displays the machine
   state as each instruction is obeyed.

   The compiler is written in a functional style, using functions
   (sometimes represented as sets of domain->codomain pairs) to represent
   well-known concepts in programming language semantics, such as the
   store and the environment.  

   Here is an example program that it can compile and run.

       program p;

       label
           99, 100;

       const
           five = 5;

       var
           v : integer;
           w : integer;

       begin
           write('Hello.');
           v := 1;
           w := 1;
       99:
               if v=five then goto 100;
               v := v + 1;
               w := w * v;
               goto 99;
       100:
           write('v = ');
           write(v);
           write('v! = ');
           write(w)
       end.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/syntax/dctg/

Name:         DCTG

Summary:      Prolog definite clause translation grammar translator.

Version:      21-JUL-90

Description: 

   Definite Clause Translation Grammars are described in chapter 9 of
   Abramson and Dahl's book "Logic Grammars".  They were devised by
   Abramson to overcome the defects of Definite Clause Grammars, in which
   syntax and semantics are often mixed in a non-modular fashion.  They
   avoid also the problem with the proliferation of unnamed arguments
   that afflicts Definite Clause Grammars.

   In a DCTG, the syntax and semantics are separated. Each rule contains
   first a syntactic part, and then an optional semantics, written as one
   or more clauses. An example is given below. See Ambramson and Dahl's
   book for more details.  The code in this package comes from Appendix
   II of the book, with a few minor changes by Jocelyn Paine.

   The following example shows how to parse binary numbers with binary
   points (such as 1.1 or 1001.11) when expressed as lists ([1,'.',1] or
   [1,0,0,1,'.',1,1]).

       bit ::= [0]
       <:>
       bitval( 0, _ ).

       bit ::= [1]
       <:>
       bitval( V,Scale ) ::- V is **(2,Scale).

       bitstring ::= []
       <:>
       length(0)
       &&
       value(0,_).

       bitstring ::= bit^^B, bitstring^^B1
       <:>
       length( Length ) ::-
           B1 ^^ length(Length1),
           Length is Length1 + 1
       &&
       value( Value, ScaleB ) ::-
           B ^^ bitval( VB, ScaleB ),
           S1 is ScaleB - 1,
           B1 ^^ value( V1, S1 ),
           Value is VB + V1.

       number ::= bitstring ^^ B, fraction ^^ F
       <:>
       value(V) ::-
           B ^^ length(Length),
           S is Length-1,
           B ^^ value( VB, S ),
           F ^^ fractional_value( VF ),
           V is VB + VF.

       fraction ::= ['.'], bitstring ^^ B
       <:>
       fractional_value( V ) ::-
           S is -1,
           B ^^ value( V, S ).

       fraction ::= []
       <:>
       fractional_value(0).

       test( L, V ) :-
           write( 'LIST ' ), write( L ), nl,
           number( Tree, L, [] ),
           Tree ^^ value( V ),
           write( 'VALUE ' ), write( V ), nl, nl.

       ?- test( [1,'.',1], V ).
          /*  Should set V to 1.5.  */

Package:      lang/prolog/code/syntax/grips/

Name:         GRIPS Translator

Summary:      GRIPS -- A functional language in Prolog

Version:      11-JAN-91

Description: 

   GRIPS is a pre-processor for translating a functional version of
   Prolog into Prolog.  By using it, you can eliminate the tedium of
   having to think up variables to pass output from one predicate to the
   input of the next, and of having to flatten nested arithmetic 
   expressions into a sequence of machine-code-like assignments.

   Here are two example definitions.

           factorial(N) <- 1 if N =< 0.
           factorial(N) <- N * factorial(N-1) if N > 0.

           count( [] ) <- 0.
           count( [_|T] ) <- 1 + count(T).

   You can load these by doing 'grips_consult' or 'grips_reconsult' on the
   file they're in. You could then run the interpreter:

           ?- grips.
           |: do grips_reconsult('test.html').
           Done
           |: factorial(3).
           Result = 6.
           |: factorial(factorial(3)).
           Result = 720.
           |: count( [a,b,c,d] ).
           Result = 4.
           |: 1 + count([a,b,c,d])/factorial(3).
           Result = 1.66667.
           |: pr( factorial(3,F) ).

           F = 6
           More (y/n)? |: y
           no
           |:

   A simple compiler written in GRIPS is available separately.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/testing/autotest/

Name:         AUTOTEST

Summary:      Prolog predicate auto-tester

Version:      20-FEB-88

Description: 

   This program reads a file or files of Prolog goals, where each goal is
   accompanied by a specification saying whether it should succeed, fail,
   cause an error, or pass some tests on its bound variables.

   For each goal/specification pair, the program calls the goal, and
   compares its effect against the specification. If they differ, then a
   warning message is displayed. This is useful for automatically testing
   predicates against their expected outputs - the test files can be
   kept, and re-run every time a predicate is changed.

   As an example, a test file for 'functor', and good old 'append' and
   'member' might contain these lines:

       append( [], [1,2,3], [1,2,3] ) :: succeeds.
       append( [1,2,3], [], [1,2,3] ) :: succeeds.
       append( [1,2], [3,4,5], [1,2,3,4,5] ) :: succeeds.

       member( any, [] ) :: fails.
       member( any, [a,b,c,d,e,any] ) :: succeeds.
       member( any, [a,b,c,d,e] ) :: fails.

       functor( f(1,2), F, A ) :: F = f, A = 2.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/tools/caslog/

Name:         CASLOG

Summary:      Complexity Analysis System for LOGic

Version:      1.0 alpha (20-DEC-92)

Description: 

   CASLOG (Complexity Analysis System for LOGic) is an experimental
   semi-automatic complexity analysis system for logic programs. It can
   perform the worst-case analysis for complexity measures: argument size
   complexity, number of solutions complexity, and time complexity.

   CASLOG extends the techniques developed for analyzing imperative and
   functional languages to deal with nondeterminism and generation of
   multiple solutions via backtracking in logic languages. The analyses
   for different complexity measures are implemented in a unified
   framework and share several common features. First, the predicates in
   a program are processed in an order generated by a bottom-up
   topological sorting over the call graph of the program. Second, the
   complexity function for a predicate is derived from the complexity
   function of its clauses by using the information about the mutual
   exclusion relationships between its clauses. Third, the complexity
   function for a clause is inferred based on the data dependency
   relationships between its literals. Fourth, the complexity functions
   for recursive clauses are in the form of difference equations and are
   transformed into closed form functions using difference equation
   solving techniques. This unified framework can simplify proofs of
   correctness and the implementation of the algorithms.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/tools/edinbrgh/

Name:         EDINBURGH TOOLS

Summary:      Edinburgh DEC-10 Prolog utility library.

Version:      6-JUL-88

Description: 

   The Edinburgh DEC-10 Prolog Library is a large collection of Prolog
   routines, written largely by researchers and students in Alan Bundy's
   Mathematical Reasoning Group at the Department of Artificial
   Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. 

   These programs are all examples of using Prolog programming to deal
   with objects and problems of many kinds. Some of them are very good
   examples, others are not so; some are well commented, some have
   separate documentation, some have none. You may be able to load the
   tools for low-level operations into your code ready-made, or you may
   not.  Browsing through the code will give you an insight into how to
   write good Prolog programs.

   The Edinburgh Library includes programs for data structure definition
   and manipulation, the input and output of structured and unstructured
   data, and extensions to Prolog and definitions of parts of the
   Prolog system in Prolog. It also includes files relating to the
   development of Prolog programs and demonstration and teaching materials.

   Programs include advice, a metacircular interpreter for maintaining
   extended and-or trees, an implementation of Mackworth's AC-3
   algorithm, Winston's arch, association lists, missionaries and
   cannibals, a program for bundling/unbundling files, a program for
   converting FOPC formulas to clausal form, a program for solving
   cryptarithms, implementation of Definite Clause Slash Grammar, the
   DEC-10 compatibility file for C-Prolog 1.4a, the 8-puzzle, Evans'
   geometric analogy program, simple macro expansion, random number
   generators, an implementation of gensym, graph processing utilities,
   an implementation of heaps, an implementation of intelligent
   backtracking, an interactive cross referencer, lazy lists, list
   handling utilities, a Logo-like inference package, rational
   arithmetic, an elementary module system, an implementation of Mycin,
   ordered set manipulation, an implementation of tic tac toe, a pretty
   printer, the N-Queens problem, queue operations, a tokenizer, a
   production system, sorting routines, an algebraic expression
   simplifier, a code profiler (timer), a toplevel loop, trace, binary
   trees, a Prolog type checker, an implementation of unit resolution, a
   conditional plan generator, and formatted output.

Package:      lang/prolog/code/tools/ptn/

Name:         PTN

Summary:      Parse Tree Notation

Version:      25-MAY-94

Description: 

   Parse Tree Notation (PTN) facilitates the encoding of language
   translators which transform programs written in high level languages
   with extensions (e.g. a logic language with functional programming
   features) into equivalent programs in the original unextended languages
   (e.g. Prolog). PTN does this by offering a small set of operations and
   built-in predicates for manipulating program parse trees. More
   complicated actions can be readily coded by combining PTN with Prolog
   predicates.

   The main PTN operation augments unification with pattern matching
   capabilities based on the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) for the
   language of the program being manipulated. This allows parse tree
   searches to be specified, based on the terminal and nonterminal types
   of the language, without the programmer having to augment the DCG or to
   write specialized tree manipulation predicates.

   There are numerous example translators in the distribution, including:
      -  a translator for a simple functional LP language
      -  a translator for a  LP language with modules
      -  a text analyzer for grades
      -  a translator for an if-then rule-based system
      -  a text analyzer for phone lists
      -  a translator for a LP language with attribute/name arguments
      -  a translator that adds proof tree arguments to programs

   PTN notation in a translator is itself translated into vanilla Prolog
   using a PTN translator.

Description: 

   PI (Portable Interfaces for Prolog applications) is an interface
   between Prolog applications and the X Window System that aims to be
   independent from the Prolog engine, provided that it has a
   Quintus-style foreign function interface (such as SICStus, YAP).  It
   is mostly written in Prolog and is divided into two libraries:

      1. Edipo, a low-level interface to the Xlib functions that allows
         you to create and manage windows, use graphical primitives, and 
         receive events, and 

      2. Ytoolkit, a high-level user interface toolkit that allows you to
         create and manage graphical objects, define new classes of objects,
         and handle user interaction.

Version:      4.6.6

Description: 

   XPCE is an object-oriented X-window interface toolkit for symbolic
   programming languages (Prolog and Lisp), offering a high level of
   abstraction for communication with X11, Unix processes, Unix
   networking facilities (sockets) and Unix files. XPCE's built-in
   classes (about 150) are mostly written in C.  The XPCE/Prolog
   interface allows the user to create and manipulate instances of these
   classes.  The user can also create new XPCE classes from Prolog.
   XPCE's window related classes provide various styles of menus,
   primitive graphical objects, compound graphical objects and Emacs
   oriented programmable text manipulation windows. The distribution
   contains several demo programs, including a diagram drawing tool
   (PceDraw), an animation demo, an Epoch-like editor (PceEmacs), a graphical
   interface to Unix ispell, and an online hyper-text manual for XPCE
   itself (PceManual). 

   This directory contains copies of the license agreement,

Description: 

   XWIP (X Window Interface for Prolog) allows Prolog to be used as a
   client program for the X Windows System. The additional functions it
   provides are similar in form to the Xlib C language library.

   XWIP is written in Prolog and partly in the C language. XWIP uses a
   foreign function interface to allow the Prolog code to call the C
   code. The C code in turn calls the Xlib C language library.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/fp_lp/alf/

Name:         ALF

Summary:      Algebraic Logic Functional programming language

Version:      23-JUN-92 (ALF preprocessor 0.7.3, FlatALF Compiler
              2.13, A-WAM Bytecode Interpreter 0.5.9)

Description: 

   ALF (Algebraic Logic/Functional programming language) is a programming
   language that combines functional and logic programming techniques.
   ALF is based on Horn clause logic with equality. Predicates and Horn
   clauses are used for logic programming, and functions and equations
   for functional programming. Any functional expression can be used in a
   goal literal, and any predicate can occur in the conditions of an
   equation. 

   The ALF system is implemented using a combination of resolution,
   narrowing, rewriting and rejection. The resolution rule is used to
   solve literals and narrowing to evaluate functional expressions.  The
   number of possible narrowing steps is reduced by a leftmost-innermost
   basic narrowing strategy, and terms are simplified by rewriting before
   narrowing is applied.  Equations are also rejected if the two sides
   have different constructors at the top.  Rewriting and rejection can
   result in a large reduction of the search tree.  Thus the operational
   semantics of ALF is more efficient than Prolog's resolution strategy.

   Like Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking strategy corresponding to a
   depth-first search in the derivation tree.  ALF programs are compiled
   into instructions of an abstract machine based on the Warren Abstract
   Machine (WAM) with several extensions to implement narrowing and
   rewriting. The emulator for A-WAM programs is written in C.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/fp_lp/eql/

Name:         EqL

Summary:      General purpose language combining functional and logic
              programming 

Version:      1.0 (May 1987)

Description: 

   EqL is a general-purpose language that combines the capabilities of
   functional and logic programming languages.  A program in EqL consists
   of a collection of conditional, pattern-directed rules, where the
   conditions are expressed as a conjunction of equations, and the
   patterns are terms built up of data-constructors and basic values.

   Due to its expressional syntax, EqL directly supports functional
   programming.  EqL also supports logic programming, as all its
   variables are 'logical variables' and Prolog-style nondeterminism is
   allowed.  A limited form of constraint reasoning, going beyond
   traditional functional and logic programming, is also supported.
   Further details of the language are described in UNC TR 87-010.

   The declarative semantics of a set of equations is expressed in terms
   of its complete set of solutions. The computational paradigm in EqL is
   equation solving, which may also be viewed as a form of 'innermost
   narrowing', a restriction on narrowing that enables more efficient
   computation of solutions (see the 1988 IEEE-SE paper for details).

   The EqL interpreter runs about half as fast as the C-Prolog
   interpreter on Vaxes and Suns, and has a modest number of features
   to aid debugging and program testing.

Version:      1.0 (18-MAR-94); 0.91 (11-FEB-93)

Description: 

   LIFE (Logic, Inheritance, Functions, and Equations) is an experimental
   programming language with a powerful facility for structured type
   inheritance. It reconciles styles from functional programming, logic
   programming, and object-oriented programming. It subsumes, and fully
   contains the functionality of, the precursor languages LOGIN and Le_Fun.
   The syntax of Wild_LIFE has been kept as close as possible to that of the
   Edinburgh family of Prolog so that Prolog compatibility is easy to
   achieve.

   From a theoretical point of view, LIFE implements a constraint logic
   programming language with equality (unification) and entailment (matching)
   constraints over order-sorted feature terms. The interplay of unification
   and matching provides an implicit coroutining facility thanks to an
   automatic suspension mechanism.  This allows interleaving interpretation
   of relational and functional expressions which specify structural
   dependencies on objects.

   Wild_LIFE includes a set of non-trivial example programs including an
   incremental Gaussian equation solver, a PERT scheduler, a full LIFE
   parser, a flower-drawing program that handles X events, uses an X
   toolkit and a 3D turtle graphics package written in LIFE and compiles
   rewrite rules into LIFE. It also includes an extensive test suite to
   verify the correct operation of the interpreter.

Version:      1.1 (2-FEB-94)

Description: 

   CORAL is a deductive database/logic programming system developed at
   the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is a declarative language
   based on Horn-clause rules with extensions like SQL's group-by and
   aggregation operators, and uses a Prolog-like syntax.

   CORAL supports many evaluation techniques, including bottom-up
   fixpoint evaluation and top-down backtracking, a module mechanism,
   support for disk-resident data, a C++ interface, and an on-line help
   facility.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/lp/lolli/

Name:         Lolli

Summary:      An interpreter for linear logic programming.

Version:      7.01 (1-DEC-92)

Description: 

   Lolli is an interpreter for logic programming based on intuitionist
   linear logic principles. Lolli, named for the linear logic implication
   operator "-o" called lollipop, is a full implementation of the
   language described in the Hodas & Miller paper "Logic Programming in a
   Fragment of Intuitionistic Linear Logic", though it differs a bit in
   syntax, and has several built-in extra-logical predicates and
   operators.

   The logic underlying Lolli can be viewed as a refinement of the the
   Hereditary Harrop formulas of Lambda-Prolog.  All the operators
   (though not the higher order unification) of Lambda-Prolog are
   supported, but with the addition of linear variations.  Thus a Lolli
   program distinguishes between clauses that can be used as many, or as
   few, times as desired, and those that must be used exactly once.

   These features have been used to provide a perspicuous, logical
   implementation of a number of example problems, including
   object-oriented programming with mutable state and information hiding,
   database update, and term rewriting.  Lolli has also been used as the
   setting for the development of a filler-gap dependency parser for
   natural language processing (see Hodas's JICSLP-92 paper).

   The preliminary implementation of Lolli is based on code written by
   Pfenning and Elliot for their paper "A Semi-Functional Implementation
   of a Higher-Order Logic Programming Language".

   The system is written in Standard ML of New Jersey, and the parser and
   lexer were built using the parser-generator (MLYACC) and
   lexical-analyzer-generator (MLLEX) distributed with that system.
   Though source files for the parser and lexer have been included, the
   parser and lexer have already been built, so you do not need access to
   the MLYACC or MLLEX.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/other/goedel/

Name:         Goedel

Summary:      Prolog-like language with improved declarative semantics.

Version:      1.4 (16-MAY-94); 1.3.27 (24-JAN-94)

Description: 

   GOEDEL is intended to be a declarative successor to Prolog.  The main
   design aim of Goedel is to have functionality and expressiveness
   similar to Prolog, but to have greatly improved declarative semantics
   compared with Prolog.  This improved declarative semantics has
   substantial benefits for program construction, compilation,
   verification, debugging, analysis, transformation, and so on.
   Considerable emphasis is placed on Goedel's meta-logical facilities,
   since this is where Prolog is most deficient.  In particular, Goedel
   has declarative replacements for Prolog's var, nonvar, assert, and
   retract.  Goedel is a strongly typed language, its type system being
   based on many-sorted logic with parametric polymorphism.

   Goedel's features include a module system, support for infinite
   precision integers, infinite precision rationals, and floating-point
   numbers, and support for processing of finite sets.  It can solve
   constraints over finite domains of integers and also linear rational
   constraints. It supports processing of finite sets.  It also
   has a flexible computation rule and a pruning operator which
   generalizes the commit of the concurrent logic programming languages.

   The release includes the Goedel system, the SAGE partial evaluator
   for Godel, a user manual, and 50 example programs.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/other/prosit/

Name:         PROSIT

Summary:      Programming in SItuation Theory

Version:      0.3 (10-AUG-91)

Description: 

   PROSIT (Programming in SItuation Theory) is a programming language
   similar to Prolog but based on Situation Theory instead of standard
   first-order logic.  PROSIT is a declarative language, that is,
   programs and data in PROSIT are all just sets of declarative elements
   called infons.  Answering queries about these infons is the
   fundamental action that the PROSIT interpreter carries out.  But
   unlike Prolog, PROSIT contains mechanisms for dealing with the
   ``situations'' of Situation Theory.  Infons in PROSIT are not absolute
   and global; they are local to situations.  Situations may be set up to
   inherit information from other situations.  Situations may contain any
   kind of information, including information about infons and
   situations.  PROSIT also supports forward chaining, in which the
   addition of new infons triggers the addition of other new infons,
   creating a constant flow of information through the system.  And as in
   Prolog, PROSIT can prove queries through backward chaining.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/other/sel2/

Name:         SEL2

Summary:      Declarative set-processing language that generates WAM code

Version:      2

Description: 

   SEL (Subset-Equational Language) is a declarative set processing
   language. Its main features are subset and equational program clauses,
   pattern matching over sets, support for efficient iteration and
   point-wise/incremental computation over sets, the ability to define
   transitive closures through circular constraints, meta-programming and
   simple higher-order programming, and a modest user-interface including
   tracing. The language seems well-suited to a number of problems in
   graph theory, program analysis, and discrete mathematics. The SEL
   compiler is written in Quintus Prolog and the run-time system is
   written in C. It generates WAM-like code, extended to deal with
   set-matching, memoization, and the novel control structure of the
   language.

   The release comes with a user manual, bibliography of papers
   (including .dvi files), several sample programs, and source code. 
   Example programs include a miniature Eliza, higher-order and
   meta-programming with apply and univ, permutations, quicksort, 
   maxflow using min-cut, lazy evaluator for equations, shortest
   distance in a directed graph, strongly connected components, and a
   meta-interpreter for basic SEL in SEL.

Name:         AKL

Summary:      Andorra Kernel Language, a concurrent constraint
              programming language.

Version:      0.9 (9-NOV-93)

Description: 

   AKL (Andorra Kernel Language) is a concurrent constraint programming
   language that supports both Prolog-style programming and committed
   choice programming.  Its control of don't-know nondeterminism is based
   on the Andorra model, which has been generalized to also deal with
   nondeterminism encapsulated in guards and aggregates (such as bagof)
   in a concurrent setting. 

   The Basic Andorra Model is a way to execute definite clause programs
   that allows dependent and-parallelism to be exploited transparently.
   It also supports nice programming techniques for search programs.  The
   idea is to first reduce all goals that match at most one clause.  When
   no such goal exists, any goal (e.g., the left-most) may be chosen.
   The BAM was proposed by David H. D. Warren, and his group at Bristol
   has developed an AND-OR parallel implementation called Andorra-I,
   which also supports full Prolog.  

   This implementation of the AKL Programming System (AKL/PS) consists of
   a compiler from AKL to PAM, a Prototype Abstract Machine for AKL, and
   an emulator for PAM written in C.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/parallel/bebop/

Name:         BeBOP, bp, and pnp

Summary:      Parallel Object-Oriented Logic Programming

Version:      1.0 (13-SEP-93)

Description: 

   The BeBOP language combines the features of sequential and parallel
   Logic Programming (LP), object oriented programming and meta-level
   programming. The goal of the system is to support the construction of
   multi-agent systems. 

   The LP component offers both don't know non-determinism and stream
   AND-parallelism, a combination not possible with concurrent LP
   languages. BeBOP's object oriented features include object IDs,
   encapsulation, message passing, state updating, and object behavior
   modification. The meta-level capabilities are based on the treatment
   of Prolog theories as first order entities, which enables them to be
   updated easily, and for fragments to be passed between objects in
   messages.

   An interactive interpreter named BP is included in the distribution.
   It supports incremental compilation and execution, and allows the
   communication links within an object network to be specified
   dynamically. BP also includes a history mechanism, allowing
   syntactically correct goals to be repeated, listed, and modified.
   Variables from previous queries can also be reused in later queries.
   BP is a superset of NU-Prolog's interpreter NP and so can seamlessly
   combine objects and prolog goals.

   BeBOP programs are compiled into NU-Prolog, and its parallel
   extension, PNU-Prolog (PNP). An unusual aspect of this is the way in
   which object IDs are utilized as a communication mechanism between
   objects. Code for the PNP preprocessor is included in the distribution. 

   NU-Prolog (AKA MU-Prolog) is a prolog interpreter implemented in C for
   BSD Unix available from the University of Melbourne.  Source licenses
   are available for educational institutions.  For more information,
   write to University of Melbourne, MU-Prolog Distribution, Department

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/parallel/fcp/

Name:         FCP

Summary:      Flat Concurrent Prolog

Version:      16-MAY-84

Description: 

   This directory contains a compiler for Flat Concurrent Prolog.  It
   compiles FCP clauses into PROLOG clauses and executes these according
   to the definition of FCP. The FCP to PROLOG compiler is a modification
   of the Concurrent Prolog to PROLOG compiler of Chikayama implemented
   by Udi Shapiro & Colin Mierowsky.

   Flat Concurrent Prolog corresponds to the AND parallel subset of
   Concurrent Prolog. It was introduced in order to gain experience with
   a number of implementation issues relating to Concurrent Prolog and to
   provide a basis for experimentation with various distributed and
   parallel algorithms.

   An FCP program differs from a CP program in that guard systems contain
   only boolean combinations (conjunctions and negations) of simple test
   predicates (guard_kernel predicates). Declaratively, FCP programs are
   the same as CP programs, but differ procedurally.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/parallel/ncl/

Name:         NCL

Summary:      Net-Clause Language

Version:      2.0 (1-JUL-93)

Description: 

   NCL (Net-Clause Language) is aimed at describing distributed
   computation models using term unification as a basic processing and
   control mechanism. It is embedded in standard Prolog and comprises two
   parts -- net-clauses and data-driven rules, which can communicate each
   to other and to standard Prolog programs through the unified
   representation of terms, the unification procedure and the database
   mechanism provided by Prolog.

   A net-clause is a special domain in the database defining a network of
   nodes and links. The nodes are represented by Prolog compound terms.
   The variables occurring within the nodes are global logical variables,
   which can be shared within the scope of the net-clause thus playing
   the role of network links. The net-clause nodes define local
   conditions for unification of terms or execution of Prolog goals.

   Thus two basic control mechanisms are implemented: 

      - A spreading activation scheme similar to the connectionist
        spreading activation and to the marker passing mechanism in
        semantic nets. In the framework of logic programming it is
        seen as a restricted (no recursion) forward chaining
        computation.

      - A default mechanism based on using variables to propagate
        terms without being bound to them, thus implementing the
        non-monotonicity of default reasoning. This is similar to
        Reiter's default assignment to variables.

   The Data-driven Rules implement a full scale forward chaining for Horn
   clauses.  They simulate a data-driven parallel computation, where each
   rule is a process (in contrast to the traditional parallel logic
   programming, like PARLOG, where each goal is a process).

   It is worth noting that NCL/Prolog is implemented in C as an augmented
   Prolog interpreter together with some Prolog routines, so it can also
   be used as a Prolog interpreter.

   NCL includes several annotated example programs: natural language
   parsing and semantic analysis, model-based diagnosis of a binary
   adder, 4-queens problem, recognition of geometric figures, and
   data-driven inductive learning.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/parallel/pcn/

Name:         PCN

Summary:      Program Composition Notation

Version:      2.0 (2-FEB-93)

Description: 

   PCN (Program Composition Notation) is a system for developing and
   executing parallel programs. It is not a logic programming language,
   but it has similarities to Strand and other concurrent logic
   programming languages. PCN provides a simple language for specifying
   concurrent algorithms, interfaces to Fortran and C, a portable toolkit
   that allows applications to be developed on a workstation or small
   parallel computer and run unchanged on supercomputers, and integrated
   debugging and performance analysis tools. PCN includes a runtime
   system, compiler, linker, a set of standard libraries, virtual
   topology tools, a symbolic debugger (PDB), an execution profiler
   (Gauge), and a trace analysis tool (Upshot).

   PCN was developed at Argonne National Laboratory and the California
   Institute of Technology.

Name:         Aquarius Prolog

Summary:      Information about Aquarius Prolog, a free (with license)
              high-performance portable implementation of Prolog. 

Version:      

Description: 

   Aquarius Prolog is a high-performance, portable Prolog implementation
   developed since 1989 by the Aquarius Project at UC/Berkeley, the Advanced
   Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACAL) at the University of Southern
   California (USC), and at Digital Equipment Corporation's Paris Research
   Laboratory. The developers are Tom Getzinger, Ralph Clarke Haygood, and
   Peter Van Roy. Aquarius Prolog includes:

      - A compiler with global analysis.  The compiler is built around the
        Berkeley Abstract Machine (BAM) execution model for Prolog. BAM
        retains desirable features of the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM),
        but allows for significant further optimizations and is easier to
        map onto actual general-purpose machines.

      - A back-end that maps the BAM onto various actual general-purpose
        machines, including MIPS R3000 (DEC Ultrix and MIPS RISC/os),
        SPARC (SunOS), HP 9000 300/400 with MC68020, MC68030 or MC68040
        processors (HP-UX), and Sun3 (SunOS).

      - A run-time system offering substantially the same built-in 
        predicates and memory management as Quintus Prolog, with additions 
        such as two kinds of destructive assignment.  Most of the built-in 
        predicates are written in Prolog, with little or no performance 
        penalty.

   Aquarius Prolog also includes an interpreter and documentation.
   Aquarius Prolog comes in two distributions, Enduser and Full. The
   latter includes full source code and implementation notes.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/beta_pl/

Name:         Beta Prolog

Summary:      Fast and portable Prolog emulator and compiler.

Version:      1.1 (11-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Beta-Prolog is an experimental Prolog system that provides many
   facilities for specifying and solving combinatorial problems. It
   supports the definition and manipulation of Boolean tables which can
   be used to represent graphs, simple and hierarchical domains, and
   situations in various combinatorial problems. Beta-Prolog also
   provides several primitives for describing constraint satisfaction 
   problems declaratively.

   The Beta-Prolog system consists of an emulator of the TOAM (matching
   Tree Oriented Abstract Machine) written in C and a compiler of
   Beta-Prolog written in Beta-Prolog itself. It differs from
   WAM-based systems mainly in the following two aspects: 

      (1) It translates predicates into trees and generates
          multi-level hashing code for predicates; 

      (2) It passes arguments directly in stack frames
          like most compilers of procedural languages.  

   Beta-Prolog is currently one of the fastest emulator-based Prolog
   systems. It will be of interest to Prolog users, programmers
   investigating search algorithms for combinatorial problems, and
   researchers who want to develop high-performance Prolog systems and/or
   evaluate compilation techniques for Prolog.

===========================================================================

Topic:        lang/prolog/impl/prolog/bin_pl/

Name:         BinProlog

Summary:      Fast, small, and portable Prolog compiler.

Description:

   BinProlog replaces the WAM by a more compact continuation passing
   logic engine based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic
   programs.  It includes an interface Tcl/Tk. 

   The compiler makes 528 KLIPS on a Sparc 10-40 (101 KLIPS on a NeXT)
   and still uses a very small (49K under Solaris 2.1) emulator, making
   it among the fastest freely available C-emulated Prologs (3-5 times
   faster than C-Prolog, 2-3 times faster than SWI-prolog, 1.5-2 times
   faster than (X)SB-prolog and close to C-emulated Sicstus 2.1.).

   BinProlog's very small code-size and high performances make it
   suitable to be integrated in industrial C-applications that need 
   the services of an embedded logic programming engine.

   Multi-BinProlog 2.00 is a prototype Linda-style parallel extension to
   BinProlog 1.71 developed by Koen De Bosschere and Paul Tarau. This
   version uses Koen's C-parser and C-writer which together speed-up IO
   considerably. It works with shared-memory and remote procedure calls.

   BinProlog includes many examples, such as a VT100 implementation of
   Tetris, a breadth-first meta-interpreter, an implementation of
   backpropagation (neural nets), a CHAT parser, and implementations of
   knight's tour and N-queens.

Summary:      Fast, small, and portable Prolog compiler.

Version:      2.20 (7-JAN-94)

Description: 

   BinProlog replaces the WAM by a more compact continuation passing
   logic engine based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic
   programs.  It includes an interface Tcl/Tk. 

   The compiler makes 528 KLIPS on a Sparc 10-40 (101 KLIPS on a NeXT)
   and still uses a very small (49K under Solaris 2.1) emulator, making
   it among the fastest freely available C-emulated Prologs (3-5 times
   faster than C-Prolog, 2-3 times faster than SWI-prolog, 1.5-2 times
   faster than (X)SB-prolog and close to C-emulated Sicstus 2.1.).

   BinProlog's very small code-size and high performances make it
   suitable to be integrated in industrial C-applications that need 
   the services of an embedded logic programming engine.

   Multi-BinProlog 2.00 is a prototype Linda-style parallel extension to
   BinProlog 1.71 developed by Koen De Bosschere and Paul Tarau. This
   version uses Koen's C-parser and C-writer which together speed-up IO
   considerably. It works with shared-memory and remote procedure calls.

   BinProlog includes many examples, such as a VT100 implementation of
   Tetris, a breadth-first meta-interpreter, an implementation of
   backpropagation (neural nets), a CHAT parser, and implementations of
   knight's tour and N-queens.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/bin_pl/tcl/

Name:         Tcl/Tk

Summary:      X-Windows Toolkits

Version:      TCL 7.3, TK 3.6

Description: 

   This directory contains the Tcl/Tk X-Windows toolkits for use with
   binprolog. Tcl stands for ``tool command language'' and is
   pronounced ``tickle.'' 

   Tcl is actually two things: a language and a library.  First, Tcl is a
   simple textual programming language, intended primarily for issuing
   commands to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers,
   illustrators, and shells. Second, Tcl is a library package that can be
   embedded in application programs.

   Tk is an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer with an
   interface to the X11 windowing system.

   For more information, see the Tcl/Tk FAQ in faq.tgz.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/eclipse/

Name:         ECLiPSe

Summary:      ECRC Logic Programming System

Version:      3.4

Description: 

   ECLiPSe (ECRC Logic Programming System) combines the functionalities
   of several ECRC systems, including Sepia, MegaLog and CHIP.  ECLiPSe
   includes a Prolog compiler with extended functionality that is Quintus
   and SICStus compatible, a tightly connected database system based on
   the BANG file system, a CLP system, and an interface to the Tcl/Tk X11
   toolkit. The BANG database can store not only relations, but also any
   Prolog structures and programs. The CLP system contains several
   libraries with various types of constraint handling schemes, including
   atomic finite domains, linear rational constraints, CHR (constraint
   handling rules) and Propia (generalized propagation).  It also
   supports writing further extensions like new user-defined constraints
   or complete new constraint solvers.  ECLiPSe also includes a profiler,
   user-definable syntax, metaterms as first-class citizens, coroutining,
   and unlimited precision integer and rational numbers. 

   ****************************************************************
   *** NOTE: It is not possible to put ECLiPSe itself in the    ***
   *** Repository or on the CD-ROM, because its use requires a  ***
   *** license agreement and payment of a nominal fee. This     ***

Name:         eLP

Summary:      Ergo Lambda Prolog

Version:      0.15 (12-FEB-90)

Description: 

   eLP (Ergo Lambda Prolog) is an interpreter written by Conal Elliott,
   Frank Pfenning and Dale Miller in Common Lisp and implements the core
   of lambda Prolog (higher-order hereditary Harrop formulas). It is
   embedded in a larger development environment called ESS (the Ergo
   Support System).  eLP implements all core language feature and offers
   a module system, I/O, some facilities for tracing, error handling,
   arithmetic, recursive top-levels, on-line documentation and a number
   of extended examples, including many programs from Amy Felty's and
   John Hannan's thesis.  

   (Lambda Prolog extends Prolog with a polymorphic type system,
   higher-order programming, simply typed lambda-terms as data
   structures, higher-order unification, scoping mechanisms for program
   clauses and parameters, and modules and data abstraction.)

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/eslpdpro/

Name:         ESL Prolog-2 (PD Version)

Summary:      Good performance public domain (limited) version of a
              Prolog for MS-DOS systems.

Version:      2.30 (30-JAN-91)

Description: 

   ESL Prolog-2 (PD Version) is a public domain Prolog interpreter for
   IBM PC (MS-DOS) systems with good performance. It deviates 
   slightly from Edinburgh standard (strings "like this" are not lists
   of ASCII codes), but you can add a declaration that makes it fully 
   Edinburgh-compatible. (To do this, add the line
      :- state(token_class,_,dec10).
   at the beginning of the program.) 

   ESL PD Prolog is a more limited version of the commercial version of
   the interpreter, which is available from Expert Systems Ltd. of
   Oxford, England (see contact below). The commercial version is an
   Edinburgh standard prolog interpreter and compiler with several
   extensions, and runs on Sun3, Sun4, HP9000 (Unix), RS/6000 (Unix), VAX
   (VMS), IBM PC (MS-DOS, Windows 3.0/3.1), and 386s. The windows version
   includes BIPs for programming windows graphics and dialogues.

   Documentation is available as a 2-volume set published by Ablex (type
   "prolog2" for info). ESL Prolog is also discussed extensively in Tony
   Dodd's book "Prolog: A Logical Approach" from Oxford University Press.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/frolic/

Name:         FROLIC

Summary:      Prolog implemented in Common Lisp and integrated with
              the FROBS knowledge representation system

Version:      19-AUG-93

Description: 

   FROLIC (Frobs + Logic) is an implementation of Prolog in Common Lisp
   that allows access to external knowledge bases. It was designed to
   provide a prolog-based interface to Frobs data structures. It uses
   a Lisp-like syntax instead of Prolog's syntax.

   Examples include a simple Eliza-like program.  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/icp/

Name:         ICP

Summary:      IC-Prolog ][, a multi-threaded Prolog implementation
              suitable for distributed applications.

Version:      ICP 0.96 (28-SEP-93); Parlog 1.5.9 (29-SEP-93)

Description: 

   IC-Prolog ][ (ICP) is a multi-threaded Prolog system developed at
   Imperial College. Multiple threads allow queries to be executed
   concurrently.  ICP also has an interface to Unix TCP/IP system calls
   and "mailboxes", a high level communication system.  This interface
   together with multiple threads enables distributed applications (such
   as client/server systems) to be written in Prolog.

   The package also includes a preprocessor for the Logic & Objects (L&O)
   object-oriented extension to Prolog. This gives a powerful structuring
   mechanism for Prolog programs as well as providing a logical
   interpretation of inheritance and other object-oriented features.
   (The sources for the L&O extension is also available to LPA MacProlog
   users in the subdirectory 'lo'.)

   Parlog has been integrated with IC-Prolog ][ as a separate thread, so
   applications may be written in either language depending on which is
   more suitable. (Standalone versions of the Parlog system for Sun-3 and
   Sun-4 can be found in the parlog/ directory.)

   The package also includes a simple expert system shell called Skilaki.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/icp/lo/

Description: 

   Logic and Objects (L&O) is an object-oriented extension to Prolog.
   This gives a powerful structuring mechanism for Prolog programs as
   well as providing a logical interpretation of inheritance and other
   object-oriented features.

   This directory contains the original version of L&O, which runs under
   LPA MacProlog on the Apple Macintosh.  The second implementation is
   included in the IC-Prolog II distribution itself.

Version:      2.1.2 (24-JAN-94)

Description: 

   JB-Prolog is a slim and powerful prolog for the Macintosh. Its key
   features are: Arbitrary long integers, fast interpreter only, source
   line debugger, user interface toolkit, persistent objects. 

   The demo program shows the capabilities of the persistent objects
   and user interface toolkit, which have not yet been documented.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/lmprolog/

Name:         LM-Prolog

Summary:      Prolog implemented in ZetaLisp for Lisp Machines.

Version:      4-JAN-90

Description: 

   LM-Prolog is an implementation of Prolog for the MIT family of Lisp
   Machines.  The Prolog dialect differs quite a bit from the Edinburgh
   Prolog family of dialects both in terms of syntax and built-in
   predicates.  The bulk of the code was written in 1983, when the
   authors were at Uppsala University.

   The implementation compiles Prolog predicates to Lisp functions, using
   success continuations to emulate the Prolog control structure.

   It is implemented in ZetaLisp and depends on features of ZetaLisp that
   will make it hard to port to Common Lisp, such as locatives, invisible
   pointers, and flavors.

   Examples include a Concurrent Prolog interpreter, Warren's
   benchmarks, Turtle graphics demos, and the Grammar Kit.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/lp/

Name:         LP

Summary:      Lambda Prolog

Version:      2.7 (10-NOV-88)

Description: 

   Lambda Prolog is an experimental implementation of a higher-order
   logic programming language.  It extends Prolog with a polymorphic type
   system, higher-order programming, simply typed lambda-terms as data
   structures, higher-order unification, scoping mechanisms for program
   clauses and parameters, and modules and data abstraction. These new
   features are provided in a principled fashion by extending the
   classical first-order theory of Horn clauses to the intuitionistic
   higher-order theory of hereditary Harrop formulas.

   Efficiency was not a consideration in the implementation, so this
   version of Lambda Prolog is slow. For a faster and more robust
   implementation of the language, see eLP (Ergo Lambda Prolog).

   The addition of higher-order unification to a programming language
   should be useful in proof systems, program transformation systems, 
   and natural language understanding systems.

Name:         Open Prolog

Summary:      Prolog interpreter for the Apple Macintosh

Version:      1.0.2d0

Description: 

   Open Prolog (OP) is a Prolog interpreter for the Apple Macintosh.  It
   follows the so-called 'Edinburgh' syntax and supports most standard
   Prolog features, including Definite Clause Grammars.  OP includes a
   debugger, good syntax error detection, and a flexible text editor. It
   is reasonably fast, and can execute large programs.  Extra predicates
   can be added via drop-in external predicates, in a manner similar
   to Hypercard's XCMDs.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/pdprolog/

Name:         A.D.A. PD Prolog

Summary:      A slow Prolog for MS-DOS systems.

Version:      1.90 (5-MAY-86)

Description: 

   A.D.A. Public Domain Prolog is a rather slow implementation of Prolog
   for MS-DOS systems, originally a product of Automata Design Associates
   (now defunct).

   The distribution includes some sample expert systems, including Simon
   Blackwell's "PIE" Truth Maintenance System, a few games written in
   Prolog (including Towers of Hanoi), a few puzzles, and Ludwig J.
   Schumacher's ATN-based natural language parser.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/pm/

Name:         Prolog/Mali

Summary:      Compiler for higher-order Lambda Prolog

Version:      1.8 (5-NOV-93)

Description: 

   Prolog/Mali is a compiler for the higher-order language Lambda Prolog.
   Lambda Prolog is an extension of Prolog defined by Miller. It is an
   extension of Prolog where terms are simply typed lambda terms and
   clauses are higher order hereditary Harrop formulas.  The main
   novelties are universal quantification on goals and implication.
   Prolog/Mali is a complete system which includes a C translator, a
   linker, libraries, runtime, and documentation, and runs on UNIX.

   Possible applications are the same as standard Prolog, but with a real
   plus for those where scoping of variables is important, such as
   theorem-proving, implementation of type systems, and formal
   transformation on structured programs.

   The system is a compiler (written in Prolog/Mali) which produces C
   code.  The execution scheme uses Mali (an abstract memory for
   representing terms with efficient space management). Accordingly,
   it is necessary to compile MALI before compiling PM. A copy of MALI
   version 6 (16-DEC-93) is included in this directory.

   (Lambda Prolog extends Prolog with a polymorphic type system,
   higher-order programming, simply typed lambda-terms as data
   structures, higher-order unification, scoping mechanisms for program
   clauses and parameters, and modules and data abstraction.)

   [For those of you who don't understand French:

    PrologIIR is a Prolog interpreter using MALI, an efficient memory
    system specially designed for Prolog implementations.  Compatible with
    PrologII from GIA Marseille, it offers rational trees unification and
    control predicates such as dif and freeze. Compared with PrologII,
    PrologIIR has few new features such as a garbage collector, some
    advanced OR-control facilities (a generalized cut), some advanced
    AND-control facilities (a delay mechanism based on groundness of
    terms), a sound implementation of negation, if-then-else and
    implication with explicit universal quantifiers, a configuration file
    and an interactive trace. Finally PrologIIR is faster than PrologII
    (up to 3 times on PC compatible computers).  PrologIIR is available on
    Sun3, Sun4, Gould NP1, UTX/32, IBM PC (XT, AT), and Macintosh. Only
    the Sun3 and Sun4 versions are included in this distribution.]

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/sbprolog/

Name:         SB-Prolog

Summary:      Stony Brook Prolog

Version:      2.5, 3.0, 3.1

Description: 

   SB-Prolog (Stony Brook Prolog) is a Prolog system for Unix and 386
   MS-DOS systems. It is based on an extension of the Warren Abstract
   Machine, which is written in C for enhanced portability.  The
   remainder of the system, including the translator from Prolog to the
   virtual machine instructions, is written in Prolog.  Prolog source
   programs can be compiled into machine-independent byte code files,
   which contain encodings of WAM instructions and are interpreted by
   the simulator. Among SB-Prolog's features are dynamic
   loading of predicates, an extension table facility that permits
   memoization of relations, macro definition/expansion, and tail
   recursion optimizations.

   ********************************************************************
   *** NOTE: SB-Prolog is superseded by XSB and hence is no longer  ***
   *** supported by Stony Brook or the University of Arizona. The   ***
   *** only reason to continue using SB-Prolog is for DOS, since    ***
   *** XSB does not run under DOS and there are currently no plans  ***
   *** to port it to DOS. XSB is more robust than SB-Prolog and     ***
   *** XSB's compiler is quite a bit faster. XSB also supports      ***
   *** tabling (OLDT evaluation) at the engine level, which lets    ***
   *** you write programs that are much cleaner, shorter, & faster. ***
   ********************************************************************

   There are three main versions: 2.5, 3.0, and 3.1. Version 2.5 runs
   on machines like Vax, Sun3, HP-9000, and Amiga, but not on alignment
   restricted processors like Sun4, Pyramid-98x, DEC3100 and SGI Iris.
   Versions 3.0 and 3.1 do run on alignment-restricted systems, but lack
   some builtin predicates. There were many different copies of the
   different versions floating about; we've tried to resolve the
   differences as best as possible. (Some of the differences had to do
   with garbage collection, which was apparently buggy.) 

   All the versions contain a couple of benchmarks, such as naive
   reverse and Pereira's benchmark suite, and some documentation.
   Other documentation is also available in the doc.tar file.

   The msdos subdirectory contains the 386 MS-DOS port of SB-Prolog
   version 3.1.01 (31-OCT-91).  It was compiled using version 1.05 of the
   386 MS-DOS GNU C compiler port by D. J. Delorie.  It supports up to
   128M of extended memory and 128M of disk space for swapping.  It is
   compatible with XMS and VCPI programs (such as QEMM and 386MAX), but
   not DPMI (such as Windows 3.0).

   The Amiga port is in the amiga directory and includes a hypertext
   version of the SB-Prolog manual for version 2.5 of the language.

   The hilog directory contains a prototype of SB-HiLog that runs
   under Quintus Prolog and SB-Prolog. SB-HiLog is an extension of
   Prolog that possesses a higher-order syntax, so that arbitrary
   terms may occupy the function position of terms. (XSB also includes
   a version of HiLog.)

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/schelog/

Name:         Schelog

Summary:      Embedding of Prolog in Scheme

Version:      2 (18-FEB-93)

Description: 

   ScheLog is an implementation of Prolog in Scheme. It is a
   collection of macros that expand syntax for clauses, elations, and
   so on into pure Scheme. It should run in any R4RS Scheme, has been
   tested in SCM, and will run any Scheme implementation that supports
   SLIB (the Standard Scheme Library).

   This implementation uses Scheme's first-class full continuations to
   implement Prolog's backtracking mechanism. (See the papers in
   references below for information on this type of embedding.) Its use
   of higher-order continuations is probably a major obstacle to porting
   it to Common Lisp.   

   The file portable.tar contains sample initialization files that
   must be customized for your dialect of Scheme and loaded before
   runing Schelog.

Summary:      Prolog implemented in Scheme, with interval arithmetic.

Version:      1.2 (12-JUN-92)

Description: 

   Prolog in Scheme is a collection of macros that expand syntax for
   clauses, elations, and so on. It is written in Scheme and has support
   for delayed goals and interval arithmetic. It is known to run in Chez
   Scheme and in Elk, and is intended to be portable to other Scheme
   implementations. It relies on continuations, and so is not easily
   ported to Common Lisp.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/sicstus/

Name:         SICStus

Summary:      Information about SICStus Prolog for Unix.

Version:      2.1

Description: 

   SICStus Prolog is a portable implementation of Prolog, written at SICS
   (Swedish Institute of Computer Science) with support in part from
   Ericsson Telecom AB, NobelTech Systems AB, Infologics AB, and
   Televerket under the Swedish Board for Industrial Development of
   Information Technology.

   Written in C and Prolog, the implementation is based on the Warren
   Abstract Machine (WAM).  The programming environment has benefited
   from public domain code contributed principally by R.A. O'Keefe and
   D.H.D. Warren.  An execution profiling package was written by M.M.
   Gorlick and C.F. Kesselman at the Aerospace Corporation.

   SICStus Prolog is portable to most UNIX(TM) machines (Berkeley UNIX is
   preferred over System V).  It provides indexed interpreted and
   compiled predicates mixed arbitrarily, unbounded precision integer and
   double precision floating point arithmetic, unification and term
   comparison of cyclic structures, a garbage collector and stack
   shifter, attention key (control-c) handling, a "procedure box"
   debugger, dynamic interfacing to C functions, backtrackable
   side-effects, coroutining facilities, execution profiling, and a
   machine-independent WAM compiler. 

   SICStus Prolog also includes a module system, Boolean constraint
   solver, native code compilers for Sun-3/4 and 68K-based NeXT, "Block"
   declarations (generalizing "wait" declarations), Prolog queries
   callable by C programs, support for building stand-alone applications,
   a Prolog library, a facility for storing Prolog clauses on files with
   user-defined indexing, a graphics package using InterViews 2.6, a
   graphical interface to the profiling package, a multiprocessing
   package based on the Linda model, exception raising and handling,
   several new built-in arithmetic functions, and time-out and socket
   communication primitives. SICS Aurora and Echo is a parallel emulator
   for Sequent Balance, Sequent Symmetry, Encore Multimax, and BBN
   Butterfly (Unix).

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/swi_pl/

Name:         SWI Prolog

Summary:      Fairly complete Edinburgh-style Prolog.

Version:      1.9 (5-JUN-94); 1.8.7 (31-JAN-93)

Description: 

   SWI-Prolog is a fairly complete Edinburgh-style Prolog. It includes a
   fast compiler, a profiler, a transparent and fast C interface (both
   Prolog calling C and C calling Prolog), a Quintus-like module system,
   garbage collector, stack expander, and dynamic autoloading of
   libraries.  It also includes a GNU-readline and GNU-Emacs interface.
   SWI-Prolog has a large set of built-in predicates in common with
   C-Prolog, Quintus and SICStus Prolog, so programs written for
   SWI-Prolog should be fairly portable to other prolog implementations.

   SWI-Prolog has no built-in facilities for graphics, but XPCE works
   with SWI-Prolog. (XPCE is a language-independent interface to X11 that
   provides a high level of abstraction.)

   The system has been very stable since version 1.5.  Most of the
   changes since then are new features and minor bug fixes.

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/wamcc/

Name:         WAMCC

Summary:      WAM-based Prolog to C compiler

Version:      2.1 (8-JUN-94)

Description: 

   WAMCC is a WAM-based Prolog to C compiler.  It conforms more or less
   to the Edinburgh standard, and includes most of the usual built-in
   predicates, a top-level, a Prolog debugger and a WAM debugger. WAMCC
   is designed to be easily extended (see clp(FD), for example). WAMCC's
   speed is halfway between SICStus emulated and SICStus native code on a
   Sparc (1.5 times faster and 1.5 times slower, respectively).

   Examples include a calendar program and the 8-queens problem.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/impl/prolog/xsb/

Name:         XSB Prolog

Summary:      Prolog extended with OLDT (tabling) and Hilog terms.

Version:      1.3 (14-SEP-93)

Description: 

   XSB is a Prolog-based Logic Programming System that extends the
   standard functionality of Prolog with an implementation of OLDT
   (tabling) and HiLog terms. XSB includes an optimizing compiler, C
   interface, a module system, list processing libraries, and dynamic
   loading. It is a descendent of PSB-Prolog and SB-Prolog.

   OLDT resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing
   programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does not.
   Users interested in Parsing, Program Analysis, and memory-resident
   Deductive Database applications may benefit from XSB.

   XSB's OLDT implementation:

       o  Is incorporated at the emulator level for maximal efficiency.
          The speed improvement over meta-interpreters written by
          the XSB group is 2-3 orders of magnitude, with considerable
          improvements in space as well.

       o  Evaluates programs with (left-to-right modularly) stratified
          negation and aggregation.

       o  Allows for declaration of tabled predicates either
          automatically by the system or manually by the user.

       o  Provides standard tabling predicates which can be used to
          program a number of applications like meta-interpreters for
          the well-founded semantics (provided as an example program).

       o  Allows full Prolog functionality in tabled code, including
          cuts (subject to weak semantic restructions), meta-logical
          predicates, second-order predicates, etc.

   HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which predicate
   symbols can be variable or structured.  This allows unification to be
   performed on the predicate symbols themselves in addition to the
   arguments of the predicates.

   XSB's HiLog implementation:

       o  Includes a fully integrated HiLog preprocessor. HiLog terms can
          be used anywhere in XSB, including the interpreter level.

       o  Provides a number of meta-logical standard predicates for
          HiLog terms.

   Compiler optimizations for HiLog terms are currently under development.

Name:         OL(P)

Summary:      Object Layer for Prolog

Version:      1.1 (23-JUN-93)

Description: 

   OL(P), Object Layer for Prolog, is an object-oriented extension to
   Prolog.  It provides an object-oriented structuring and reuse
   mechanism for Prolog in a manner that preserves performance and
   semantics. The object-oriented layer is compiled into Prolog without
   introducing any side-effects.  OL(P) takes the view of objects as
   collections of predicates (called methods).  To Prolog, OL(P) adds
   objects with methods, data encapsulation, instances, and multiple
   inheritance. Object methods can access Prolog predicates and vice
   versa. The OL(P) incremental compiler translates OL(P) programs to
   Prolog programs that don't need runtime interpretation (e.g., no
   search is needed for inheritance).  OL(P) comes with source code,
   documentation, simple built-in project management, some libraries,
   and example programs.

Description: 

   POEM (Prolog Object-Oriented Embedded Manager) is a simple
   object-oriented programming package for Prolog. It includes notions of
   classes, objects, and subclasses, similar to Simula-67.  There is no
   error detection mechanism.

   POEM comes from a Poplog Users' Group tape in early 1987. (The
   original code is from 1985.) This version includes some small changes
   to improve portability suggested by Nick Youd of Cambridge
   University's Engineering Department.

Name:         Literate Prolog

Summary:      LaTeX macros for including Prolog code in documents.

Version:      24-FEB-93

Description: 

   Literate Prolog (latex2pl) allows the user to include Prolog code in
   LaTeX documents. The Prolog code is included between \begin{prolog}
   and \end{prolog} commands. These sections are typeset in Courier to
   distinguish them from the surrounding text. The commands
   \begin{prologdisplay} and \end{prologdisplay} are like the verbatim
   environment, except that the text is typeset in Courier Italic to
   identify it as Prolog code that is not necessarily executable. Smaller
   sections of Prolog text can be typeset using the {\pl ...} and 
   {\pli ...} commands, the latter being "Prolog italic".

   The author did not use Web, because the formatting commands are
   cryptic and Prolog doesn't need the same code reordering as Pascal and C.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/prolog/util/ptags/

Name:         PTAGS

Summary:      Creates a tags file from Prolog sources

Version:      5-MAR-89

Description: 

   Ptags creates a tags file for the Prolog predicates as defined in the
   source files supplied as input. Its use is analogous to that of
   ctags(1).  Like ctags, output is sent to a file called tags in the
   current directory.  Each line in the tags file contains three
   tab-separated fields: the first is the name of each predicate defined
   in the source files; the second is the name of the file where the
   predicate is defined; and the third is an instruction to be executed
   by vi(1) or ex(1) to find the definition within the source file.  As
   with ctags, the tags file is sorted alphabetically by predicate name.

Summary:      CMU Scheme Repository

Description:

   Welcome to the Scheme Repository.

   The Scheme Repository at CMU is part of the CMU Artificial Intelligence
   Repository. The goal of the Scheme Repository is to collect files and
   programs of general interest to Scheme programmers. Information
   files include the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) postings for the
   comp.lang.scheme newsgroup and copies of the RnRS standards for scheme.

   Thanks to Ozan S. Yigit, creator of the Internet Scheme Repository,
   for assistance in gathering materials for the Scheme section of the
   CMU AI Repository.

   This is NOT a precise mirror of the Internet Scheme Repository. Some
   of the materials have been relocated to more appropriate locations in
   the AI Repository. We also have some additional materials not
   currently present in the Internet Scheme Repository, and changed the
   organization significantly.

   If this is the first time you have used the Repository, please read
   this file and the file named readme.txt. The file readme.txt contains
   important information concerning the repository and conditions on use
   of the repository. By retrieving files from the repository, you
   signify your agreement to these conditions.

   To contribute files to the repository, first see section [7] of the
   readme.txt file. Then send mail to ai+scheme@cs.cmu.edu. If
   possible, please put the files in ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/new/.

Origin:       ftp.cs.cmu.edu:user/ai/lang/scheme/  [128.2.206.173]
              Give "anonymous" (without the quotes) at the username:
              prompt and type your email address (in the form "user@host")
              at the password: prompt. NOTE: There is *no* leading slash
              before user/ai/lang/scheme/; just type "cd user/ai/lang/scheme/"
              at the ftp> prompt.

              If you will be transferring compressed files, be sure to
              type the "binary" command before retrieving the files. The
              "get" command is used to get a single file, and "mget" to
              retrieve multiple files using wildcards.  If you're using
              the "mget" command, you might want to turn off prompting
              first by using the "prompt" command.

              The Lisp Utilities Repository is kept in the Andrew File
              System (AFS) directory
              /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/scheme/
              and its subdirectories. If your site runs AFS, you can
              just cd to this directory and copy the files directly.
              (The FTP location given above is just a link to the AFS
              directory.)

      "Essentials of Programming Languages", MIT Press/McGraw-Hill, 1992.
      536 pages, ISBN 0-262-06145-7.

   EOPL teaches fundamental concepts of programming language design by
   using small interpreters as examples. The book covers most of the
   features of Scheme. It includes a discussion of parameter passing
   techniques, object oriented languages, and techniques for transforming
   interpreters to allow their implementation in terms of any low-level
   language.  Also discussed are scanners, parsers, and the derivation of
   a compiler and virtual machine from an interpreter.

   SAP introduces the basic concepts of programming in Scheme. The book
   also deals with object oriented programming, co-routining,
   continuations.  It gives numerous examples. SAP has more of an
   emphasis on teaching Scheme than SICP, and can be seen as an
   alternative to SICP.

      and McGraw-Hill (New York), 1985.  542 pages. ISBN 0-262-01077-1.

   The book starts off introductory, but rapidly gets into powerful
   Lisp-particular constructs, such as using closures and engines,
   building interpreters, compilers and object-oriented systems.  Often
   referred to by its acronym, SICP, which is pronounced "Sick-Pee". This
   is the classical text for teaching program design using Scheme,
   and everybody should read it at least once.

Description: 

   With PSD, the portable Scheme debugger, you can do source code
   debugging for any R4RS compliant Scheme interpreter when run in a GNU
   Emacs buffer (either version 18 or 19). PSD lets you set and clear
   breakpoints, single step evaluation, follow execution in an editor
   window, and examine and change a program's variables. You can also let
   a program run until an error occurs, and then examine the state of the
   program. It works by instrumenting the original source code, so it
   should run with any R4RS compliant Scheme.  Includes documentation and

Package:      lang/scheme/code/debug/sclint/

Name:         SCLINT

Summary:      A lint-like program for Scheme.

Version:      0.9 (8-MAR-93)

Description: 

   SCLINT is a lint-like program for Scheme. It checks for consistency of
   indentation, syntax of special forms, and the number of arguments to
   primitive and most user-defined procedures. This is not a full
   implementation, but rather a quick hack. It is used in teaching
   programming at the Tampere University of Technology.

Package:      lang/scheme/code/debug/xscheme/

Name:         XScheme

Summary:      Graphical Scheme debugger

Version:      0.2

Description: 

   XScheme is a graphical Scheme debugger based on STk (Scheme Tk
   interface) and was developed for cs169 Software Engineering class of
   1994 at University of California at Berkeley.

   The features of this release include:

     *  Breakpoints on any subexpression of a closure -- stop evaluation
        before that subexpression is evaluated.  Set break, remove break
        enable/disable break operations can be done both interactively from
        Break point manager window, Expression viewer or scheme prompt, as
        well as from code.

     *  Self-evaluating watch expressions, that provide monitoring of 
        arbitrary expressions with various scope and evaluation options.

     *  Abitily to install custom viewers that provide a specialized
        view at any scheme data. These viewers must confirm to a
        common interface and can be attached to any watch expression
        so the value of that watch expression is displayed with this
        specified viewer. 

     *  A number of viewer is provided with this release:

          -  expression viewer, shows data in textual notation, pretty
                                printed with color coded keywords.

          -  Box-n-Pointer Viewer, shows data in Box and Pointer
                                notation, with a cons cell represented
                                as a box with two pointers for car and cdr.

          -  Environment Viewer, a specialized viewer to display the
                                current binings of any given
                                environment, and its parent environments.

     *  Evaluation Monitor: provides display of the location of
        evaluation when a breakpoint occurs and displays current
        local bindings at that point. 

     *  Help system. It provides a set of indexed entries that can be
        expanded easily by loading a new text module and regestering.
        Help screens can use custom fonts, sizes and formatting. No
        colors are supported yet, but can be added with minimum effort.

Summary:      Implementation of resources (weak pools) for Scheme.

Version:      

Description: 

   This is an implementation of resources for Scheme. Rather than rely
   on the garbage collector, it provides pools of objects which can be
   reused. When you need an object, it allocates one from the pool,

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/code/ext/strings/char_set/

Name:         Character Sets

Summary:      Implementation of character sets in Scheme.

Version:      26-MAY-93

Description: 

   A character set is, as its name might suggest, a set for storing
   characters.  Such sets are often particularly useful in string
   processing applications.  The reason for treating sets of characters
   in a special manner is that until the advent of UNICODE and ISO ???,
   character sets only contained a maximum of 255 characters and so this
   fact could be taken advantage of in an implementation.  The usual
   approach being to store a character set as a bit set.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/code/ext/strings/conc_str/

Name:         Conc-String

Summary:      Strings for efficient concatenation.

Version:      1.8 (22-SEP-92)

Description: 

   CONC-STRING is a form of string that supports efficient concatenation.
   This allows purely functional code to be written without the overhead
   associated with the append operation in conventional strings.  Of
   course, there is no such thing as a free lunch, this efficiency is
   achieved by removing the worst case O(1) time for accessing a
   character in the string. Conc-strings are implemented as binary
   trees with some redundant information.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/code/ext/strings/read_str/

Name:         

Summary:      Unpack integers from a string.

Version:      03 (21-MAY-93)

Description: 

   This directory contains routines to unpack various sized integers
   (8,16,24,32 bit) from a string.  The routines are a cross between
   string->integer with a radix of 255 and part of Perl's unpack
   facility.  Only the unsigned routines are really necessary, the others
   can be synthesised from them.  They are only included here for
   historical reasons.  Note that the numbers are extracted in network
   (big endian) order.

Package:      lang/scheme/code/ext/types/soft_scm/

Name:         Soft Scheme

Summary:      Practical soft type system for Scheme.

Version:      0.08 (11-JAN-94)

Description: 

   Soft Scheme provides the benefits of static typing for dynamically
   typed Scheme.  Like a static type checker, a soft type checker infers
   types for variables and expressions.  But rather than reject programs
   containing untypable fragments, a soft type checker inserts explicit
   run-time checks to transform untypable programs to typable form.
   These run-time checks indicate potential program errors, enabling
   programmers to detect errors prior to program execution.  Soft type
   checking minimizes the number of run-time checks in the compiled code,
   enabling dynamically typed languages to attain the efficiency of
   statically typed languages like ML.

   supported, with the possible exception of spotty support for text and
   image data. There also isn't any Scheme support for the datetime
   datatype -- dates and times must be supplied to SQL as a string and
   returned to Scheme in a CONVERT()ed column as a string.  There is
   no Scheme datetime datatype.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/bigloo/

Name:         Bigloo

Summary:      A Scheme to C compiler and interpreter

Version:      Bigloo 1.6c (9-JUN-94); Camloo 0.2 (9-JUN-94)

Description: 

   BIGLOO is a Scheme interpreter and compiler. It conforms to the
   IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE P1178) with some extensions, such as
   regular expression parsing (RGC), a lexical analyzer generator, a full
   foreign function interface, and a pattern matching compiler.  Bigloo
   can also compile modules written in Caml (an ML dialect), letting you
   mix Scheme, ML, and C.  Object-oriented programming is provided by
   Meroon v3. The main goal of Bigloo is to deliver small and fast stand
   alone applications.  Bigloo produces ANSI C and hence should be easy
   to port. 

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/elk/

Name:         Elk

Summary:      Extension Language Kit interpreter for Scheme

Version:      2.2 (9-FEB-94)

Description: 

   Elk (Extension Language Kit) is a Scheme interpreter designed to be
   used as a general extension language for applications written in C or
   C++. Elk can also be used as a stand-alone implementation of the
   Scheme programming language. It is mostly R4RS and P1178 conformant
   (with the exception of the number system and a few minor details).  It
   has interfaces to Xlib, Xt, and the Athena and OSF/Motif widget sets.
   It includes dynamic incremental linking of C object files, an
   optional foreign function interface, and a generational garbage
   collector. Elk can also freeze a fully customized application into a
   new executable file. Other features include a simple macro
   facility, environments as first-class objects, dynamic-wind,
   fluid-let, autoloading, and provide/require.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/gambit/

Name:         Gambit Scheme

Summary:      An optimizing Scheme compiler.

Version:      2.0 (5-FEB-93)

Description: 

   Gambit is an optimizing Scheme compiler/system. It conforms to the
   IEEE-Scheme standard (IEEE P1178) and the Revised^4 Report on Scheme
   (R4RS). The system supports the whole numeric tower (i.e. integer,
   rational, real and complex numbers). It also has several extensions to
   the standards including: weak pairs, string ports, property lists,
   futures, pretty printer, debugger, compiler and multitasking.  The
   distribution contains the interpreter and optimizing native code
   compiler and all the sources required to build the system (the sources
   for MacGambit are for THINK-C 5.0). MacGambit's specific features
   include: a Scheme interface to several Toolbox routines (mostly
   QuickDraw), a drawing window for simple graphics, an online help
   system containing R4RS and a Scheme oriented editor with an emacs
   compatibility mode.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/help/

Version:      1.4 (12-JAN-93)

Description: 

   HELP (a lazy Scheme) is a complete and efficient Scheme-like
   functional lazy Lisp interpreter. It has a 'friendly' interface
   (parenthesis matcher, auto-indent), uses a full call-by-need semantics
   and includes many examples, including a symbolic compiler for the
   680x0. Efficiency is good and the laziness is fully parametrizable (you
   may turn Help into a strict Scheme-like language if you like). French
   AND English updated docs are included in Word4 and plain text formats.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/pcscheme/geneva/

Name:         PCS/Geneva

Summary:      Reimplementation of PC Scheme by Univ. of Geneva.

Version:      4.02PL1 (11-JAN-94)

Description: 

   PCS/Geneva is a Scheme interpreter/compiler developed at the
   University of Geneva. It is based on Texas Instrument's PC Scheme
   (version 3.03) but differs somewhat from the original. The main
   extensions to PC Scheme are 486 support, BGI graphics, LIM-EMS
   pagination support, line editing, mouse support, assembly-level
   interfacing, and several powerful Scheme-oriented editors. (TI's PC
   Scheme gives users full Revised^3 support along with many primitives
   for DOS, Graphics and Text Windows. A powerful built-in optimizing
   compiler produces fast code.)

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/pcscheme/pcs/

Name:         PC Scheme

Summary:      Scheme implementation for IBM PCs

Version:      3.03

Description: 

   PC-Scheme is a Scheme implementation originally written by Texas
   Instruments.  This directory contains the version made freely
   distributable by TI. Note that the public version wasn't as
   powerful as the commercial version, which costs $95 and includes a
   reference manual and user guide. [The commercialized version is no
   longer available. See the note about Ibuki purchasing the rights below.]

   PC Scheme includes an optimizing compiler, an emacs-like editor,
   inspector, debugger, performance testing, foreign function interface,
   window system and an object-oriented subsystem.  Conforms to the
   Revised^3 Report on Scheme. Also supports the dialect used in Abelson
   and Sussman's SICP.

   NOTE: Ibuki announced on July 13, 1992, that it has purchased the
   rights to PC Scheme from TI and intends to make it also available on
   486 PCs and under Windows 3.1. This version should be better than
   either of the public versions and will be supported by Ibuki. For

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/pixie/

Name:         Pixie Scheme

Summary:      R3RS-compatible Scheme for the Macintosh

Version:      May, 1990

Description: 

   Pixie Scheme is an implementation of a Scheme interpreter for the
   Macintosh with nearly complete coverage of R3RS. The interpreter is
   very slow. It also has limited numeric types, with no numeric types
   beyond 32-bit integer and 32-bit and 80-bit floats. 

   The distribution includes two program versions (one uses
   68020 / 68881 code, the other runs on a straight MC68000) and
   a HyperCard help stack.

   Pixie Scheme is distributed as shareware; the author would be
   delighted to receive a one dollar donation from each user.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/pseudo/

Name:         Pseudo Scheme

Summary:      Scheme implemented on top of Common Lisp.

Version:      2.9 (20-MAY-93)

Description: 

   PseudoScheme is an implementation of Scheme written in Common Lisp.
   It works by running the Scheme code through a preprocessor, which
   generates Common Lisp code. It is well integrated with Common Lisp in
   that Scheme and Common Lisp programs are directly intercallable.
   Scheme programs can be executed using the Common Lisp evaluator or
   compiler because Lisp sees Scheme special forms as macros that invoke
   the translator.  Pseudoscheme does not support first-class
   continuations (CALL/CC isn't as general as in a true Scheme), and
   it has only partial support for tail recursion and the number
   system, but beyond these limitations it scrupulously implements all
   of IEEE (and Revised^4) Scheme.  It also provides an implementation
   of the new "hygienic" high-level macro facility (Clinger and Rees,
   POPL '91).

Description: 

   Scheme 8088 (s88) is a Scheme implementation for the 8088 (PC).  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scheme2c/

Name:         Scheme->C

Summary:      Scheme implementation that compiles Scheme into C.

Version:      15-MAR-93

Description: 

   Scheme->C is an R4RS compliant Scheme system that is centered around
   a compiler that compiles Scheme to C. The C code is then compiled
   by the native C compiler for the target machine. This design results
   in a portable and efficient system that allows either stand-alone
   Scheme programs or programs written in a mix of compiled and
   interpreted Scheme and compiled code from C, C++ and other languages.  

   Besides the base language, the system includes "expansion passing
   style" macros, a foreign function call capability, records, weak
   pointers, three X11 interfaces, call/cc, and a generational,
   conservative, copying garbage collector. Numbers are represented
   internally as 30-bit integers (62-bit integers on Alpha AXP), or 64-bit
   floating point values.

   The system is oriented towards block compilation to generate code
   which can run in standalone programs which may include code from
   other languages.  While debugging is typically done using the
   interpreter, it will never be considered a "Scheme environment".

   The compiler is written in Scheme.  Most of the runtime system
   (including an interpreter) is written in Scheme.  The generational garbage
   collector and a few other things are written in C.  There is a small
   (< 100) amount of assembly code.

   The system has three different interfaces to X11, all written in
   Scheme. All are available gatekeeper (see Origin below).  The first is
   a complete set of stubs to Xlib included in the base system.  The
   second is an alternative to Xlib called SCIX, found in
   pub/X11/contrib.  The third, ezd, allows programs to easily produce
   interactive, structured graphics and is found in pub/DEC/ezd.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scheme48/

Name:         Scheme48

Summary:      Portable and efficient implementation of Scheme.

Version:      0.36 (22-MAR-94)

Description: 

   Scheme 48 is a Scheme implementation based on a virtual machine
   architecture. Scheme 48 is designed to be straightforward, flexible,
   reliable, and fast. It should be easily portable to 32-bit
   byte-addressed machines that have POSIX and ANSI C support.

   In addition to the usual Scheme built-in procedures and a development
   environment, library software includes support for hygienic macros (as
   described in the Revised^4 Scheme report), multitasking, records,
   exception handling, hash tables, arrays, weak pointers, and FORMAT.

   Scheme 48 implements and exploits an experimental module system
   loosely derived from Standard ML and Scheme Xerox.  The development
   environment supports interactive changes to modules and interfaces.
   This feature makes the module system significantly easier to work with
   than it would be otherwise.

   The virtual machine executes a byte-code instruction set similar to
   the target of the Scheme 311 compiler [Clinger, LFP 1984].  The
   interpreter for the virtual instruction set is itself written in
   Pre-Scheme, a systems programming dialect of Scheme.  A Pre-Scheme
   compiler applies intensive source-to-source rewrites to the
   interpreter source code and emits low-level C code.  When the output
   is then compiled by an optimizing C compiler such as gcc, the result
   is an efficient and portable emulator.

   The virtual machine is initialized from a specified memory image
   containing byte-compiled Scheme code and data.  Images, including
   small stand-alone applications, are built either using a static linker
   or by writing out a procedure from an executing program.  A standard
   memory image contains a Scheme run-time library (APPEND, READ, WRITE,
   etc.), a compiler from Scheme to the virtual instruction set, and a
   command processor and debugger.  In this way Scheme 48 can be
   configured to look like a conventional Lisp interpreter.

   The Pre-Scheme compiler, which produces scheme48vm.c from vm/*.scm, is
   distributed separately.  For information contact
   kelsey@research.nj.nec.com.

   This is a BETA release.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scheme88/

Name:         Scheme88

Summary:      Scheme84 ported to Common Lisp.

Version:      0.4 (28-JUL-91)

Description: 

   Scheme88 is a re-implementation of Indiana University's Scheme84
   to run in Common Lisp. The port was developed at the Rice University
   Department of Computer Science.

   Major improvements include
      (1) the inclusion of a correct hygienic macro expander for
          Kohlbecker's extend-syntax [0, 1];

      (2) the inclusion of new control operators, namely, F to grab
          FUNCTIONAL continuations, and RUN (or the syntactic abbreviation #>),
          to delimit the extent of control operations [2, 3];

      (3) an on-line help facility that provides simple descriptions of

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scm/hobbit/

Name:         Hobbit

Summary:      Compiler for SCM code.

Version:      3

Description: 

   HOBBIT is a small compiler for Scheme. It compiles Scheme programs
   to C, and is intended to be used with Aubrey Jaffer's SCM scheme
   interpreter. It treats SCM as a C library and integrates compiled
   functions into SCM as new primitives. The main aim
   of Hobbit is to produce maximally fast C programs which retain
   most of the original Scheme program structure, making the output C
   program readable and modifiable. Hobbit is written in Scheme and is
   able to compile itself. 

   Hobbit imposes strong restrictions on the higher-order features of
   Scheme. For example, it does not support continuations, it does not
   allow the return of closures by functions or function redefinition, 
   and doesn't support CALL/CC, APPLY, FORCE, and DELAY.

   The compiler uses lambda-lifting instead of closures.

   If you find Hobbit useful, please support the development and
   maintenance of Hobbit by sending money to Tanel.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/scm/wb/

Name:         WB

Summary:      Database package which may be used with SCM.

Version:      1a2

Description: 

   WB is a disk based, sorted associative array (B-tree) C library. These
   associative arrays consist of variable length (less that 256 bytes)
   keys and values.  

   Using WB, large databases can be created and managed from SCM. 

   Basic operations are creation, destruction, opening and closing of 
   diskfiles and arrays, insertion, deletion, retrieval, successor, and
   predecessor (with respect to dictionary order of keys).  Functional
   application of find-next, deletion, and modification over a range of
   consecutive key values is supported. Multiple associative arrays
   can be stored in one disk file. Simultaneous access to multiple
   disk files is supported.  A structure checker, garbage collector
   are included.  A repair program and ram-disk type file (for
   temporary structures) are in development. The current WB
   implementation has a file size limit of 2^32 * block size (default
   2048) = 2^43 bytes (8796 Gbytes). WB does its own memory and disk
   management.

Package:      lang/scheme/impl/similix/

Name:         Similix

Summary:      Self-Applicable Partial Evaluator for a Subset of Scheme.

Version:      5.0 (May 1993)

Description: 

   Similix is an autoprojector (self-applicable partial evaluator) for a
   large higher-order subset of the strict functional language Scheme.
   Similix treats source programs that use a limited class of
   side-effects, for instance input/output operations. Similix handles
   partially static data structures.

   Similix is automatic: in general, no user annotations (such as
   unfolding information) are required; user assistance may in some cases
   be required to avoid looping, however. Similix gives certain
   guarantees concerning the residual programs it generates: computations
   are never discarded (partial evaluation thus preserves termination
   properties) and never duplicated.

   Similix is well-suited for partially evaluating interpreters that use
   environments represented as functions and interpreters written in
   continuation passing style. Since Similix is self-applicable,
   stand-alone compilers can be generated from interpreters.

   Similix is highly portable. It conforms to the IEEE and R4RS Scheme
   standards, but it also runs under R3RS Scheme.

Description: 

   STk is a R4RS Scheme interpreter which can access the Tk graphical
   package. All of the commands defined by the Tk toolkit are available
   to the STk interpreter, and Tk variables are reflected back into
   Scheme as Scheme variables. Callback is expressed in Scheme. Includes
   a CLOS-like OO extension called STklos, which provides multiple
   inheritance, generic functions, multi methods, and a true meta-object
   protocol.  A set of classes have been defined to manipulate Tk
   commands (menu, buttons, scales, canvas, canvas items) as Scheme
   objects. 

   Based in part on SIOD.

Package:      lang/scheme/util/lisp2tex/

Name:         Lisp2TeX

Summary:      For inserting Scheme/Lisp code in TeX files.

Version:      4-FEB-94

Description: 

   LiSP2TeX is a system that allows easy insertions of Scheme, or Lisp,
   code towards TeX files. The originality of LiSP2TeX is that it
   extracts Scheme definitions from the files where they appear and wraps
   them appropriately within TeX macros for insertion into the
   documentation file. LiSP2TeX decorrelates writing documentation from
   programming: it is therefore possible to separately develop programs
   and documentations and to merge them at the end to produce up to date
   final documents. LiSP2TeX also has some pretty-printing capabilities
   to produce denotations full of greek letters. 

   Documentation is included in the distribution.

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/util/scm_tex/

Name:         SchemeTeX

Summary:      Simple support for literate programming in Scheme.

Version:      1.3 (30-JUN-88)

Description: 

   SchemeTeX is a Unix filter that translates schemeTeX source into LaTeX
   source.  Originally developed for the Scheme dialect of Lisp, it can
   easily be used with most other dialects.

Package:      lang/scheme/util/slatex/

Name:         SLaTeX

Summary:      Allows you to include Scheme/Lisp code `as is' in LaTeX
              and TeX source.

Version:      2.2 (20-JAN-94)

Description: 

   SLaTeX is a R4RS-compliant Scheme program that allows you to write
   program code "as is" in your LaTeX or TeX source.  It is particularly
   geared to the programming languages Scheme and Common Lisp. The
   formatting of the code includes assigning appropriate fonts to the
   various tokens in the code (keywords, variables, constants, data), at
   the same time retaining the proper indentation when going to the
   non-monospace (non-typewriter) provided by TeX.  SLaTeX comes with two
   databases that recognize the standard keywords/variables/constants of
   Scheme and Common Lisp respectively.  These can be modified by the
   user using easy TeX commands.  In addition, the user can inform SLaTeX
   to typeset arbitrary identifiers as specially suited TeX expressions
   (i.e., beyond just fonting them).  

===========================================================================

Package:      lang/scheme/util/sweb/

Name:         SchemeWEB

Summary:      Simple literate programming utility for Lisp, that lets you
              generate Lisp and LaTeX code from the same source file.

Version:      2.0 (25-FEB-94)

Description: 

   SchemeWEB provides simple support for literate programming in Lisp.
   SchemeWEB version 2.0 is a Unix filter that allows you to generate
   both Lisp and LaTeX code from one source file.  The generated LaTeX
   code formats Lisp programs in typewriter font obeying the spacing in
   the source file.  Comments can include arbitrary LaTeX commands.
   SchemeWEB was originally developed for the Scheme dialect of Lisp, but
   it can easily be used with most other dialects.  

   A SchemeWEB file is a Lisp source file which contains code sections
   and comment sections, but each section is identified in a novel way.
   A code section begins with a line whose first character is a left
   parenthesis.  It continues until a line is found which contains the
   parenthesis that matches the one which started the code section.  The
   remaining lines of text in the source file are treated as comments.

Package:      lang/st/impl/gnu/

Name:         GNU Smalltalk

Summary:      GNU's implementation of Smalltalk

Version:      Unix version 1.1.1 (15-SEP-91); DOS version 1.1.1 (12-SEP-93)

Description: 

   A free and portable C implementation of Smalltalk, from the folks at GNU.

   GNU Smalltalk attempts to be a reasonably faithful implementation of
   Smalltalk-80 as described in the "Blue Book", also know as
   "Smalltalk-80, the Language and its Implementation", by Adele Goldberg
   and David Robson.  The syntax that the language accepts and the byte
   codes that the virtual machine interprets are exactly as they appear
   in the Blue Book.  Most of the primitives are the same as well,
   although due to the differing nature of the implementation some of the
   primitives haven't been implemented, and other new ones have been.

   GNU Smalltalk includes an incremental garbage collector, binary image
   save capability, C-callout (allows Smalltalk to invoke user-written C
   code and pass parameters to it), GNU Emacs editing mode, optional byte
   code compilation tracing and byte code execution tracing,
   automatically loaded per-user initialization files, and STIX (the
   SmallTalk Interface to X).

Summary:        ISO-9660 CD-ROM Utilities

Version:        1.1

Description:

  Bill Siegmund dug into the ISO-9660 documentation and pulled out enough
  information to write some low-level user-mode code for reading ISO-9660
  discs.  Rich Morin tweaked the code a bit and added some shell scripts as
  frosting.  Neither Bill nor Rich is totally happy with the results, but
  they agree that it is far better than nothing, and give it to you as a
  starting point, tool, or what have you.

===========================================================================

Package:      util/gzip/

Name:         GZIP

Summary:      Compression Program

Version:      1.2.4

Description: 

   GZIP is a compression program from the Free Software Foundation.
   GZIP uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm (LZ77), and generally achieves
   better compression than LZW (compress), Huffman coding (pack) and
   adaptive Huffman coding (compact), and is patent free. Implementations
   exist for VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Atari, Unix, and Macintosh.

   The standard extension for GZIP files is ".gz". GZIP is backward
   compatible with compress, so it will also expand ".Z" files.

   Extensions:
       gz               Gzipped text or data file
       dgz              Gzipped DVI file
       pgz              Gzipped PostScript file
       sgz              Gzipped shell archive
