This file contains a template for a copyright notice you may wish to
use, if you don't want to put your program into the public domain or
use the GNU GPL. 

You may wish to make the following changes:

  [a]  replace the word "material" with "software and its documentation"
       to be more specific. 

  [b]  add the sentence
          "Individuals or organizations wishing to commercialize the
           software or to incorporate the software into a commercial
           product may apply to <organization> for separate licensing."
       to section 3.

  [c]  As it stands, this license template restricts the
       commercialization of the software. If you wish to further
       restrict the software to non-commercial purposes, add the
       phrase "for any non-commercial purpose" after the word
       "granted" in the paragraph beginning "Permission ...".
       We do not recommend doing this, since for many folks the
       restrictions against commercialization suffice.

  [d]  You may wish to add the following paragraph in some form to the
       license: 

	 7. Users of this software hereby grant back to <organization>
	    a non-exclusive, unrestricted, royalty-free right and license
	    under any changes, enhancements or extensions made to the
	    core functions of the software, including but not limited to
	    those affording compatibility with other hardware or software
	    environments, but excluding applications which incorporate
	    this software.  Users further agree to use their best efforts
	    to return to <organization> any such changes, enhancements or
	    extensions that they make.
