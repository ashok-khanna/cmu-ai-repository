This is a publicly-accessible distribution site for JAIR, the Journal
of Artificial Intelligence Research. See the file help.doc for a description
of JAIR, general information, and "Frequently Asked Questions".

The subdirectory "information" contains a variety of information sheets,
including submission information, formatting information, an author index
and a complete table of contents.

The subdirectory "volume1" contains the articles that are being
published in Volume 1. As additional articles are published, that
directory will continue growing, until we start on Volume 2. The
articles are published in PostScript. The source files (excluding
figures) for each article can be found in volume1/sources.
