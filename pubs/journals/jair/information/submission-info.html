This information sheet is for authors interested in submitting to
JAIR.  As the journal is still evolving, some aspects of this document
are incomplete. Also, the policies described here are not cast in
stone.  This is the first fully-refereed electronic journal in
artificial intelligence and we expect to learn some things as we begin
publishing.  That's why this is a "working document".

                        I - ABOUT JAIR

General information about JAIR is available by anonymous FTP from
P.GP.CS.CMU.EDU in the file /usr/jair/pub/help.doc or
from FTP.MRG.DIST.UNIGE.IT in the file pub/jair/pub/help.doc.
It can also be obtained by sending a message to jair@cs.cmu.edu
with the subject "autorespond" and the body "help". Or you can
contact jair-ed@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov if you prefer to correspond
with a human being (but please try to use the automated methods first).


			II - SUBMISSIONS


JAIR will only publish articles of the highest quality.  Submissions
will be evaluated on their originality and significance.  We invite
submissions in all areas of AI, including automated reasoning,
cognitive modeling, knowledge representation, learning, natural
language, neural networks, perception, and robotics.

We strongly encourage authors to be concise.  Short, high-quality
articles will be welcomed, in addition to the more lengthy articles that
traditionally appear in AI journals.  JAIR will also publish technical
notes -- very brief papers that extend or evaluate previous work.

Both articles and technical notes may be accompanied by online
appendices containing data, instructions for obtaining source code, or
the source code itself (if appropriate).  We strongly encourage
authors to submit such appendices along with their papers.  (Note: if
an online appendix contains source code, we will require you to sign a
release form prior to publication to reduce our potential liability.)

Authors should describe work that is interesting to a broad spectrum
of AI researchers, including theoreticians and system builders.  All
claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical
experiments or theoretical analyses.  When appropriate, authors are
encouraged to implement their work and to demonstrate its utility on
significant problems; any experiments reported should be reproducible.
Papers describing systems should clearly describe the contributions or
the principles underlying the system. Papers describing theoretical
results should also discuss their practical utility.  In general, it
should be clear how the work advances the current state of
understanding and why the advance matters.  Papers should report on
what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was
done.

Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their
predecessors.  If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques,
it should also explain why current terminology or techniques are
insufficient.  (Authors should not needlessly reinvent terminology and
techniques.)

Submissions must be original.  The work cannot have previously been
published in another journal, and submissions cannot be under review,
or pending publication, by another journal.  We will, however, publish
work that has previously been reported in conferences or workshops.  If
the work has appeared in an "archival" conference, such as AAAI or
IJCAI, we would expect the submission to extend the conference paper;
normally we will not publish the conference paper as is.

If a paper is accepted, the editor and reviewers may require minor
revisions.  The author should return the revised paper as soon as
possible.  Normally we expect revisions to be completed in 3 months or
less.  Upon receiving a revised paper, the editor may ask the reviewers
to re-review the revised paper. 

If a paper requires substantial revisions, it will not be accepted.
In this case, the editor may recommend that the author submit a
revised version, but there is no guarantee it will be published.
A paper may be revised and resubmitted at most once.

After a paper is accepted, authors will be required to transfer
copyright of the article to the publishers.  The article cannot be
reprinted in another publication without the publisher's permission.



	                   The Review Process

To promote rapid publication of research results, articles sent to
JAIR will be reviewed and returned to the authors in approximately six
weeks.  If an article is longer than usual, or the article is submitted
prior to a major conference (IJCAI, AAAI or the main conference in the
subfield for which the article is intended), we may require more time
for the review.  In this case, authors will be notified of the required
review period by email after we receive their article.

Normally, authors will be given up to three months to accomplish their
revisions.  Electronic publication will occur immediately after we
receive the final version of an accepted article.

Our plans for a rapid turnaround time on reviewing/publication are a
considerable departure from the standard practice in current AI
journals, where articles are often published more than two years after
their initial submission.  We have modified the standard reviewing
procedure in several respects in order to speed up the process.  For
instance, the process will be conducted via electronic communication
whenever possible.  Also, editorial board members have agreed to
review papers within the required deadlines.  Nevertheless, to be
successful, we also require the help of additional reviewers who support
our goals.

The editorial board is listed at the end of this document.  Membership
on the editorial board is a two-year commitment.  


	                   Formatting

Authors are responsible for formatting their papers in PostScript.
(Professional services are available if the author does not have the
proper software.)  JAIR will electronically distribute multiple
versions of a paper, including a PostScript version and an ASCII text
version.  The text version will normally be the source file used to
create the PostScript version (e.g., a Latex file), and need not
include the figures since we assume it will be used primarily for text
search.  However, since authors are responsible for formatting, they
are welcome to prepare additional versions of their paper and we will
distribute them.  For example, an author might decide to distribute a
PostScript file, a latex file, and a plain text file with diagrams.

Authors should submit a PostScript file, an ASCII text file containing
the abstract, and if they wish, a source file.  After a paper is
accepted, authors will be given formatting instructions and a sample
paper.  In addition, we will distribute macros for several different
document preparation systems, including Latex and FrameMaker.
(Authors may request the formatting instructions and macros prior to
submission. We also plan to issue guidelines for producing PostScript
files so that they will be compatible with most printers/previewers.)
The editorial staff will assist in the final preparation, but the
primary responsibility for proper formatting lies with the author.
The editorial staff can recommend professionals who will provide this
service for a fee.

			To Submit

To submit a paper authors should email the following to
jair-editor@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov:
   - a cover letter which includes the authors' email and physical addresses.
   - an ascii text file containing the abstract of the paper. Also
     include the authors' names and their email addresses.
   - a PostScript file containing the paper.  The first page of the paper
     should include the title and the authors' names and  email addresses.
   - (optionally) a source file (e.g Latex file). If there are
      multiple source files, such as files containing figures, just mail the
      main source file.  If there is no single source file that makes sense
      to mail, or there is no readily available source file for your
      document prepration system, don't worry about it.
   - (optionally) files containing online appendices.

Each of the above should be mailed in a separate message.  If the
Postscript file is very large, rather than emailing it, we would
prefer if you would make the file available via anonyomous FTP, and
give us the address in your cover letter.

You should receive a reply from us confirming that we have received
your submission. If you don't get a confirmation message back within
three business days, please check with us.

If a paper includes empirical experiments, the data can be published
in an online appendix.  Similarly, source, code, or instructions for
obtaining code can also be published in an appendix.  As noted above,
we strongly encourage authors to submit such appendices along with
their paper.  For each appendix, the author should email a separate
file along with their paper.

We strongly encourage authors to use standard fonts (such as Times
Roman) in their submissions to reduce potential problems in printing
their paper.  Once a paper is accepted, authors will be required to
format their paper for publication, but this is not necessary for
submission. Nevertheless, if they wish, authors can obtain formatting
instructions and macros by anonymous FTP from P.GP.CS.CMU.EDU in the
directory /usr/jair/pub/information/format or from
FTP.MRG.DIST.UNIGE.IT in the directory pub/jair/pub/information/format.

Because of our quick turnaround time, authors may be tempted to "test
the waters" with papers that are less than they should be.  We request
that authors only submit papers that have been carefully proofread and
polished.  Papers that are clearly unacceptable will be returned
by the editor without being reviewed.

Authors must notify the editor if their submission has been previously
published elsewhere, or is submitted for publication elsewhere, during
the JAIR review/publication process, so as to ensure that JAIR's
standards for originality (see submission requirements above) are
adhered to.
