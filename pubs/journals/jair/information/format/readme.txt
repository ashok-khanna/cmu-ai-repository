This directory contains all information required to format articles
for JAIR, as well as the instructions for final preparation. If you are an
author whose article has been accepted for publication in JAIR, you *must*
read authors-guide. You will also find subdirectories for Latex, Framemaker
and Gnu's GROFF here. (We prefer that you use LaTex if possible.)
