                                     Abstract

                The  abstract is set centered and indented in 10 point
              font under the word ``Abstract'' centered  in  12  point
              bold  face  font.  The  rest of the article is set in 11
              point font.

            1.  Introduction

            A major section is introduced with the ``.sh'' command.  The
            section  header is set in 12 point bold face font. Note that
            the first paragraph following a ``.sh''  command  should  be
            set  using  the  ``.lp'' directive (so that the paragraph is
            not indented).

              Subsequent paragraphs should  be  set  using  the  ``.pp''
            directive  which  does  indent  the  paragraph.   This is an
            example.

            1.1.  Second Level Section Header

            Here is an example of a second level header also  introduced
            with  the ``.sh'' command. Notice that it is set in 11 point
            bold font rather than the 12 point bold font used in a major
            section.  Third level headings are also automatically set in
            11 point bold font.

              Here is an example of an APA-style citation  using  GREFER
            (Brooks,1975).   This  particular  citation corresponds to a
            book.  Here is another example of a citation, in  this  case
            where  more  than  one  reference  is combined into a single
            citation (McAllester,1982; Segre  &  Scharstein,1993).   The
            first  citation  in this group corresponds to a tech report,
            while the second corresponds to  a  journal  article.   Note
            that  in  every  case  the reference appears after the final
            period in the  sentence;  GREFER  will  shift  the  citation
            before the period automatically.

                                 LARRY, MOE, & CURLY



              Here   are  some  more  reference  examples  (DeJong,1988;
            Quinlan,1983).   Both  correpond  to  articles   in   edited
            volumes,  but the second has more than one editor.  Finally,
            here is an example of a short-form citation, used  when  you
            refer  to  the  authors  in the text, for example, by saying
            something like Minton (1988) describes how to use  APA-style
            citations  (this  last citation corresponds to a proceedings
            paper, as does this next one,Fisher et al.,1989).  Note that
            this  last citation has a long list of authors, and that the
            citation uses ``et al.'' to avoid listing every  author.  In
            addition,  we  made  use  of GREFER's explicit ``surrounding
            text'' feature to have the citation appear correctly  inside
            the parenthesis.

              A final word on APA-style references. The APA style manual
            devotes some 20 pages to  every  possible  configuration  of
            reference  information.  It  makes  some pretty fine-grained
            distinctions   between,   for   example,    journals    with
            sequentially  numbered  pages  and journals whose individual
            issues each start from page 1 within the same  volume.   The
            reference  style  used  here  is  meant  to come as close as
            possible to doing the right thing most of the time.1 If  you
            have some special reference needs, you may need to mess with
            the reference format a  bit;  in  particular,  the  ``refer-
            apa.me'' file.

            1.2.  Another Second Level Header

            We  have  included a GNUEMACS elisp file called ``refer.el''
            to help you set up your GREFER database. Load this file into
            EMACS,  and  then  edit  any  file ending with the extension
            ``.ref'' to enter refer-mode. This  elisp  file  provides  a
            simple interface that prompts you for the appropriate fields
            for each reference.

            2.  Another First Level Header

            In this section, we'll look at how to  incorporate  figures.
            Figures  should  be  enclosed  in ``keeps'' so that they all
            appear on the same page. We'll use a register,  ``\nF'',  to
            automatically keep track of figure numbers.




            ____________________
               1 In particular, it signals critical missing fields  with
            messages  such  as  ``NO AUTHORS??'' in the output. This, by
            the way, is an example of a footnote.




                                          2








                                    JAIR IN GROFF

















            Figure  1: Example of a GPIC figure included in the GROFF
            source.




              We expect figures to be in GPIC,  so  that  they  will  be
            sourced into the file for processing. This will be the case,
            for example, when XFIG  or  similar  drawing  programs  that
            produce GPIC output are used.  GNUPLOT is another example of
            such a program.2

              Tables are handled in a similar fashion. We expect  tables
            will be set in GTBL. We'll use another register, ``\nT'', to
            sequentially number tables. Again, use a  ``keep''  to  keep
            the table on the same page as its caption.













            ____________________
               2 Some authors may use different  drawing  programs  that
            produce postscript or encapsulated postscript figures. These
            can be included by using the PSPIC GROFF  macro  instead  of
            simply  using  the ``.so'' directive (see man page for GROPS
            for more information on how to use PSPIC).

              Notice  that  both  figure  and  table captions are set in
            regular 11 point font, like the rest of the article.

            Acknowledgements

            Acknoweldgements to people or funding agencies should appear
            here,  at  the end of the paper, just before the Appendices.
            Note the use of the ``.uh'' unnumbered section  heading  for
            the  acknowledgements;  this  type  of heading appears in 11
            point font.

            Appendix A. Sample Appendix

            Appendices are labeled sequentially  using  letters  of  the
            alphabet and appear before the references.
