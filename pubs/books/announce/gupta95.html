Multiprocessor Execution of Logic Programs 
by Gopal Gupta, New Mexico State University, USA 
 
Multiprocessor Execution of Logic Programs addresses the 
problem of efficient implementation of logic programming languages, 
specifically Prolog, on multiprocessor architectures. The approaches 
and implementations developed attempt to take full advantage of 
sequential implementation technology developed for Prolog (such as the 
WAM) while exploiting all forms of control parallelism present in 
logic programs, namely, or-parallelism, independent 
and-parallelism and dependent and-parallelism.  Coverage includes a 
thorough survey of parallel implementation techniques and parallel systems
developed for Prolog.  

Contents: 1. Introduction. Part I: Survey and Analysis of 
Parallel Execution Models. 2. Parallel Execution Models for 
Logic Programs. 3. Analysis of Or-parallel Models for Logic 
Programs. Part II: Combining Independent And- and 
Or-parallelism. 4. Environment Representation. 5. Distributed 
Stack Implementation and an Abstract Machine for And-Or Parallel 
Execution. 6. Optimizing And-Or Parallel Models. Part III: 
Extensions and Variations of the And-Or Model. 7. Integrating 
Dependent and-, Independent and-, and Or-parallelism. 8. And-Or 
Parallel Implementation of Prolog. 9. Conclusions. Bibliography. 
Index.
