            Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Announces:
         ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:  THEORY AND PRACTICE
        Thomas Dean, James Allen, and Yiannis Aloimonos

This modern introduction to AI emphasizes both the scientific 
theory and practical applications involved in developing 
systems capable of machine intelligence.  The authors discuss 
representational and computational issues in terms of their 
syntax, semantics, and computation and offer detailed 
coverage of both traditional symbolic reasoning techniques 
and alternative techniques such as neural networks and image 
processing.  They also show the implementation of algorithms 
by first using pseudocode and then Lisp code.  

To ensure that readers fully understand AI and its 
applications, the authors provide motivating examples 
throughout.  "AI in Practice" boxes appear in each chapter, 
demonstrating real-world uses of artificial intelligence by 
NASA, General Motors Corporation, and other companies.  Plus, 
Lisp Implementation appendices are found at the end of most 
chapters, providing fully-documented implementations of 
important algorithms (also available in Scheme and C++ 
implementations via ftp).
