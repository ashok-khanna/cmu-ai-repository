	Douglas Hofstadter, author of _Godel, Escher, Bach_ and the
Scientific American column and book _Metamagical Themas_, has a new
book out. While the first two books discussed a number of ideas
relevant to artificial intelligence and cognitive science, such as
recursivity and emergent behavior.
	The new book, _Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies_ writes
from a much later perspective, looking back at the models of
creativity and analogy-making that have been implemented on computers
by Doug and his graduate students, some of the issues that came up
along the way, and how they were resolved. The book is co-written by
members of Doug's research group, the Fluid Analogy Research Group
(FARG).
	The book is available through Basic Books, ISBN #
0-465-05154-5.

	Here's a table of contents to give a better idea of what FCCA
is all about:

Prologue:	The Why, the When, the Where, and the Who of This Book
Chapter 1:	To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence
Preface 2:	The Unconscious Juggling of Mental Objects
Chapter 2:	The Architecture of Jumbo
Preface 3:	Arithmetical Play and Nondeterminism
Chapter 3:	Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition
Preface 4:	The Ineradicable Eliza Effect and Its Dangers
Chapter 4:	High-level Perception, Representation, and Analogy: A
		Critique of Artificial-Intelligence Methodology
Preface 5:	Conceptual Halos and Slippability
Chapter 5:	The Copycat Project: A Model of Mental Fluidity and
		Analogy-making
Preface 6:	Two Early AI Approaches to Analogy
Chapter 6:	Perspectives on Copycat: Comparisons with Recent Work
Preface 7:	Retrieval of Old and Invention of New Analogies
Chapter 7:	Prologomena to Any Future Metacat
Preface 8:	Analogy-making in a Coffeehouse
Chapter 8:	Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto,
		Platobet
Preface 9:	The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research in AI and
		Cognitive Science
Chapter 9:	The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a
		Perception-based Model of Analogy-making
Preface 10:	The Intoxicating World of Alphabets and Their Styles
Chapter 10:	Letter Spirit: Esthetic Perception and Creative Play
		in the Rich Microcosm of the Roman Alphabet
Epilogue:	On Computers, Creativity, Credit, Brain Mechanisms,
		and the Turing Test

	I hope that the book pleases the audience as much as Doug's
earlier work has.
