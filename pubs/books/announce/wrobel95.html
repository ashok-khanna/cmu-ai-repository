Concept Formation and Knowledge Revision

Stefan Wrobel, GMD

[See http://nathan.gmd.de/persons/stefan.wrobel/kluwerbook.html]

Regarding   concepts  as   the  elementary   representational
vocabulary of  an  intelligent system,  this  book  focuses  on
representation change  as a  concept formation  task.    Taking
an interdisciplinary  approach from  psychological  foundations
to computer  implementations, Concept  Formation and  Knowledge
Revision draws  on  existing psychological  results  about  the
nature of human concepts and concept formation.  The book shows
that computational concept formation can usefully be understood
as a demand-driven  process triggered  by the  representational
needs of the learning system, and that knowledge revision  is a
suitable context for such a process.

  In  using a  first-order representation,  this  book is  part
of the rapidly developing field of Inductive  Logic Programming
(ILP). It presents a detailed analysis of the  revision problem
for first-order clausal theories, describes suitable  knowledge
revision and  concept  formation  operators,  and  demonstrates
their usefulness both theoretically and empirically within  the
learning knowledge acquisition system MOBAL.

  By  integrating computational  issues with psychological  and
fundamental discussions  of concept  formation  phenomena,  the
book will be of interest to a wide spectrum of readers, whether
theoretically, cognitively or practically inclined.

>From the foreword by Katharina Morik:

    "Machine   learning  -   as  artificial   intelligence
    in  general  -   grows  from  three  different  roots:
    cognition,  theory,  and  applications.    ...     The
    ideal  to  combine  the three  sources  of  artificial
    intelligence  research has almost never  been reached.
    ...    The  most important  capability for  artificial
    intelligence  is  to  keep the  integrative  view  and
    to  create  a  true  original work  that  goes  beyond
    the  collection  of   pieces  from  different  fields.
    In   presenting  the   long  way  from   psychological
    investigations  to  an   implemented  system  and  its
    theoretical  foundation,  this book  achieves such  an
    integrative  view of  concept formation and  knowledge
    revision."
