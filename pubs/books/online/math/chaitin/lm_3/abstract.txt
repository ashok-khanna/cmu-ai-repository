Abstract: This is yet another version of the course notes in
chao-dyn/9407003.  Here we change the universal Turing machine that is
used to measure program-size complexity so that the constants in our
information-theoretic incompleteness theorems are further reduced.
This is done by inventing a more complicated version of lisp in which
the parentheses associating defined functions with their arguments can
be omitted.  This is the third and last version of my course notes.
It is not clear to me which is to be preferred, so all three have been
made available for comment.
