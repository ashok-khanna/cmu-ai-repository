Abstract: This is an alternative version of the course notes in
chao-dyn/9407003.  The previous version is based on measuring the size
of lisp s-expressions.  This version is based on measuring the size of
what I call lisp m-expressions, which are lisp s-expressions with most
parentheses omitted.  This formulation of algorithmic information
theory is harder to understand than the one that was presented in
chao-dyn/9407003, but the constants obtained in all theorems are now
less than half the size that they were before.  It is not clear to me
which version of algorithmic information theory is to be preferred.
