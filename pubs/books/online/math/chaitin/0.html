<H2>Chaitin: The Limits of Mathematics</H2>

This book features a definitive reformulation of algorithmic
information theory with new more constructive definitions of
program-size complexity. It is a revised version of the course notes
given to the participant at the limits of mathematics short course,
University of Maine, Orono, Maine, June 1994.

The book discusses a new definition for a self-delimiting universal
Turing machine (UTM) that is easy to program and runs very quickly. It
then uses this to provide a new foundation for algorithmic information
theory (AIT), which is the theory of the size in bits of programs for
self-delimiting UTM's.  This new self-delimiting UTM is implemented
via an extremely fast LISP interpreter written in C. Source code for
the LISP interpreter is included in the book.

This directory includes a copy of a 4 page summary of the book and the
270-page book itself, in LaTeX, dvi, and PostScript formats.

Three different versions of the book (and source) are included, in the 
three directories lm_1, lm_2, and lm_3. The difference between the
three is as follows:

   An N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to exhibit any
   specific object with program-size complexity greater than N+c.

   An N-bit formal axiomatic system cannot enable one to determine more
   than N+c' scattered bits of the halting probability Omega.

   LM I:
  c = 2359 bits and c' = 7581 bits.
   LM II:
  c = 1127 bits and c' = 3689 bits.
   LM III:
  c =  994 bits and c' = 3192 bits.
   LM IV: 
         c =  735 bits and c' = 2933 bits.
