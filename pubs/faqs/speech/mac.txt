If you have access to a Macintosh, you might be interested in this...

Listing of Speech Manager/MacInTalk Pro/PlainTalk Aware Applications

Key Words: Speech Manager MacInTalk PlainTalk Gala Tea text to speech TTS
(Display in small monofont, e.g., 9pt Courier)


HOW DOES IT SOUND?
Relatively speaking, Apple's Speech Manager, with the high quality
voices, has a synthesized voice quality and pronunciation that are
among the best I've heard (Bellcore's Orator might do better with
proper nouns). Do you agree? Has anyone done formal testing of the
Speech Manager vs other TTS systems?

HAVE YOU SEEN?
Is there a Speech Manager aware application that allows graphical
specification of pitch and rate trajectories (similar to SoundEdit's
Bender, but on text or phoneme strings rather than on the waveform)?

TO GET IT
Part of the Speech Manager can be purchased with At Ease 2.x and
the CD-ROM version of System 7.5.  As of 9/1/94, CompuServe and
America Online don't have it.  Fortunately, Apple graciously provides
it via eWorld and the Internet.

The Speech Manager is available from Apple on the Internet
via anonymous ftp to ftp.apple.com in /dts/mac/sys.soft/speech.
There are 8 files in this directory and 2 installation options.
Among these files are Apple's SimpleText 1.1 application,
installation instructions, and Inside Macintosh style
documentation on the speech manager (in Apple DocViewer format):

   76652 Jul  3 03:33 simpletext.hqx
    2693 Jul  3 03:34 tts-read-me.txt
  370108 Aug 13  1993 speech-manager-docs.hqx

Select the installation option that's appropriate for your
hardware and desired performance:

Option #1 - MacinTalk 2
MacinTalk 2 produces moderate quality TTS and is suited for low-end
platforms where available memory is low and CPU bandwidth is limited.
Minimum configuration is System 6.7 running on a Mac Plus. To use
MacinTalk 2, download these files:

  334203 Jul  3 03:34 speech-manager.hqx
                      Speech Manager (1.2.1) system extension
                      includes Fred's voice

  127633 Jul  3 03:30 macintalk-2.hqx
                      MacinTalk 2 (1.2) speech synthesizer extension
                      includes Marvin's voice

  139960 Jul  3 03:33 macintalk2-voices.hqx
                      MacInTalk2 Voices (1.2) speech mgr document
                      9 more voices

Option #2 - MacinTalk Pro
MacinTalk Pro produces high quality TTS and is suited for platforms
with large memory and a 68020 or better processor running System 7
or greater. To use MacinTalk Pro, download these files:

  334203 Jul  3 03:34 speech-manager.hqx
                      Speech Manager (1.2.1) system extension
                      includes Fred's voice

  682166 Jul  3 03:32 macintalk-pro.hqx
                      MacinTalk Pro (1.2) speech synthesizer extension

12484674 Jul  3 03:58 voices.hqx
                      "High Quality" (large) and "Small" (lower
                      quality) versions of Agnes, Bruce, and Victoria.

TO INSTALL IT
To install either option, create a folder called Voices inside your
Extensions folder (System Folder for System 6 users) and place the
appropriate voice file(s) in it. Drag everything else onto your closed
System Folder and restart. To make your Mac talk, try SimpleText or
one of the applications below. 

Some of the following applications require Apple's stdTTS extension (a
standard dialog handler).  It's also on ftp.apple.com:

  /dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime/sample.code/speech-media-handler.hqx

The stdTTS extension is in one of the folders you get when you expand
the file "speech-media-handler.hqx".  Just install it in your extensions
folder and restart.

NOTES:
7/3/94
Apple's WWDC Technology P&A CD has MacinTalk Pro v. 1.2, Feb '94
and Speech Manager v. 1.2.1, Apr '94.  An installer is provided and
a "Voices" folder in your Extensions folder now holds the voice
files.  More MacinTalk Pro Voices are included with "High Quality"
and "Small" versions of Agnes, Bruce and Victoria (TTS Agnes, high
quality; TTS Agnes, small; TTS Bruce, high quality; TTS Bruce, small;
TTS Victoria, high quality; and TTS Victoria, small). "High Quality"
means that there's very little compression on the voice file resulting
in high audio fidelity but larger size.  "Small" means high compression
on the voice file resulting in small voice footprint but lower audio
fidelity.  Many new voices and special effects are also included
(Albert, Bad News, Bahh, Bells, Boing, Bubbles, Cellos, Deranged,
Good News, Hysterical, Junior, Kathy, Pipe Organ, Princess, Ralph,
Trinoids, Whisper, and Zarvox).

5/10/94
The Feb '94 Apple Developer CD has MacinTalkPro 2 v. 1.0, Sep '93.
