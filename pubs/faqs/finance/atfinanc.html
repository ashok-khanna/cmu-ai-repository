==================================================================
===
Q1.)  What is AT-Finance all about?

The Advanced Technology in Finance (AT-Finance) e-mail service is an initial  
service provided by the financial and economic applications special interest  
group of the international neural network society (INNS).  

This e-mail group is primarily intended to provide a forum for sharing  
information on advanced technology in financial and economic applications.

===
Q2.)  What constitutes an advanced technology (AT)?

The term advanced technology, as used here, refers to any technology or modern  
theory which has been applied to financial or economic data.   

Thus far, the technologies or theories which have been encompassed by the term  
are: Neural networks (NN), genetic algorithms (GA), fuzzy logic (FL),  
statistical (nonlinear, time-series, optimization, etc), complexity theory,  
artificial life (a-life), and nonlinear and chaos theory.  Some of these areas  
overlap or are very young so it is up to the discretion of the poster to  
classify any possible information.

===
Q3.)  How can I contact AT-Finance?   How can I contribute?

All AT-Finance documents include a signature like that below.  Three addresses  
are provided.  Mail addressed to:
at-finance-board@invnext.worldbank.org
  submits questions or comments to the at-finance mail list, and
at-finance-request@invnext.worldbank.org
  requests un/subscribe (within 24 hours), or submits information, and
at-finance@invnext.worldbank.org
  reports administrative/account problems

To contribute to this FAQ, send information or comments to  
at-finance-board@invnext.worldbank.org.  To contribute postscript or tex  
documents, mail to at-finance-board@invnext.worldbank.org OR to  
at-finance-request@invnext.worldbank.org.

===
Q4.)  Where can I find economic and financial data?

There are many commercial vendors of market and economic information.  Some  
provide time-series in real-time or in all-purpose formats but cost too much,  
while others are limited to particular retrieval programs or are of lower  
quality but cost in the order of <$100.  Some vendors are:

Q5.)  Where can I find basic information of econ/fin applications?

For financial applications:
Good books to begin with are the "WSJ guide to understanding Money and Markets"  
by Richard Wurman and A. Sigel (or any other basic Investments or Technical  
Analysis Text) for market dynamics.  For applications, the collection of  
reprints in Neural Networks in Finance and Investing edited by R. Trippi and E.  
Turban,  or Neural Network PC Tools (Chapter 12) by Eberhart and Dobbins, or  
Neural Networks in C++ (Chapter 4) by Adam Blum.

===
Q6.)  Which Conferences?

International Joint Conferences on Neural Networks (IJCNN) have had panel  
sessions on financial applications over the last two conferences as well as an  
increasing number of financial application papers in the application tracks.  
Contact:  IEEE or INNS conference services.
Proceedings:	Available through IEEE

IBC Technical Services has also sponsored confrences over the past three years  
entitled "Rocket Science Made Simple:......" or
	 "Expert Systems and Neural Networks in Trading"
Contact:  IBC at 011-44-71-637-4383
	  or IBC House, Canada Road, Byfleet, Surrey KT14 7JL, UK. or
	  IBC USA at 1-508-650-4700
	  or 8 Pleasant Street, Bldg D, South Natick, MA 01760, USA.
Proceedings:	Available through IBC.

IAKE co-sponsors International Conferences on Artificial Intelligence  
Applications on Wall Street every year.
Contact:  IAKE-International Association of Knowledge Engineers
	  at 1-301-948-5390

===
Q7.)  Which Journals and Magazines?

IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,  
Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities, Wall Street and Technology, RISK,  
Journal of Portfolio Management, and Financial Analyst Journal.

===
Q8.)  Which books are good for financial and economic AT practitioners?

          Predictions", Proc. Royal Soc., Series A, pp 103-
          125, (1986).

	  Investing", Probus, (1992).

===
Q9.)  Is there an electronic repository of AT-Finance related documents?

Not yet!  We are currently soliciting postscript or tex documents which should  
be compressed, uuencoded, and mailed to  
at-finance-request@invnext.worldbank.org.  These documents should have a strong  
relation to the application of AT to finance and economics!
