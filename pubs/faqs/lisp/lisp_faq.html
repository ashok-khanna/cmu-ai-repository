This is a reminder of the existence of the monthly FAQ postings to the
newsgroups comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.scheme, and comp.lang.clos. These
FAQ postings answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Lisp and
Lisp-like programming languages.

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Lisp and Scheme.  The FAQ
posting is an attempt to gather these questions and their answers into
a convenient reference for Lisp and Scheme programmers.  It is posted
once a month.  The hope is that this will cut down on the user time
and network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the same
questions over and over, as well as providing education by answering
questions some readers may not even have thought to ask.

***************************************************************************
***** SO, PLEASE, SEARCH THE FAQ POSTING FIRST IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION *****
*****                               AND                               *****
*****  DON'T POST ANSWERS TO FAQs: POINT THE ASKER TO THE FAQ POSTING *****
***************************************************************************

The FAQ postings are posted to the above-mentioned newsgroups on the
13th of every month. The posts are also sent to the newsgroup
news.answers where they should be available at any time (ask your local
news manager). This reminder is posted every Sunday.

  [2-7]   Can I call Lisp functions from other languages?
  [2-8]   I want to call a function in a package that might not exist at
          compile time. How do I do this?

  [2-21]  How do I tell if a symbol names a function and not a macro?

Common Pitfalls (Part 3):

  [3-0]  Why does (READ-FROM-STRING "foobar" :START 3) return FOOBAR
         instead of BAR?  
  [3-1]  Why can't it deduce from (READ-FROM-STRING "foobar" :START 3)
         that the intent is to specify the START keyword parameter
         rather than the EOF-ERROR-P and EOF-VALUE optional parameters?   
  [3-2]  Why can't I apply #'AND and #'OR?
  [3-3]  I used a destructive function (e.g. DELETE, SORT), but it
         didn't seem to work.  Why? 
  [3-4]  After I NREVERSE a list, it's only one element long.  After I
         SORT a list, it's missing things.  What happened? 
  [3-5]  Why does (READ-LINE) return "" immediately instead of waiting
         for me to type a line?  
  [3-6]  I typed a form to the read-eval-print loop, but nothing happened. Why?
  [3-7]  DEFMACRO doesn't seem to work.
         When I compile my file, LISP warns me that my macros are undefined
         functions, or complains "Attempt to call <function> which is 
         defined as a macro.
  [3-8]  Name conflict errors are driving me crazy! (EXPORT, packages)
  [3-9]  Closures don't seem to work properly when referring to the
         iteration variable in DOLIST, DOTIMES, DO and LOOP.
  [3-10] What is the difference between FUNCALL and APPLY?
  [3-11] Miscellaneous things to consider when debugging code.
  [3-12] When is it right to use EVAL?
  [3-13] Why does my program's behavior change each time I use it?
  [3-14] When producing formatted output in Lisp, where should you put the
         newlines (e.g., before or after the line, FRESH-LINE vs TERPRI,
         ~& vs ~% in FORMAT)?
  [3-15] I'm using DO to do some iteration, but it doesn't terminate.

  [5-3]   How can I list all the CLOS instances in a class?
  [5-4]   How can I store data and CLOS instances (with possibly circular

If you think of questions that are appropriate for these FAQs, or would
like to improve an answer, please send email to us at ai+lisp-faq@cs.cmu.edu.

Note that the lisp-faq mailing list is for discussion of the content
of the FAQ postings only.  It is not the place to ask questions about
Lisp; use either the common-lisp@ai.sri.com mailing list or the
comp.lang.lisp newsgroup for that.  Likewise, it is not the place to
ask questions about Scheme; use either the scheme@ai.mit.edu mailing
list or the comp.lang.scheme newsgroup (scheme@mc.lcs.mit.edu) for
that.  If a question appears frequently in one of those forums, it
will get added to the appropriate FAQ list.
