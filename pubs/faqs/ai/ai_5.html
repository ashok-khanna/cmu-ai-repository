Subject: [5-0] General Information about FTP Resources for AI

Remember, when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .gz, .arc, .fit,
etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .gz suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from
   prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

If you do not have ftp access, you can FTP files by E-mail. Send a
message with the word "help" in the body to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. As
the DECWRL ftpmail server is overloaded, you are encouraged to use an
alternate ftpmail server, such as ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au (Australia),
ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de (Germany), ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk (Great
Britain), ftpmail@ieunet.ie (Ireland), ftpmail@lth.se (Sweden),
ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu (USA), ftpmail@ftp.uu.net (USA, message
relayed to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com, so don't use it),
ftpmail@gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu (USA), or
ftpmail@seds.lpl.arizona.edu (USA). If you're on BITNET, send a
message with the word "help" in the body to BITFTP@PUCC, BITFTP@PLEARN
or BITFTP@DEARN (Internet equivalents bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu,
bitftp@plearn.edu.pl and bitftp@vm.gmd.de, respectively).

In general, see the Lisp FAQ for Lisp-related software and the Prolog
Resource Guide and the Prolog FAQ for Prolog-related software. If a
Lisp-based or Prolog-based system is listed here, only the ftp site
and directory will be listed; for a more detailed description, see the
Lisp FAQ and the Prolog Resource Guide. For information on obtaining
the Lisp FAQ or the Prolog Resource Guide see [1-0].

When referring to software, "alpha" indicates an internal early
release, "beta" indicates an external early release, and "omega"
indicates an external "finished" release. Generally an "alpha" release
means the creator hasn't yet tested for bugs.

Subject: [5-1] FTP Repositories

CMU AI Repository:

   The CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by
   Carnegie Mellon University to contain public domain and freely
   distributable software, publications, and other materials of
   interest to AI researchers, educators, students, and practitioners. 
   The AI Repository currently contains more than a gigabyte of
   material and is growing steadily. 

   The AI Repository is accessible for free by anonymous FTP, AFS, and
   WWW. A selection of materials from the AI Repository is also being
   published on CD-ROM by Prime Time Freeware and is available for
   purchase by mail or fax (see [6-5] for more information).

   The AI Repository is accessible by anonymous FTP from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/            [128.2.206.173]
   by AFS (Andrew File System) from
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/
   and by WWW from the URL   
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html
   Be sure to read the files 0.doc and readme.txt in this directory.

   The AI Repository is still under construction, but to date, the
   AI Programming Languages and the AI Software Packages sections
   are "complete". These can be accessed in the lang/ and areas/
   subdirectories of the AI Repository. Compression and archiving
   utilities may be found in the util/ subdirectory.  Other directories,
   which are in varying states of completion, are events/ (Calendar of
   Events, Conference Calls) and pubs/ (Publications, including technical
   reports, books, mail/news archives).

   The AI Programming Languages section of the repository includes
   directories for Common Lisp, Prolog, Scheme, Smalltalk, and
   other AI-related programming languages. 

   The AI Software Packages section of the repository includes
   subdirectories for:

      agents/      Intelligent Agent Architectures 
      alife/       Artificial Life and Complex Adaptive Systems

   The repository has standardized on using 'tar' for producing
   archives of files and 'gzip' for compression.

   To search the keyword index by mail, send a message to:
      ai+query@cs.cmu.edu
   with one or more lines containing calls to the keys command, such as:
      keys lisp iteration
   in the message body.  Keywords may be regular expressions and are
   compared with the index in a case-insensitive conjunctive fashion.  
   You'll get a response by return mail. Do not include anything else in 
   the Subject line of the message or in the message body.  For help on
   the query mail server, include: 
      help
   instead. 

   A Mosaic interface to the keyword searching program is accessible
   through the URL
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/keys/keysform.html

   We plan on making the source code (including indexes) to
   this keyword searching program available, as soon as it is stable.

   We hope to eventually have a fully automated calendar of events,
   an expanded AI Publications directory, mailing list and newsgroup
   archives, and much much more. 

   Contributions of software and other materials are always welcome but
   must be accompanied by an unambiguous copyright statement that grants
   permission for free use, copying, and distribution -- either a
   declaration by the author that the materials are in the public domain,
   that the materials are subject to the GNU General Public License (cite
   version), or that the materials are subject to copyright, but the
   copyright holder grants permission for free use, copying, and
   distribution. (We will tell you if the copying permissions are too
   restrictive for us to include the materials in the repository.)
   Inclusion of materials in the repository does not modify their
   copyright status in any way. Materials may be placed in:
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/new/
   When you put anything in this directory, please send mail to
      ai+contrib@cs.cmu.edu
   giving us permission to distribute the files, and state whether
   this permission is just for the AI Repository, or also includes
   publication on the CD-ROM version (Prime Time Freeware for AI).
   We would also appreciate if you would include a 0.doc file for your
   package; see /user/ai/new/package.doc for a template. (If you don't
   have the time to write your own, we can write it for you based on
   the information in your package.)

   For more information on the CMU AI Repository, please send mail to
   Mark Kantrowitz <AI.Repository@cs.cmu.edu>.

Ada Repository:

   The Ada Repository on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (mailing list
   ada-sw@wsmr-simtel20.army.mil) contains a directory of AI programs in
   PD2:<ADA.AI>*.*. A somewhat easier to access copy of the archives is
   available as wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/ada/ai/.

UCLA Artificial Life Depository:

   ftp.cognet.ucla.edu:/pub/alife/ [128.97.8.19]

   Repository of papers, articles, tech reports, software and other items of
   interest to Artificial Life researchers. It includes an archive of
   past postings to the alife mailing list, alife@cognet.ucla.edu (send
   mail to alife-request@cognet.ucla.edu to be added to the list).

Artificial Life Online and the Artificial Life BBS:

   Sponsored by MIT Press and the Santa Fe Institute, Artificial Life
   Online and the Artificial Life BBS is intended to be a central
   information collection and distribution site on the Internet for any
   and all aspects of the Artificial Life endeavor.

   A special feature of the BBS is a collection of 40 or so local
   newsgroups dedicated to a wide variety of topics in Artificial Life.

   Artificial Life Online is accessible by anonymous ftp from
      alife.santafe.edu:/pub/ [192.12.12.99]
   by World-Wide Web from
      http://alife.santafe.edu/
   and by Gopher from
      gopher://alife.santafe.edu:70/

   To access the Alife Online BBS (ALBBS) by telnet, telnet to
   alife.santafe.edu and login as "bbs". You will find yourself in a
   specially constructed UNIX shell within which either BBS menu commands
   or UNIX commands can be used to browse around in the system. Run the
   "account" program to set up a local account. These accounts will
   initially be provided free of charge, but they will eventually have to
   charge a nominal fee in order to cover operating expenses (on the
   order of $15-$25 per year). Subscribers to the Artificial Life Journal
   from MIT Press will have this fee waived. Once you have an account on
   alife.santafe.edu, you can telnet to alife.santafe.edu and login as
   yourself. You do not have to create an account to use the ALBBS via
   telnet -- you can simply login as "bbs" and browse through the system
   using the BBS commands.

   Please send suggestions and questions about the Alife Online/BBS
   system to feedback@alife.santafe.edu.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented in Prolog:

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms. The library
   includes - amongst others - PROLOG implementations of Winston's arch, 
   Becker's AQ-PROLOG, Fisher's COBWEB, Brazdil's generation of 
   discriminations from derivation trees, Quinlan's ID3, FOIL, IDT,
   substitution matching, explanation based generalization, inverse 
   resolution, and Mitchell's version spaces algorithm. 
   All algorithms are written in Edinburgh Prolog syntax. Most of the
   algorithms are copyleft under the GNU General Public License. 
   The programs are currently available via anonymous ftp-server from
   the GMD: 

        ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/ML-Program-Library/ [129.26.8.84]

   They are also available by surface mail from Thomas Hoppe, 
   Projektgruppe KIT, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Franklinstr. 28/29,
   10629 Berlin, Germany. Files will be distributed via MS-DOS formated
   3.5 inch floppy (double, high and extra-high density),  which should
   be included with your request. You can also get them by sending an email
   message to Thomas Hoppe (see below).

   Send additional PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning
   Algorithms, complaints about them and detected bugs or problems
   to Thomas Hoppe, <hoppet@cs.tu-berlin.de>. Send suggestions and
   complaints about the ftp library to Werner Emde, Gesellschaft
   fuer Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung, Bonn, <emde@gmd.de>. 

   The directory ftp.gmd.de:/MachineLearning/ contains additional
   machine learning publications, data, and software, primarily related
   to the European ESPRIT projects Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT) and
   Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the European Network of Excellence
   in Machine Learning (MLnet) and the Inductive Logic Programming
   Pan-European Scientific Network (ILPnet). It includes the source code
   of Stephen Muggleton's and Cao Feng's GOLEM learning system (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/software/golem) and a BibTex file with
   around 325 entries of articles related to ILP (in
   /MachineLearning/ILP/public/bib). For more information, send mail to
   Marcus Luebbe <ml-archive@gmd.de>.

   The collection includes Lisp and C implementations of Scott
   Fahlman's Cascade Correlation algorithm, Scott Fahlman's
   Quickprop variation on the back-propagation algorithm, and Scott
   Fahlman's Recurrent Cascade-Correlation simulator. The collection also
   includes Aspririn/Migraines and Tesauro. The neural network benchmark
   collection is available in 
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/connect/bench/
   The data sets include the NETtalk data, a vowel recognition
   task, and several others.
   The archives of the connectionists mailing list are kept in
      /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/connect/connect-archives/
   along with a Lisp implementation of a backprop simulator. For more
   information, write to neural-bench@cs.cmu.edu.

Subject: [5-2a] FTP and Other Resources: Agents -- Planning

In addition to programs available free by anonymous ftp, we've
included some programs which are available by contacting the authors,
and some programs which charge a nominal fee.

Agent Modelling:

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell,
   <toby@castle.ed.ac.uk>, for his PhD thesis.  The thesis examines the
   problem of action selection when dealing with realistic, animal-like
   situations: how to choose, at each moment in time, the most
   appropriate out of a repertoire of possible actions.  It includes a
   description is given of a simulated environment which is an extensive
   and detailed simulation of the problem of action selection for
   animals.  This simulated environment is used to investigate the
   adequacy of several theories of action selection (from both ethology
   and artificial intelligence) such as the drive model, Lorenz's
   psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading activation network, and
   outlines deficiencies in each mechanism. Finally, it proposes a new
   approach to action selection is developed which determines the most
   appropriate action in a principled way, and which does not suffer from
   the inherent shortcomings found in other methods. The thesis includes
   a review and bibliography of existing work on action selection. The
   thesis is available by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.ed.ac.uk:/pub/lrtt/ [129.215.146.5]
   as the files as.1.ps.Z, as.2.ps.Z, ..., and as.7.ps.Z.
   The simulation software is also available from the same site, as the
   file se.tar.Z. The simulation software was written in Suntools rather
   than Xtools.  It can be run only from SunView or OpenWindows.  The
   action selection problem modelled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing, not
   getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc), many internal and
   external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see the
   bibliography section on User Modelling).  This can be seen as a form of
   agent modelling tool, which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep
   nested belief spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs 
   that are typically held by groups of agents.  ViewGen is available by
   anonymous ftp from 
      crl.nmsu.edu:/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder [128.123.1.18] (user anonymous)
      ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/ballim    [141.58.127.8] (user ftp)
   as the file ViewGen.tar.Z. The theory of belief ascription upon which
   it is based is described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation which is
   archived with the Viewgen program (in the files 
      ViewFinder-{A4/A5/US}.tar.Z, 
   the variable part indicating the format of the PostScript file).
   The inheritance reasoner is in the file vf-hetis.tar.Z.
   Implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence easily convertible to
   any Edinburgh-style prolog. Contact Afzal Ballim <afzal@divsun.unige.ch>

Artificial Life:

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.
   Tierra runs in Unix and MS-DOS. Source code and documentation is
   available by anonymous ftp at 
      tierra.slhs.udel.edu:/almond/ [128.175.41.34]

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 
      ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z
   Contact Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@ai.mit.edu> for further information.

   The Screamer Tool Repository, a collection of user-contributed
   Screamer code, is available by anonymous ftp from

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/
   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt <ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk> and Jens
   Doerpmund <dorpmunj@cs.man.ac.uk> and runs in Common Lisp.

   GPQUICK is a simple GP system implemented in C++.  It features an
   elegant object architecture with function (Function), program
   (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  The Problem class
   is proposed as a portable representation for problems that would be
   source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.  GPQUICK uses a
   steady state GA, tournament selection, one type of mutation, and
   subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear representation for
   S-expressions. It includes documentation from the associated magazine
   article (Byte, "Some Assembly Required", February 1994). GPQUICK is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cc.utexas.edu:/pub/genetic-programming/code/
   as the files gpquick.tar (unix version, tested with CC and g++) and
   gpquick.zip (PC/ANSI C version, tested with Borland 3.1).

   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600
   and higher, VAX Common Lisp, and MCL. The XGinseng interface is built
   on top of Garnet.  SNePS 2.1 is free according to the GNU General
   Public License version 2. The SNePS distribution is available by

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
   free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/
   The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a
   graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   PEBLS (Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System) is a nearest-neighbor
   learning system designed for applications where the instances have

   OC1 (Oblique Classifier 1) is a multivariate decision tree induction
   system designed for applications where the instances have numeric
   feature values.  OC1 builds decision trees that contain linear
   combinations of one or more attributes at each internal node; these
   trees then partition the space of examples with both oblique and
   axis-parallel hyperplanes.  OC1 has been used for classification of
   data from several real world domains, such as astronomy and cancer
   diagnosis.  A technical decription of the algorithm can be found in
   the AAAI-93 paper by Sreerama K. Murthy, Simon Kasif, Steven Salzberg
   and Richard Beigel.  A postscript version of this paper is included in
   the distribution. OC1 is a written entirely in ANSI C. OC1 is

   Set-Enumeration (SE) Trees for Induction/Classification. Significant
   research in Machine Learning, and in Statistics, has been devoted to
   the induction and use of decision trees as classifiers.  An induction
   framework which generalizes decision trees using a Set-Enumeration
   (SE) tree is outlined in  
      Rymon, R. (1993), An SE-tree-based Characterization of the Induction
      Problem. In Proc. of the Tenth International Conference on Machine
      Learning, Amherst MA, pp. 268-275.
   In this framework, called SE-Learn, rather than splitting according to
   a single attribute, one recursively branches on all (or most) relevant
   attributes. An induced SE-tree can be shown to economically embed many
   decision trees, thereby supporting a more expressive hypothesis
   representation. Also, by branching on many attributes, SE-Learn
   removes much of the algorithm-dependent search bias. Implementations
   of SE-Learn can benefit from many techniques developed for decision
   trees (e.g., attribute-selection and pruning measures). In particular,
   SE-Learn can be tailored to start off with one's favorite decision
   tree, and then improve upon it by further exploring the SE-tree. This
   hill-climbing algorithm allows trading time/space for added accuracy.
   Current studies (yet unpublished) show that SE-trees are particularly
   advantageous in domains where (relatively) few examples are available
   for training, and in noisy domains. Finally, SE-trees can provide a
   unified framework for combining induced knowledge with knowledge
   available from other sources (Rymon, 1994).

   generators for natural languages.  The package comes with a number of
   example grammars, including a Categorial Grammar, a Tree Adjoining
   Grammar, a Unification Grammar in the spirit of Head-driven Phrase
   Structure Grammar, an Extraposition Grammar, a Definite Clause
   Grammar, and a port of the HPSG grammar from Bob Carpenter's ALE
   system. Each of the grammars comes with a set of parsers, such as 
   Earley-like chart parsers, left-corner parsers and head-driven
   parsers. Some grammars come with variants of the head-driven
   generator. The package allows easy comparison of different
   parsers/generators, extensive possibilities of compiling feature
   equations into Prolog terms, graphical (Tk), LaTeX and ordinary Prolog
   output of trees, feature structures and Prolog terms, and plotted
   graphs and tables of statistical information. Hdrug runs in Sicstus
   Prolog and requires ProTcl and Tcl/Tk. It is available by anonymous
   FTP from
      tyr.let.rug.nl:/pub/prolog-app/Hdrug/
   or by WWW from
      http://tyr.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/prolog-app/Hdrug/

   MUME (Multi-Module Neural Computing Environment) is a simulation
   environment for multi-modules neural computing. It provides an object
   oriented facility for the simulation and training of multiple nets
   with various architectures and learning algorithms.  The object
   oriented structure makes simple the addition of new network classes
   and new learning algorithms. MUME includes a library of network
   architectures including feedforward, simple recurrent, and
   continuously running recurrent neural networks.  Each architecture is
   supported by a variety of learning algorithms, including backprop,
   weight perturbation, node perturbation, and simulated annealing.  MUME
   can be used for large scale neural network simulations as it provides
   support for learning in multi-net environments. It also provide pre-
   and post-processing facilities.  MUME can be used to include
   non-neural computing modules (decision trees, etc.) in applications. _
   MUME is being developed at the Machine Intelligence Group at Sydney
   University Electrical Engineering. The software is written in 'C' and
   is being used on Sun and DEC workstations. Efforts are underway to
   port it to the Fujitsu VP2200 vector processor using the VCC
   vectorising C compiler, HP 9000/700, SGI workstations, DEC
   Alphas, and PC DOS (with DJGCC). MUME is available to research
   institutions on a media/doc/postage cost arrangement after
   signing a license agreement. The license agreement is available by
   anonymous ftp from mickey.sedal.su.oz.au:/pub/license.ps [129.78.24.170].

   ToolDiag
   ToolDiag is a feature selection program that increases the accuracy of
   classifiers and reduces their complexity by providing them with a
   subset containing only the most relevant features. It has interfaces
   to LVQ_PAK and SNNS, and uses a data file format that is compatible
   with that of LVQ_PAK. The 2-d graphics can be displayed using the
   GNUPLOT plotting package. ToolDiag implements many concepts from
   Devijver and Kittler's book "Pattern Recognition -- A Statistical
   Approach" (Prentice Hall, 1982), including the optimal branch and
   bound search strategy, together with several different selection
   criteria. ToolDiag can also perform an error estimation using the
   leave-one-out method and a K-nearest-neighbor classifier. It also
   includes a learning module (Q*) that has the same functionality as
   LVQ. ToolDiag cannot handle missing values and requires continuous or
   ordered discrete numerical features. ToolDiag is implemented in C and
   documentation and source code are available by anonymous ftp from

   The HYPERPLANE ANIMATOR is a program that allows convenient graphical
   display of the training data and weights in a back-propagation neural
   network.  As learning progresses and the weights in a neural net
   alter, the hyperplane positions move.  At the end of the training they
   are in positions that roughly divide training data into partitions,
   each of which contains only one class of data.  Observations of
   hyperplane movement can yield valuable insights into neural network
   learning.  The Animator, developed by Lori Pratt and Steve Nicodemus
   of the Colorado School of Mines, uses the Motif toolkit on an IBM
   RS6000 with X-Windows.  The system currently animates only hyperplanes
   representing input-to-hidden weights.  The animator is available by
   anonymous ftp from
      mines.colorado.edu:/pub/software/hyperplane-animator/ [138.67.1.3]
   as the file hyperplane-animator.tar. An openwindows version of the
   animator is available by anonymous ftp from
       cs.rutgers.edu:/pub/hyperplane.animator
   For more information, write to lpratt@mines.colorado.edu.

   SUZY is a simple neural net classifier system for PCs written in C++
   and Turbo Vision. RBFs are used to implement the classifier system
   with a class-based algorithm being applied to find the centres and
   radii of the RBS units. The program is not intended for any serious
   applications and is quite slow, but may be of interest to some people.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from
      rhino.cis.vutbr.cz:/pub/software/ai/suzy.tar.Z [147.229.3.10]
   For further information, contact tgrove@psycho.fme.vutbr.cz.

   MBP (Matrix Back Propagation) is an efficient implementation of the
   back-propagation algorithm for current-generation workstations.  The
   algorithm includes a per-epoch adaptive technique for gradient
   descent.  All the computations are done through matrix multiplications
   and make use of highly optimized C code. The goal is to reach almost
   peak-performances on RISCs with superscalar capabilities and fast
   caches.  On some machines (and with large networks) a 30-40x speed-up
   can be measured respect to conventional implementations.  
   The software is available by anonymous ftp from
      risc6000.dibe.unige.it:/pub/ [130.251.89.154]
   as MBPv1.1.tar.Z (unix version) and MBPv11.zip (DOS version).  The

Neural Systems (Biological Simulation):

   BIOSIM is a biologically-oriented neural network simulator.  It
   implements four neuron models: a simple model only switching ion
   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  It is in the public domain and runs on Unix workstations
   (a less-powerful PC version is also available). BIOSIM includes a
   graphical user interface and was designed for research and teaching.
   It is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.uni-kl.de:/pub/bio/neurobio [131.246.9.95]
   For more information, write to Stefan Bergdoll <bergdoll@zxa.basf-ag.de>.

   GENESIS (GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
   simulation platform which supports the simulation of neural systems
   ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large
   networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.  Most current
   GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological
   neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract
   networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and
   similar connectionist modeling.  GENESIS and its graphical front-end
   XODUS are written in C and run on SUN and DEC graphics work stations
   under UNIX (Sun version 4.0 and up, Ultrix 3.1, 4.0 and up), and
   X-windows (versions X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5).  The current version of
   GENESIS has also been used with Silicon Graphics (Irix 4.0.1 and up)
   and the HP 700 series (HPUX).  The distribution includes full source
   code and documentation for both GENESIS and XODUS as well as fourteen
   demonstration and tutorial simulations.  Documentation for these
   simulations is included, along with three papers that describe the
   general organization of the simulator.  GENESIS is available by
   anonymous ftp from genesis.cns.caltech.edu (131.215.137.64). Before
   using ftp, you must telnet to genesis.cns.caltech.edu and login as the
   user "genesis" (no password required) to register.  If you answer all
   the questions asked of you an 'ftp' account will automatically be
   created for you.  You can then 'ftp' back to the machine and download
   the software.  Further inquiries concerning GENESIS may be addressed
   to genesis@cns.caltech.edu.
