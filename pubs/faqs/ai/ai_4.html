This part of the AI FAQ provides a bibliography of good introductory
texts and overviews of AI and specific subfields of AI. If you feel
that there is a reference or set of references which should be added
to this FAQ, or references which should be removed, please send email
to mkant+ai-faq@cs.cmu.edu.  When suggesting references to be
included in a particular subfield, only suggest the best two or three
references (or a particularly well-written overview). It is NOT the
intention of this listing to be a comprehensive AI bibliography.

Books suggested by their authors must present a strongly argued case.
Also, I generally will include books in this list only after I have
had a chance to look at them.  If you are the author or publisher of a
new AI-related text, and you want me to consider your book for this
list, send a complimentary copy to Mark Kantrowitz, School of Computer
Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh,
PA 15213-3891 USA. Please don't waste my time with books that are
clearly not appropriate for this list. When I am done with the book I
will donate it to the CMU Engineering & Science Library.

Subject: [0] AI book publication announcements mailing list

The AI BOOK ANNOUNCEMENTS mailing list exists to inform the AI
community about the publication of new AI-related books. 

Material appropriate for the list includes announcements of BOOKS
about Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, Lisp, Prolog, and
related topics and should be sent to ai+book-announce@cs.cmu.edu.

Please include a line of the form
   Slug: AuthorSlug
in the publication announcement, where "AuthorSlug" should be replaced
with a filename for the announcement. The format for file names is the
author's last name followed by the year. For example, a book by James
Allen published in 1995 would be given the slug allen95. This slug
will be used for archiving the publication announcement. Please also
use the following standard for subject lines; this example is again
based on James Allen's book. 
   Subject: Book: James Allen, Natural Language Understanding, 2e 

To subscribe, send a message to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   subscribe book-announce <First Name> <Last Name>, <Affiliation/Organization>
in the message body and no Subject line. 

For help on using the query server, send mail to ai+query@cs.cmu.edu with
   help
in the message body.

All publication announcements are archived in the directory
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/books/announce/

If you have any other questions, please send them to ai+@cs.cmu.edu

Subject: [1]  AI in general (Introductions, Overviews)

The lack of a review or the presence of a short review should not be
interpreted as indicating anything about the quality of the text.

Introductory texts:

   Elaine Rich & Kevin Knight, "Artificial Intelligence", 2nd edition,
   McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991. ISBN 0-07-052263-4. [One of the more
   popular introductory texts to AI, giving a very good general
   overview of most AI topics. In some places the book sacrifices
   depth for breadth, and a few more recent topics are neglected.
   Nevertheless this book provides an excellent foundation in areas
   central to AI. Source code is available from
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/bookcode/knight/.] 

   Patrick Henry Winston, "Artificial Intelligence", Third Edition, 
   Addison Wesley, Reading, MA, 1992, ISBN 0-201-53377-4.
   [A classic early AI text. This text is very much hands-on, with
   actual toy examples. Source code is in ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/ai3/.]

   Matthew L. Ginsberg, "Essentials of AI", Morgan Kaufmann
   Publishers, 1993, ISBN 1-55860-221-6, 430 pages, $49.95. 
      [Topics include search, knowledge representation, logic,
      assumption-based truth maintenance, nonmonotonic reasoning,
      probability, frames, semantic nets, planning, learning, vision,
      natural language processing, and expert systems.]

   George Luger and William Stubblefield, "Artificial Intelligence:
   Structures and Strategies for Complex Problem Solving", 2nd
   Edition, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1993.
   720 pages, ISBN 0-8053-4780-1.
   [Includes algorithms implemented in Lisp and Prolog.]

   Ian Pratt, "Artificial Intelligence", Macmillan, London, 1994. 280
   pages, ISBN 0-333-59755-9 ($35). [In-depth introduction to several
   AI topics, using inference as a central theme. As a result, omits
   topics like NLP, expert systems, vision, and robotics. Hence this
   book is a good themed introduction to a subset of AI, but is not
   suitable for a general purpose overview of AI. Curiously, the book
   does include a chapter on neural networks which doesn't fit into
   the theme, in addition to chapters on planning, search, and other
   topics related to logic and reasoning. 
   The presentation is superb, doing an excellent job of conveying the
   essential insights behind the concepts, followed by the technical
   details and pseudocode for the algorithms. Very good use of diagrams
   to explain difficult concepts. Heavily dependent on predicate
   calculus, with a tutorial introduction in the appendix. Suitable
   for an advanced undergraduate/introductory masters-level course. A
   longer version of this review is available as 
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/pubs/books/reviews/pratt.txt]

   Thomas L. Dean, James Allen, John Aloimonons, "Artificial
   Intelligence: Theory and Practice", Benjamin/Cummings, 1994. 680

   by anonymous ftp from bc.aw.com:/bc/dean/, along with selected
   illustrations from the text.]

   Approach", Prentice Hall, 1994. 840 pages, $57.95.

Subject: [1b] How do I get a copy of the proceedings to conference <x>?

First, ask your librarian for help. If your local library doesn't have it,
they may be able to get it on interlibrary loan.

If you want to buy your own copy, first check with the organization
that ran the conference. See part 3 of the AI FAQ for a list of many
of the AI organizations that sponsor conferences.

If they can't help you, contact the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), and look up the proceedings in their Index to Scientific and
Technical Proceedings (ISTP volumes). You can contact the ISI at

   Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.
   3501 Market Street
   Philadelphia, PA 19104
   Phone: 215-386-0100
   Fax: 215-386-6362

Another source for proceedings author and subject indexes is:

   Directory of Published Proceedings. 
   Series SEMT: Science/Engineering/Medicine/Technology.
   Published monthly with annual cumulations by InterDok, Harrison, NY. 
   ISSN 0012-3293.

Subject: [1c] How do I get a copy of <x>'s PhD dissertation?

Most dissertations from US universities are available from 

University Microfilms International, Inc.
300 North Zeeb Road
Ann Arbor, MI 48106
Phone: 800-521-0600 (313-761-4700)
       800-343-5299 (in Canada)

They will print a copy of the dissertation from microfilm and bind it
in paperbound or cloth for a reasonable fee.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1d] Tech Reports, Abstracts, etc.

The easiest and cheapest way to get a copy of a tech report, paper, or
thesis is to send email to the author. Most researchers will be happy
to drop a copy of the report to you in the mail, or give you a pointer
to an online copy. In some cases they may direct you to a central
technical report coordinator for their department (see [6-2]), and
getting a copy may involve a nominal fee.

Videotapes:

   The 4th episode of the PBS series "The Machine That Changed the World" is
   a good introduction to AI. It is available for $90 from Films for the
   Humanities, 1-800-257-5126.

   Morgan Kaufmann also has a good set of tapes of AI-related lectures, but
   it runs on the expensive side.

   University Video Communications sells a few AI-related videotapes,
   including Allen Newell's "Desires & Diversions". For more
   information, write to UVC, PO Box 5129, Stanford, CA 94309, call

   Both magazines are excellent sources of commercial product reviews
   and frequently publish "Product Guides/Showcases" that list many of the
   commercial products available in a particular area of AI, such as
   expert systems, neural nets, natural language processing, and so on.
