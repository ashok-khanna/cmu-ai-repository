Issue:          2.1

Hello, and welcome to the new, reformatted, comp.ai.genetic FAQ, 
"The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation".

I have taken over from Joerg Heitkoetter as the editor of the FAQ, and
its been my task in the past months to take care of it.  At last,
version 2.1 is ready to be revealed to the world :-)

The main differences between 2.1 and the previous version are mainly in
its format, rather than its content. These are described below. The next
edition is due out on June 20th. From time to time, I'll post reminders
to tell people how to pick up copies by FTP.

As always, if you have information which could usefully go into the
guide, send it to me. If you find any information is inaccurate, please
let me know (if possible, with the _accurate_ information). All
contributions/help welcome.

If you have any questions which you'd like to be answered in the FAQ, post
them to the newsgroup first. If any sensible answers are forthcoming, I'll
include the information in the FAQ.

SAFIER and ENCORE

At about the time the last edition of the FAQ was released, a new FTP
repository for evolutionary computing had just come on stream: SAFIER.
Alas, as some of you will have discovered, SAFIER is no longer
operating.  The good news is that it is to be replaced by not one, but
a _network_ of servers! These will go under the name ENCORE - "The
EvolutioNary COmputation Repository Network".

The new release of the FAQ carries information about the two ENCORE
nodes for which there are firm plans. But please note that at time of
posting, these servers have yet to be "officially" announced.

Please wait until you see an official announcement on this newsgroup
before attempting to access these sites, to avoid creating
administrative headaches.

CHANGES

Format changes - 

    Now comes in 6 parts, with the following broad categories:

	1. Intro to the FAQ and the newsgroup		22k
	2. Descriptions of different types of EAs	50k
	3. Practice and theory				40k
	4. References and information sources		54k
	5. EA software packages				61k
	6. Other topics and glossary			58k

    Text version is more conformant with rfc1153, making it easier to
    search for specific questions, using some newsreaders. (Postscript
    version retains similar formatting to earlier versions.) 

    Local table of contents provided in each part.

    More consistent references to ftp sites.

    More cross-references between questions.

Content changes -

    Some overlong entries have been trimmed (and more will probably be
    trimmed in the next release).

    References to SAFIER changed to the new ENCORE service.

    Question titles revised to give clearer indication of content, (and
    improved grammar).

    Q2 - Information on GAs and Game Playing added

    Q10.8 - Many more bibliographies included

    Q15.2 - GEARS added

    Q20/Q20.1 - Entries for GA Workbench and DGENESIS updated
              - Entry for GANNET added

    Q22 - New question on Test Data sources added

    Q99 - Many new glossary entries added.



And finally...

Thanks to Joerg for putting in all the hard work involved in compiling
the FAQ in the first place. My task, from now on, is a comparatively
simple one...
