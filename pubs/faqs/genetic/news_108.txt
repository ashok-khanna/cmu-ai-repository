Dear folks,

the FAQ now comes with this little appendix, listing all the changes
made to the previous month's posting.

The PostScript version on "lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de" is
available as "/pub/EA/docs/hhgtec-1.08.ps.gz", ie. it has been
compressed using gzip(1), the GNU compression utility, which allows for
(a) better compression than compress/.Z, as used before, and (b)
uses an unpatentable algorithm, as opposed to compress. Gzip is
available for all currently available platforms (even for VMS) via
the GNU server prep.ai.mit.edu; oder from it's mirror sites, that
are listed below.

  * Do we need mutation AND crossover?
	(cf Spears in FOGA2, 221-237)
	[..]

SPECIAL THANKS
  To Mark Davis, for a just-in-time production of an EP draft.
  Dan Abell for the Gray Coding contribution.
  Last not least, David Beasley for his extraordinary workload with
  the glossary! And again, some new Glossary items, heated discussions,
  on the design of "string processing tools," the GNU project, and
  everything...

  This is to YOU, (and to all those opposed ;-)

Enjoy!
