Subject: Q2: What applications of EAs are there?

     In   principle,   EAs  can  compute  any  computable  function,  i.e.
     everything a normal digital computer can do.

     But EAs are especially badly suited for problems where efficient ways
     of  solving  them  are  already  known,  (unless  these  problems are
     intended to serve as benchmarks).  Special purpose  algorithms,  i.e.
     algorithms  that  have  a  certain amount of problem domain knowledge
     hard coded into them, will usually outperform EAs,  so  there  is  no
     black  magic  in EC.  EAs should be used when there is no other known
     problem solving strategy, and  the  problem  domain  is  NP-complete.
     That's  where  EAs  come  into  play: heuristically finding solutions
     where all else fails.

     Following  is  an  incomplete   (sic!)    list   of   successful   EA
     applications:

 TIMETABLING
     This  has  been addressed quite successfully with GAs.  A very common
     manifestation of this kind of problem is the timetabling of exams  or
     classes  in  Universities,  etc.  At  the  Department  of  Artificial
     Intelligence, University of Edinburgh, timetabling the MSc  exams  is
     now done using a GA (Corne et al. 93, Fang 92). An example of the use
     of GAs for timetabling classes is (Abramson & Abela 1991).

     In the exam timetabling case,  the  FITNESS  function  for  a  GENOME
     representing a timetable involves computing degrees of punishment for
     various problems with the timetable, such as  clashes,  instances  of
     students  having  to  take  consecutive  exams, instances of students
     having (eg) three or more exams in  one  day,  the  degree  to  which
     heavily-subscribed  exams  occur  late  in the timetable (which makes
     marking harder), overall length of timetable, etc. The modular nature
     of the fitness function has the key to the main potential strength of
     using GAs for this sort of thing as  opposed  to  using  conventional
     search  and/or  constraint  programming  methods. The power of the GA
     approach is the ease with which it  can  handle  arbitrary  kinds  of
     constraints  and  objectives;  all  such  things  can  be  handled as
     weighted components of the fitness function, making it easy to  adapt
     the  GA  to  the  particular  requirements  of  a  very wide range of
     possible overall objectives . Very few other timetabling methods, for
     example,  deal with such objectives at all, which shows how difficult
     it is (without  GAs)  to  graft  the  capacity  to  handle  arbitrary
     objectives  onto  the  basic "find shortest- length timetable with no
     clashes" requirement.  The  proper  way  to  weight/handle  different
     objectives  in  the  fitness  function  in relation to the general GA
     dynamics remains, however, an important research problem!
     GAs thus offer a combination of simplicity, flexibility & speed which
     competes  very  favorably  with other approaches, but are unlikely to
     outperform  knowledge-based  (etc)  methods  if  the  best   possible
     solution  is  required at any cost. Even then, however, hybridisation
     may yield the best of both worlds; also, the ease (if the hardware is
     available!)  of implementing GAs in parallel enhances the possibility
     of using them for good, fast solutions to very hard  timetabling  and
     similar problems.

 JOB-SHOP SCHEDULING
     The  Job-Shop  Scheduling  Problem  (JSSP)  is  a  very difficult NP-
     complete problem which, so far, seems best addressed by sophisticated
     branch  and  bound  search  techniques.  GA researchers, however, are
     continuing to make  progress  on  it.   (Davis  85)  started  off  GA
     research  on  the  JSSP,  (Whitley  89)  reports  on  using  the edge
     RECOMBINATION operator (designed initially for the TSP) on JSSPs too.
     More  recent work includes (Nakano 91),(Yamada & Nakano 92), (Fang et
     al. 93).  The latter three  report  increasingly  better  results  on
     using  GAs on fairly large benchmark JSSPs (from Muth & Thompson 63);
     neither consistently outperform branch & bound search yet,  but  seem
     well  on  the  way.  A  crucial  aspect  of such work (as with any GA
     application) is the method used to  encode  schedules.  An  important
     aspect of some of the recent work on this is that better results have
     been obtained by rejecting the conventional wisdom  of  using  binary
     representations   (as  in  (Nakano  91))  in  favor  of  more  direct
     encodings. In (Yamada & Nakano 92), for example,  a  GENOME  directly
     encodes operation completion times, while in (Fang et al. 93) genomes
     represent implicit instructions for building a schedule. The  success
     of  these  latter techniques, especially since their applications are
     very important in industry, should eventually spawn  advances  in  GA
     theory.

     Concerning  the point of using GAs at all on hard job-shop scheduling
     problems, the same goes here as suggested  above  for  `Timetabling':
     The   GA   approach  enables  relatively  arbitrary  constraints  and
     objectives to be incorporated painlessly into a  single  OPTIMIZATION
     method.   It   is  unlikely  that  GAs  will  outperform  specialized
     knowledge-based  and/or  conventional  OR-based  approaches  to  such
     problems  in  terms  of  raw solution quality, however GAs offer much
     greater simplicity and flexibility, and so, for example, may  be  the
     best method for quick high-quality solutions, rather than finding the
     best possible solution at any cost. Also, of course,  hybrid  methods
     will  have a lot to offer, and GAs are far easier to parallelize than
     typical knowledge-based/OR methods.

     Similar to the JSSP is  the  Open  Shop  Scheduling  Problem  (OSSP).
     (Fang  et  al.  93) reports an initial attempt at using GAs for this.
     Ongoing results from the same source shows  reliable  achievement  of
     results  within  less than 0.23% of optimal on moderately large OSSPs
     (so far, up to 20x20), including an  improvement  on  the  previously
     best known solution for a benchmark 10x10 OSSP. A simpler form of job
     shop problem is the Flow-Shop Sequencing problem;  recent  successful
     work on applying GAs to this includes (Reeves 93)."

     Other scheduling problems
     In  contrast  to  job  shop  scheduling  some  maintenance scheduling
     problems consider which  activities  to  schedule  within  a  planned
     maintenance  period,  rather  than seeking to minimise the total time
     taken by the activities. The constraints on which parts may be  taken
     out  of  service  for  maintenance  at  particular  times may be very
     complex, particularly as they will in general interact. Some  initial
     work is given in (Langdon, 1995).

 GAME PLAYING
     GAs can be used to  evolve  behaviors  for  playing  games.  Work  in
     evolutionary  GAME  THEORY  typically  surrounds  the  EVOLUTION of a
     POPULATION of players who meet randomly to play a game in which  they
     each  must  adopt  one  of  a limited number of moves. (Maynard-Smith
     1982).  Let's suppose it is just two moves,  X  and  Y.  The  players
     receive  a reward, analogous to Darwinian FITNESS, depending on which
     combination of moves occurs and which  move  they  adopted.  In  more
     complicated models there may be several players and several moves.

     The  players  iterate such a game a series of times, and then move on
     to a new partner. At the end of all such moves, the players will have
     a cumulative payoff, their FITNESS.  This fitness can then be used as
     a means of conducting something akin to Roulette-Wheel  SELECTION  to
     generate a new POPULATION.

     The  real  key  in  using  a  GA  is  to  come up with an encoding to
     represent player's strategies, one that is amenable to CROSSOVER  and
     to MUTATION.  possibilities are to suppose at each iteration a player
     adopts X with some probability (and Y with one minus such). A  player
     can  thus  be  represented  as  a  real  number,  or  a bit-string by
     interpreting the decimal value of the bit string as  the  inverse  of
     the probability.

     An  alternative  characterisation  is  to model the players as Finite
     State Machines, or Finite Automata (FA). These can be though of as  a
     simple  flow chart governing behaviour in the "next" play of the game
     depending upon previous plays. For example:

	  100 Play X
	  110 If opponent plays X go to 100
	  120 Play Y
	  130 If opponent plays X go to 100 else go to 120
     Represents a strategy that does whatever its opponent did  last,  and
     begins  by  playing  X,  known as "Tit-For-Tat." (Axelrod 1982). Such
     machines can readily be encoded as bit-strings. Consider the encoding
     "1  0  1  0 0 1" to represent TFT.  The first three bits, "1 0 1" are
     state 0. The first bit, "1" is interpreted as "Play  X."  The  second
     bit,  "0"  is interpreted as "if opponent plays X go to state 1," the
     third bit, "1", is interpreted as "if the opponent  plays  Y,  go  to
     state  1."   State 1 has a similar interpretation. Crossing over such
     bit-strings always yields valid strategies.

     SIMULATIONs in the Prisoner's dilemma have been  undertaken  (Axelrod
     1987, Fogel 1993, Miller 1989) of these machines.

     Alternative   representations  of  game  players  include  CLASSIFIER
     SYSTEMs (Marimon, McGrattan and Sargent 1990, [GOLD89]), and  Neural-
     networks  (Fogel and Harrald 1994), though not necessarily with a GA.
     (Fogel  1993),  and  Fogel  and  Harrald  1994  use  an  Evolutionary
     Program).

     Other methods of evolving a POPULATION can be found in Lindgren 1991,
     Glance and Huberman 1993 and elsewhere.

Subject: Q3: Who is concerned with EAs?

     EVOLUTIONARY  COMPUTATION  attracts  researchers  and people of quite
     dissimilar disciplines, i.e.   EC  is  a  interdisciplinary  research
     field:

 Computer scientists
     Want  to  find  out  about the properties of sub-symbolic information
     processing with EAs and about learning,  i.e.   adaptive  systems  in
     general.

     They   also  build  the  hardware  necessary  to  enable  future  EAs
     (precursors are already beginning  to  emerge)  to  huge  real  world
     problems,  i.e. the term "massively parallel computation" [HILLIS92],
     springs to mind.

 Engineers
     Of many kinds want to exploit the capabilities of EAs on  many  areas
     to solve their application, esp.  OPTIMIZATION problems.

 Roboticists
     Want  to  build  MOBOTs (MOBile ROBOTs, i.e. R2D2's and #5's cousins)
     that navigate through uncertain ENVIRONMENTs, without using  built-in
     "maps".   The  MOBOTS  thus  have to adapt to their surroundings, and
     learn what they can do "move-through-door" and what they can't "move-
     through-wall" on their own by "trial-and-error".

 Cognitive scientists
     Might view CFS as a possible apparatus to describe models of thinking
     and cognitive systems.
 Physicists
     Use EC hardware, e.g. Hillis' (Thinking Machine  Corp.'s)  Connection
     Machine  to  model  real  world  problems  which include thousands of
     variables, that run "naturally" in parallel, and thus can be modelled
     more  easily  and  esp.   "faster"  on  a parallel machine, than on a
     serial "PC" one.

 Biologists
     In fact many working biologists  are  hostile  to  modeling,  but  an
     entire   community   of   Population   Biologists   arose   with  the
     'evolutionary synthesis' of the 1930's created by the polymaths  R.A.
     Fisher,  J.B.S.  Haldane, and S. Wright.  Wright's SELECTION in small
     POPULATIONs, thereby avoiding local optima) is of current interest to
     both biologists and ECers -- populations are naturally parallel.

     A  good  exposition  of  current  POPULATION  Biology  modeling is J.
     Maynard Smith's text Evolutionary Genetics.  Richard Dawkin's Selfish
     Gene and Extended Phenotype are unparalleled (sic!) prose expositions
     of  evolutionary  processes.   Rob  Collins'  papers  are   excellent
     parallel  GA  models of evolutionary processes (available in [ICGA91]
     and by FTP from ftp.cognet.ucla.edu:/pub/alife/papers/ ).

     As fundamental motivation, consider Fisher's comment:  "No  practical
     biologist  interested  in  (e.g.) sexual REPRODUCTION would be led to
     work out the detailed consequences experienced  by  organisms  having
     three  or more sexes; yet what else should [s/]he do if [s/]he wishes
     to understand why the sexes are, in fact, always two?"  (Three  sexes
     would make for even weirder grammar, [s/]he said...)

 Philosophers
     and some other really curious people may also be interested in EC for
     various reasons.

Subject: Q4: How many EAs exist? Which?

 The All Stars
     There  are  currently  3  main  paradigms  in  EA  research:  GENETIC
     ALGORITHMs,   EVOLUTIONARY  PROGRAMMING,  and  EVOLUTION  STRATEGIEs.
     CLASSIFIER SYSTEMs and GENETIC PROGRAMMING are OFFSPRING  of  the  GA
     community.   Besides  this  leading  crop,  there  are numerous other
     different approaches, alongside hybrid experiments, i.e. there  exist
     pieces  of software residing in some researchers computers, that have
     been described in papers in conference proceedings, and  may  someday
     prove  useful  on certain tasks. To stay in EA slang, we should think
     of these evolving strands as BUILDING BLOCKs,  that  when  recombined
     someday,  will  produce  new  offspring  and  give  birth  to  new EA
     paradigm(s).

 Promising Rookies
     As far as "solving complex function  and  COMBINATORIAL  OPTIMIZATION
     tasks"  is  concerned, Davis' work on real-valued representations and
     adaptive operators should be mentioned (Davis 89). Moreover Whitley's
     Genitor  system  incorporating  ranking  and "steady state" mechanism
     (Whitley   89),   Goldberg's   "messy   GAs",    involves    adaptive
     representations (Goldberg 91), and Eshelman's CHC algorithm (Eshelman
     91).

     For  "the  design  of  robust  learning  systems",  i.e.  the   field
     characterized  by  CFS, Holland's (1986) CLASSIFIER SYSTEM, with it's
     state-of-the-art implementation CFS-C  (Riolo  88),  we  should  note
     recent  developments  in  SAMUEL  (Grefenstette 89), GABIL (De Jong &
     Spears 91), and GIL (Janikow 91).

Subject: Q4.1: What about Alife systems, like Tierra and VENUS?

     None of these are Evolutionary Algorithms, but all of  them  use  the
     evolutionary metaphor as their "playing field".

 Tierra
     Synthetic organisms have been created based on a computer metaphor of
     organic life in which CPU time is the ``energy'' resource and  memory
     is the ``material'' resource.  Memory is organized into informational
     patterns  that  exploit  CPU  time  for  self-replication.   MUTATION
     generates  new  forms, and EVOLUTION proceeds by natural SELECTION as
     different GENOTYPEs compete for CPU time and memory space.

     Observation of nature shows that EVOLUTION by  natural  SELECTION  is
     capable  of  both  OPTIMIZATION and creativity.  Artificial models of
     evolution have demonstrated the optimizing ability of  evolution,  as
     exemplified by the field of GENETIC ALGORITHMs.  The creative aspects
     of evolution have been more elusive to model.  The difficulty derives
     in  part  from  a  tendency  of  models to specify the meaning of the
     ``genome'' of the evolving entities,  precluding  new  meanings  from
     emerging.   I will present a natural model of evolution demonstrating
     both optimization and creativity, in which  the  GENOME  consists  of
     sequences of executable machine code.

     From  a single rudimentary ancestral ``creature'', very quickly there
     evolve parasites, which  are  not  able  to  replicate  in  isolation
     because  they  lack  a  large  portion of the GENOME.  However, these
     parasites search for the missing information, and if they  locate  it
     in a nearby creature, parasitize the information from the neighboring
     genome, thereby effecting their own replication.

     In some runs, hosts evolve immunity to  attack  by  parasites.   When
     immune  hosts  appear,  they often increase in frequency, devastating
     the parasite POPULATIONs.  In some runs where the community comes  to
     be  dominated by immune hosts, parasites evolve that are resistant to
     immunity.

     Hosts sometimes evolve a  response  to  parasites  that  goes  beyond
     immunity,  to  actual  (facultative)  hyper-parasitism.   The  hyper-
     parasite deceives the parasite causing the  parasite  to  devote  its
     energetic  resources  to  replication  of  the hyper-parastie GENOME.
     This drives the parasites to extinction.  Evolving in the absence  of
     parasites,   hyper-parasites   completely   dominate  the  community,
     resulting in a relatively uniform community characterized by  a  high
     degree    of   relationship   between   INDIVIDUALs.    Under   these
     circumstances, sociality evolves, in the form of creatures which  can
     only replicate in aggregations.

     The  cooperative  behavior  of  the social hyper-parasites makes them
     vulnerable to a new class of parasites.  These cheaters, hyper-hyper-
     parasites,  insert themselves between cooperating social INDIVIDUALs,
     deceiving the social creatures, causing them to replicate the GENOMEs
     of the cheaters.

     The  only genetic change imposed on the simulator is random bit flips
     in the machine code of the creatures.  However,  it  turns  out  that
     parasites  are  very  sloppy  replicators.   They  cause  significant
     RECOMBINATION and rearrangement of  the  GENOMEs.   This  spontaneous
     sexuality  is a powerful force for evolutionary change in the system.

     One of the most interesting aspects of this instance of life is  that
     the  bulk  of  the  EVOLUTION  is  based  on adaptation to the biotic
     ENVIRONMENT rather than the physical environment.  It is co-evolution
     that drives the system.

 VENUS
     Steen Rasmussen's (et al.) VENUS I+II "coreworlds"  as  described  in
     [ALIFEII]  and  [LEVY92],  are  inspired by A.K. Dewdney's well-known
     article (Dewdney 1984). Dewdney proposed a game called  "Core  Wars",
     in  which hackers create computer programs that battle for control of
     a computer's "core" memory (Strack 93).  Since computer programs  are
     just  patterns  of  information, a successful program in core wars is
     one that replicates its pattern within the memory, so that eventually
     most  of  the  memory  contains  its  pattern rather than that of the
     competing program.

     VENUS is a modification of Core Wars in which the  Computer  programs
     can  mutate, thus the pseudo assembler code creatures of VENUS evolve
     steadily.  Furthermore  each  memory   location   is   endowed   with
     "resources"  which,  like  sunshine  are  added at a steady state.  A
     program must have sufficient resources in the regions  of  memory  it
     occupies  in  order  to  execute.   The input of resources determines
     whether the VENUS ecosystem is a "jungle" or a "desert."   In  jungle
     ENVIRONMENTs,  Rasmussen  et al. observe the spontaneous emergence of
     primitive "copy/split" organisms starting  from  (structured)  random
     initial conditions.

     Macintosh  (unless  Word on a PC can read it - I don't know), and you
     may need to do something nasty like use ResEdit to set the file  type
     and  creator to match those of a standard Word document (Type = WDBN,
     Creator = MSWD).  [..]"

Subject: Q5: What about all this Optimization stuff?

     Just  think of an OPTIMIZATION problem as a black box.  A large black
     box. As large as, for example, a Coca-Cola vending machine.  Now,  we
     don't  know  nothing  about  the inner workings of this box, but see,
     that there are some regulators to play with, and of course  we  know,
     that we want to have a bottle of the real thing...

     Putting  this  everyday problem into a mathematical model, we proceed
     as follows:

     (1) we label all the regulators with x and a number starting from  1;
	 the  result  is  a  vector  x, i.e. (x_1,...,x_n), where n is the
	 number of visible regulators.

     (2) we must find an objective function, in this case it's obvious, we
	 want  to  get k bottles of the real thing, where k is equal to 1.
	 [some might want a "greater or equal"  here,  but  we  restricted
	 ourselves to the visible regulators (we all know that sometimes a
	 "kick in the right place" gets use more than 1,  but  I  have  no
	 idea how to put this mathematically...)]

     (3) thus,  in  the  language  some mathematicians prefer to speak in:
	 f(x) = k = 1. So, what we have here  is  a  maximization  problem
	 presented  in  a  form we know from some boring calculus lessons,
	 and  we  also  know  that  there  at  least   a   dozen   utterly
	 uninteresting  techniques to solve problems presented this way...

 What can we do in order to solve this problem?
     We can either try to gain more knowledge or exploit what  we  already
     know  about  the interior of the black box. If the objective function
     turns out to be smooth and differentiable,  analytical  methods  will
     produce the exact solution.

     If  this  turns  out  to  be impossible, we might resort to the brute
     force method of enumerating the entire SEARCH SPACE.   But  with  the
     number  of  possibilities  growing  exponentially in n, the number of
     dimensions (inputs), this method becomes  infeasible  even  for  low-
     dimensional spaces.

     Consequently,  mathematicians  have  developed  theories  for certain
     kinds of problems leading  to  specialized  OPTIMIZATION  procedures.
     These  algorithms  perform  well  if  the  black  box  fulfils  their
     respective prerequisites.  For example, Dantzig's  simplex  algorithm
     (Dantzig  66)  probably  represents  the  best known multidimensional
     method capable of efficiently finding the global optimum of a linear,
     hence  convex, objective function in a SEARCH SPACE limited by linear
     constraints.  (A USENET FAQ on linear programming  is  maintained  by
     John  W.  Gregory  of  Cray  Research,  Inc. Try to get your hands on
     "linear-programming-faq" (and  "nonlinear-programming-faq")  that  is
     posted monthly to sci.op-research and is mostly interesting to read.)

     Gradient strategies are no longer tied to these  linear  worlds,  but
     they  smooth their world by exploiting the objective function's first
     partial derivatives one has to supply in  advance.  Therefore,  these
     algorithms  rely on a locally linear internal model of the black box.

     Newton   strategies   additionally   require   the   second   partial
     derivatives, thus building a quadratic internal model.  Quasi-Newton,
     conjugate gradient and variable metric  strategies  approximate  this
     information during the search.

     The  deterministic  strategies  mentioned  so  far  cannot  cope with
     deteriorations, so the search will stop if  anticipated  improvements
     no  longer  occur.  In a multimodal ENVIRONMENT these algorithms move
     "uphill" from their respective starting points. Hence, they can  only
     converge to the next local optimum.

     Newton-Raphson-methods  might  even  diverge if a discrepancy between
     their internal assumptions and reality occurs.  But of course,  these
     methods  turn  out  to  be  superior  if  a  given task matches their
     requirements. Not relying on derivatives, polyeder strategy,  pattern
     search  and  rotating coordinate search should also be mentioned here
     because they  represent  robust  non-linear  OPTIMIZATION  algorithms
     (Schwefel 81).

     Dealing with technical OPTIMIZATION problems, one will rarely be able
     to write down the objective function in a closed form.  We often need
     a SIMULATION model in order to grasp reality.  In general, one cannot
     even  expect  these  models   to   behave   smoothly.   Consequently,
     derivatives  do  not  exist. That is why optimization algorithms that
     can successfully  deal  with  black  box-type  situations  habe  been
     developed.  The  increasing  applicability is of course paid for by a
     loss of "convergence  velocity,"  compared  to  algorithms  specially
     designed  for  the given problem.  Furthermore, the guarantee to find
     the global optimum no longer exists!

 But why turn to nature when looking for more powerful algorithms?
     In the attempt to create tools  for  various  purposes,  mankind  has
     copied,  more  often instinctively than geniously, solutions invented
     by nature.  Nowadays, one can prove in some cases that certain  forms
     or structures are not only well adapted to their ENVIRONMENT but have
     even reached the optimum (Rosen 67). This is due to the fact that the
     laws  of  nature  have  remained  stable  during the last 3.5 billion
     years. For instance, at branching points the measured  ratio  of  the
     diameters in a system of blood-vessels comes close to the theoretical
     optimum provided by the laws of fluid dynamics  (2^-1/3).   This,  of
     course,  only  represents  a  limited,  engineering  point of view on
     nature. In general, nature performs adaptation, not optimization.

     The idea to imitate basic principles of natural processes for optimum
     seeking  procedures  emerged  more than three decades ago (cf Q10.3).
     Although these  algorithms  have  proven  to  be  robust  and  direct
     OPTIMIZATION  tools, it is only in the last five years that they have
     caught the researchers' attention. This is due to the fact that  many
     people  still look at organic EVOLUTION as a giantsized game of dice,
     thus ignoring the fact that  this  model  of  evolution  cannot  have
     worked:  a human germ-cell comprises approximately 50,000 GENEs, each
     of which consists of about 300 triplets of  nucleic  bases.  Although
     the  four  existing  bases  only  encode  20  different  amino acids,
     20^15,000,000, ie circa 10^19,500,000 different GENOTYPEs had  to  be
     tested in only circa 10^17 seconds, the age of our planet. So, simply
     rolling the dice could not have produced  the  diversity  of  today's
     complex living systems.

     Accordingly,   taking   random   samples  from  the  high-dimensional
     parameter space of an objective function in order to hit  the  global
     optimum  must  fail  (Monte-Carlo  search). But by looking at organic
     EVOLUTION as a  cumulative,  highly  parallel  sieving  process,  the
     results  of  which pass on slightly modified into the next sieve, the
     amazing  diversity  and  efficiency  on  earth  no   longer   appears
     miraculous.  When  building a model, the point is to isolate the main
     mechanisms which have led  to  today's  world  and  which  have  been
     subjected  to  evolution  themselves.  Inevitably, nature has come up
     with a mechanism allowing INDIVIDUALs  of  one  SPECIES  to  exchange
     parts of their genetic information (RECOMBINATION or CROSSOVER), thus
     being able to meet changing environmental conditions in a better way.
