Subject: [2-0] General information about Prolog Implementations

When comparing free and commercial Prolog implementations, a rule of
thumb is that commercial prolog implementations are often more robust
and better supported than the public domain and free prolog
implementations. Commercial Prolog implementations tend to have better
debugging facilities. Many of the commercial Prolog vendors offer
educational discounts to universities, and some of the commercial
Prolog implementations are rather inexpensive. 

When considering a commercial Prolog implementation, be sure to ask
for current pricing information. Although we try to keep this
information up to date, there is no guarantee that it hasn't changed
in the interim. If you find that the information has changed, please
ask the vendor to send us current information.

Some research institutions make their Prolog implementations available
for a fee. We have included those implementations in the lists of
commercial Prolog implementations.

The Prolog Management Group may be contacted by email via the Secretary,
at <info@pap.com>.

Remember when ftping compressed or compacted files (.Z, .arc, .fit,
.zip, .z, etc.) to use binary mode for retrieving the files.

Files that end with a .z suffix were compressed with the patent-free
gzip (no relation to zip). Source for gzip is available from:
   prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/
as the files gzip-1.2.3.shar, gzip-1.2.3.tar,or gzip-1.2.3.msdos.exe.

Subject: [2-1] Free Prolog Implementations

The following list of free Prolog and logic programming implementations
excludes those listed in the comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.scheme FAQs
(i.e., Prolog interpreters written in Lisp and Scheme).

Most of these Prolog implementations are available from the CMU AI
Repository, in the directory
   ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/impl/


A.D.A. Public Domain Prolog:
   aisun1.ai.uga.edu:ai.prolog/adapdpro.zip

   A rather slow implementation of Prolog for MS-DOS systems, originally
   a product of Automata Design Associates (now defunct), 1570
   Arran Way, Dresker, PA 19025, 215-335-5400. 

Aquarius Prolog:
   Aquarius Prolog is a high-performance, portable Prolog implementation
   developed since 1989 by the Aquarius Project at UC/Berkeley, the Advanced
   Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACAL) at the University of Southern
   California (USC), and at Digital Equipment Corporation's Paris Research
   Laboratory. The developers are Tom Getzinger, Ralph Clarke Haygood, and
   Peter Van Roy. Aquarius Prolog includes:

      - A compiler with global analysis.  The compiler is built around the
        Berkeley Abstract Machine (BAM) execution model for Prolog. BAM
        retains desirable features of the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM),
        but allows for significant further optimizations and is easier to
        map onto actual general-purpose machines.

      - A back-end that maps the BAM onto various actual general-purpose
        machines, including MIPS R3000 (DEC Ultrix and MIPS RISC/os),
        SPARC (SunOS), HP 9000 300/400 with MC68020, MC68030 or MC68040
        processors (HP-UX), and Sun3 (SunOS).

      - A run-time system offering substantially the same built-in 
        predicates and memory management as Quintus Prolog, with additions 
        such as two kinds of destructive assignment.  Most of the built-in 
        predicates are written in Prolog, with little or no performance 
        penalty.

   Aquarius Prolog also includes an interpreter and documentation.
   Aquarius Prolog comes in two distributions, Enduser and Full. The
   latter includes full source code and implementation notes.

   Aquarius Prolog may be obtained free of charge from USC, after signing 
   and returning a license agreement. To get the license agreement, send a
   message to listserv@acal-server.usc.edu with 
      get aquarius-info license
   in the message body. To get more information about the Full and
   Enduser distributions, send the listserver a message containing
   one or both of the two lines: 
           get aquarius-info readme-full
           get aquarius-info readme-enduser
   To subscribe to the aquarius-prolog mailing list, send the listserver a
   message with body: 
           subscribe aquarius-prolog <Your real name here>
   To get more information about the abilities of the listserver, send it a
   message with 'help' in the body.

   For further information, write to University of Southern California,
   Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory (ACAL), Attn: Aquarius Prolog

   send email to aquarius@acal-server.usc.edu.

Beta-Prolog (version 1.2):

   Beta-Prolog is a fast and portable Prolog implementation. It consists 
   of an emulator of the NTOAM (matching Tree Oriented Abstract Machine)
   written in C, a compiler written in Prolog that translates Prolog
   programs into NTOAM instructions, and a library of built-in
   predicates. 

   Beta-Prolog has the following features:

      1. It is one of the fastest emulator-based Prolog implementations.
	 The NTOAM inherits many good features of the WAM, but differs from
	 WAM-based systems in that predicate arguments are passed directly
	 in stack frames and only one frame is used for each predicate. For
	 many programs written for WAM-based systems, Beta-Prolog is faster
	 than emulator-based SICStus Prolog 2.1. Further speed-ups can be
	 achieved if these programs are rewritten into a style suitable for
	 Beta-Prolog by taking the NTOAM's argument passing scheme into
	 account.

      2. Besides Edinburgh style clauses, Beta-Prolog also accepts
	 matching clauses in which input and output unifications are
	 separated, and determinism is denoted explicitly. The compiler is
	 able to translate predicates in this form into matching trees and
	 index them using all input arguments. The compiler can compile
	 quite large programs in a short time because it consists of only
	 matching clauses.
   
      3. It provides an interactive interface through which the
         programmers can consult, compile, load, debug and run programs.
   
      4. It provides an interface through which C functions can be
         called from Prolog. 

      5. It provides a special data structure called state tables that
	 can be used to represent graphs, simple and complex domains in
	 constraint satisfaction problems, and situations in various
	 combinatorial search problems.

      6. It includes a finite-domain constraint solver with which 
         constraint satisfaction problems can be specified declaratively. 

   Beta-Prolog is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.kyutech.ac.jp:/pub/Language/prolog/ [131.206.1.101]
   or from the CMU AI Repository in
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/impl/prolog/beta_pl/
   The system can be installed without difficulty on any machine that
   runs Unix and the cc (or gcc) C compiler. Beta-Prolog was developed by
   Neng-Fa Zhou, <zhou@mse.kyutech.ac.jp>, Faculty of Computer Science
   and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, 680-4 Kawazu,
   Iizuka, Fukuoka 820, Japan, phone 81-948-29-7774, fax 81-948-29-7760.
   For more information, send mail to betaprolog@cad.mse.kyutech.ac.jp.
   
BinProlog:
   clement.info.umoncton.ca:/BinProlog3.0.tar.gz [139.103.16.2]
   ftp.elis.rug.ac.be:/pub/BinProlog/        [157.193.67.1]

   BinProlog replaces the WAM by a more compact continuation passing logic
   engine based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic programs.  It
   includes an interface Tcl/Tk. Version 2.20 runs on Sparc, DEC Alpha,
   MIPS (SGI, DEC) 68k (NeXT, Sun3), R6000 (IBM), PA-RISC (HP) and IBM PC
   (386/486). The compiler makes 528 KLIPS on a Sparc 10-40 (101 KLIPS on a
   NeXT) and still uses a very small (49K under Solaris 2.1) emulator,
   making it among the fastest freely available C-emulated Prologs (3-5
   times faster than C-Prolog, 2-3 times faster than SWI-Prolog, 1.5-2
   times faster than (X)SB-prolog and close to C-emulated Sicstus 2.1.).
   Comments and bug reports should be sent to Paul Tarau
   <binprolog@info.umoncton.ca>.

   BinProlog is free for reasearch and other non-profit purposes.  Use in
   industrial applications, licensing of C-sources, porting to other
   platforms, BinProlog related support and consulting are available but
   need a separate agreement. BinProlog's very small code-size and high
   performances make it suitable to be integrated in industrial
   C-applications that need the services of an embedded logic
   programming engine. 

Boizumault Prolog:
   The various Prolog interpreters described in Patrice Boizumault's
   book, "The Implementation of Prolog", are available by anonymous
   ftp from
      cnam.cnam.fr:/pub/Boizumault/
   or from the CMU AI Repository in
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/impl/prolog/boiz_pl/
   The three interpreters, corresponding to appendices A through D of
   the book, are written in Common Lisp. Examples which run in all the
   interpreters include cryptarithms, Eliza, Sieve of Eratosthenes,
   Factorial, N-Queens, and Quicksort. For more information, write to 
   Patrice Boizumault <boizu@math-appli-uco.fr>.

ECLiPSe (ECRC Logic Programming System) combines the functionalities
of several ECRC systems, including SEPIA (an Edinburgh-style
extensible Prolog system based on a WAM compiler), MegaLog (a database
system) and CHIP (a constraint logic programming system).  ECLiPSe
includes a Prolog compiler with extended functionality that is Quintus
and SICStus compatible, a tightly connected database system based on
the BANG file system, a CLP system, and an interface to the Tcl/Tk X11
toolkit. The BANG database can store not only relations, but also any
Prolog structures and programs. The CLP system contains several
libraries with various types of constraint handling schemes, including
atomic finite domains, linear rational constraints, CHR (constraint
handling rules) and Propia (generalised propagation).  It also
supports writing further extensions like new user-defined constraints
or complete new constraint solvers.  ECLiPSe also includes a profiler,
user-definable syntax, metaterms as first-class citizens, coroutining,
a high-level debugger (OPIUM), a partial evaluation system (PADDY),
and unlimited precision integer and rational numbers. ECLiPSe is
available for a nominal fee of DM 300 (~$200) to all academic and
government-sponsored organizations. It is distributed in binary form
for Sun-3 and Sparc machines. Send orders or requests for further
information to eclipse_request@ecrc.de or write to ECRC,
Arabellastrasse 17, 81925 Munich, Germany. The ECLiPSe documentation
(ASCII and dvi) and some shareware packages ported to ECliPSe are now
available by anonymous ftp from
   ecrc.de:/pub/eclipse
To subscribe to the eclipse_users@ecrc.de mailing list, send mail to  
eclipse_request@ecrc.de. The tech support email address is
eclipse_bugs@ecrc.de. 

eLP (Ergo Lambda Prolog) is an interpreter written by Conal Elliott,
Frank Pfenning and Dale Miller in Common Lisp and implements the core
of lambda Prolog (higher-order hereditary Harrop formulas). It is
embedded in a larger development environment called ESS (the Ergo
Support System).  eLP implements all core language feature and offers
a module system, I/O, some facilities for tracing, error handling,
arithmetic, recursive top-levels, on-line documentation and a number
of extended examples, including many programs from Amy Felty's and
John Hannan's thesis.  It should run in Allegro Common Lisp, Lucid
Common Lisp, Kyoto Common Lisp, CMU Common Lisp and Ibuki Common Lisp.
The eLP implementation of lambda Prolog is no longer developed or
maintained, but it is still available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ergo/export/ess/. The file
ergolisp.tar.Z contains the Ergo project's extensions to Common Lisp,
including some facilities for attributes and dealing with abstract
syntax trees. The file sb.tar.Z contains the Ergo
Parser/Unparser/Formatter generator and ab.tar.Z contains the Ergo
Attribute Grammar facility. The file elp.tar.Z contains the Ergo
implementation of lambda Prolog.  To customize grammars you need the
sb.tar.Z file.  When you retrieve the system, please print, fill out,
and send in a copy of the non-restrictive license you will find in the
file LICENSE. To subscribe to the elp@cs.cmu.edu mailing list, send
mail to elp-request@cs.cmu.edu. Bugs should be sent to
elp-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.

ESL Prolog-2 (PD Version):
   ai.uga.edu:ai.prolog/eslpdpro.zip [128.192.12.9]

   A prolog for MS-DOS systems with good performance. It deviates
   slightly from Edinburgh standard (strings "like this" are not lists
   of ASCII codes), but you can add a declaration that makes it fully 
   Edinburgh-compatible. (Add the line
        :- state(token_class,_,dec10).
   at the beginning of the program.) It is a more limited version
   of the interpreter from the Commercial Version (see [2-2] below).
   [Please note that ESL Prolog is NOT a UGA product, they just run
   the machine on which a copy is made available. Anyone with
   questions should contact ESL in Oxford, England (see [2-2] below).
   The commercial version of ESL Prolog-2 has been sold to ESI.]

   Documentation is available as a 2-volume set published by Ablex
   (type "prolog2" for info). ESL Prolog is also discussed
   extensively in Tony Dodd's book "Prolog: A Logical Approach,"
   Oxford University Press. 

GOEDEL is intended to be a declarative successor to Prolog.  The main
design aim of Goedel is to have functionality and expressiveness
similar to Prolog, but to have greatly improved declarative semantics
compared with Prolog.  This improved declarative semantics has
substantial benefits for program construction, verification,
debugging, transformation, and so on. Considerable emphasis is placed
on Goedel's meta-logical facilities, since this is where Prolog is
most deficient.  In particular, Goedel has declarative replacements
for Prolog's var, nonvar, assert, and retract.  Goedel is a strongly
typed language, its type system being based on many-sorted logic with
parametric polymorphism. It has a module system, and supports floating
point numbers and infinite precision integers and rationals. It can
solve constraints over finite domains of integers and also linear
rational constraints. It supports processing of finite sets.  It also
has a flexible computation rule and a pruning operator which
generalises the commit of the concurrent logic programming languages.
The release includes the Goedel system, the SAGE partial evaluator for
Goedel, a user manual, and 50 example programs.  Goedel must be
compiled in SICStus Prolog 2.1 #6 or later; Sparc and Linux
executables are included in the distribution.  Goedel is available by
anonymous ftp from 
   ftp.cs.kuleuven.ac.be:/pub/logic-prgm/goedel/ [134.58.41.2] 
   ftp.cs.bris.ac.uk:/goedel [137.222.102.102]
For more information, write to goedel@compsci.bristol.ac.uk. Please
send an email message to this address (with your name, institution and
address) to this address when you obtain the system. To subscribe to
the goedel-users@compsci.bristol.ac.uk mailing list, send mail to
  goedel-users-request@compsci.bristol.ac.uk
indicating that you wish to join the Goedel discussion group.
A book describing the language is now available from MIT Press:
   Patricia Hill and John Lloyd, "The Godel Programming Language",
   MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1994. ISBN 0-262-08229-2 ($45.00).

IC-Prolog II:
   src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/computing/programming/languages/prolog/icprolog/.
   The emulator is available at present only in Sun-4 binary form.
   Source code may be released later in the year when project
   finishes. 

   Produced by Imperial College, IC-Prolog II is a multi-threaded
   Prolog system.  It includes a Parlog sub-system, an interface to
   TCP primitives and "mailboxes", a high level communication
   system.  These enable distributed applications (such as
   client/server systems) to be written using logic programming.
   The distribution also includes a simple expert system shell and
   the preprocessor for the Prolog language extension L&O from the
   book "Logic & Objects" by Frank McCabe.  (The sources for the
   L&O extension is also available to LPA MacProlog users in the
   subdirectory 'lo'.)

   See "I.C. Prolog II : a Multi-threaded Prolog System" by Damian
   Chu and Keith Clark and also "IC Prolog II: a Language for
   Implementing Multi-Agent Systems" by Damian Chu.  Postscript
   copies of these two papers may be found in the subdirectory
   'papers'.

   Standalone versions of the Parlog system for Sun-3 and Sun-4
   can also be found in this directory.

Prolog/Mali is a compiler for the higher-order language Lambda-Prolog.
Lambda-Prolog is an extension of Prolog defined by Miller (Miller,
D.A., and Nadathur, G., "Higher-order logic programming", 3rd
International Conference on Logic Programming, pages 448-462, London
1986). It is an extension of Prolog where terms are simply typed
lambda terms and clauses are higher order hereditary Harrop formulas.
The main novelties are universal quantification on goals and
implication.  Prolog/Mali is a complete system which includes a C
translator, a linker, libraries, runtime, and documentation, and runs
on UNIX.  It requires the MALI-V06 abstract memory package.
Prolog/Mali is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.irisa.fr:/local/pm/.
Written by Pascal Brisset <pbrisset@eis.enac.dgac.fr> (or <brisset@ecrc.de>)
and Olivier Ridoux (ridoux@irisa.fr). To be added to the mailing list,
send mail to prolog-mali-request@irisa.fr. For more information, send
mail to pm@irisa.fr.

LIFE (Logic, Inheritance, Functions, and Equations) is an experimental
programming language with a powerful facility for structured type
inheritance. It reconciles styles from functional programming, logic
programming, and object-oriented programming. It subsumes the
functionality of its precursor languages LOGIN and Le_Fun, and may be
seen as an extension of Prolog. The syntax of Wild_LIFE has been kept
as close as possible to that of the Edinburgh standard for Prolog.
LIFE offers natively high-level abstraction facilities and convenient
data and control structures particularly well-suited for AI
programming. LIFE implements a constraint logic programming language
with equality (unification) and entailment (matching) constraints over
order-sorted feature terms. The interplay of unification and matching
provides an implicit coroutining facility thanks to an automatic
suspension mechanism. This allows interleaving interpretation of
relational and functional expressions which specify structural
dependencies on objects. The Wild_LIFE interpreter is the first
implementation of the LIFE language available to the general public.
It is a product of Digital Equipment Corporation's Paris Research
Laboratory (DEC PRL). Wild_LIFE runs on MIPS/Ultrix (DECstations),
Alpha/OSF-1, SPARC/SunOS, RS/6000, and SGI machines, and should 
be portable to other Unix workstations. It is implemented in C,
and includes an interface to X Windows. Wild_LIFE is available
by anonymous ftp from gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/plan as the file
Life1.0.tar.Z. To be added to the mailing list (life-users@cs.sfu.ca),
send mail to life-users-request@cs.sfu.ca. Send bug reports to
life-bugs@cs.sfu.ca. 

Open Prolog: 
   Open Prolog (OP) is a Prolog interpreter for the Apple Macintosh.

   It follows the so-called 'Edinburgh' syntax and supports most standard
   Prolog features, including Definite Clause Grammars.
   Extra predicates can be added via drop-in external predicates, similar to
   Hypercard's XCMDs.

   OP will work in any Macintosh from a Macintosh Plus, and runs in
   emulated mode on Power Macs.

   The most recent version of Open Prolog is available by anonymous ftp
   from its home site:
      ftp.cs.tcd.ie:/languages/open-prolog/ [134.226.32.15] 
   It is also available from other sites, such as:
      sumex-aim.stanford.edu:/info-mac/
      mac.archive.umich.edu [141.211.165.41].

Qu-Prolog 3.2 and Ergo 4.0:

   Qu-Prolog is a high-level language designed primarily for rapid
   prototyping of interactive theorem provers and, more generally, for
   symbolic computation on formal languages.  Its object level includes
   quantified terms and object variables.  As an example, the interactive
   theorem prover Ergo 4.0 is implemented in Qu-Prolog.  The compactness
   and high level of Ergo 4.0 source code demonstrate the advantages of
   Qu-Prolog for such applications. Ergo includes a 'window inference'
   method that is specifically designed to support hierarchical
   goal-directed proofs and allow easy access to the context of a
   subterm. Ergo also provides support for defining a variety of logics
   and support for proving schematic theorems and answer extraction.
   Ergo is being used to support the development of verified software.
   The system has been tested only on a Sun4.
   Qu-Prolog and Ergo are available by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cs.uq.oz.au:/pub/SVRC/
   as software/qp.tar.Z and software/Ergo.tar. The tech report
   techreports/tr93-18.ps.Z describes Qu-Prolog in detail. Send comments
   to Peter Robinson <pjr@cs.uq.oz.au>.

SB-Prolog:
   cs.arizona.edu:/sbprolog
   sbcs.sunysb.edu:/pub/sbprolog

   Stony Brook Prolog runs on Sun4, Pyramid-98x, DEC3100, SGI Iris,
   Amiga, and MS-DOS machines. Contact warren@sbcs.sunysb.edu for more
   information. Two versions are available: version 2.5 is an
   interpreter for Amigas and version 3.1 is an interpreter and compiler
   for Unix and MSDOS/386.

   SB-Hilog runs in SB-Prolog and Quintus Prolog and is available on
      sbcs.sunysb.edu:/pub/hilog/

   src.doc.ic.ac.uk [146.169.2.10] contains SBProlog 3.1 executables for
   MS-DOS/386 in /computing/programming/languages/prolog/sbprolog,
   filename sbpmsdos.zip. 

   nic.funet.fi contains SBProlog executables for Amiga in
   /pub/amiga/fish/disks100-199/ff140. 

   Modular SB-Prolog (= SB-Prolog version 3.1 plus modules) is available
   by anonymous FTP from 
      ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk:/pub/dts/mod-prolog.tar.Z [129.215.160.5]
   Includes interpreter for SPARC. For more information, write to
   Brian Paxton <mprolog@dcs.ed.ac.uk>. 

   [NOTE: SB-Prolog is superseded by XSB (see below) and hence is
    no longer supported by Stony Brook or the University of Arizona.
    The only reason to continue using SB-Prolog is for DOS, since
    XSB does not run under DOS and there are currently no plans to
    port it to DOS.]

SLG:
   The SLG system is a meta interpreter implementation of 
   goal-oriented deductive query processing and non-monotonic 
   reasoning with the following features:
       * goal-oriented query evaluation of normal logic programs 
         under the well-founded semantics by Van Gelder, Ross 
         and Schliph;
       * goal-oriented query evaluation of general logic programs 
         under the alternating fixpoint logic by Van Gelder, with 
         the restriction that the body of a clause has to be either
         an existential conjunction of literals or a universal 
         disjunction of literals.
       * goal-oriented query evaluation under the stable model semantics
         by Gelfond and Lifchitz.
       * integration with Prolog execution, and the use of Prolog syntax 
         for all programs.

WAMCC 2.2 is a WAM-based Prolog to C compiler.  It conforms more or
less to the Edinburgh standard, and includes most of the usual
built-in predicates, a top-level, a Prolog debugger and a WAM
debugger. WAMCC is designed to be easily extended (see clp(FD) in
[2-5], for example). WAMCC's speed is halfway between SICStus emulated
and SICStus native code on a Sparc (1.5 times faster and 1.5 times
slower, respectively). WAMCC requires GCC 2.4.5 or higher and has been
tested on Sparc workstations. It should be easily ported to 32-bit
machines with GCC. WAMCC is available free by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/ChLoE/LOGIC_PROGRAMMING/wamcc/

XSB is a Prolog-based Logic Programming System that extends the
standard functionality of Prolog with an implementation of OLDT
(tabling) and HiLog terms. It is a descendent of PSB-Prolog and
SB-Prolog. OLDT resolution is useful for recursive query computation,
allowing programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog
does not. HiLog supports a type of higher-order programming in which
predicate symbols can be variable or structured.  This allows
unification to be performed on the predicate symbols themselves in
addition to the arguments of the predicates. XSB includes an
optimizing compiler, C interface, a module system, list processing
libraries, and dynamic loading.  XSB is a descendant of SB-Prolog.
XSB runs on Sun3, Sun4, 386/486 PCs (Linux and 386 BSD), SGI machines
(IRIX), HP 300/400 series (HP-UX) and NeXT, and can be compiled using
either the GNU C compiler or the Sun C compiler. Porting XSB to any
32-bit machine running Unix should be straightforward.  THIS IS A BETA
RELEASE. XSB is available by anonymous ftp from
   sbcs.sunysb.edu:/pub/XSB/XSB.tar.Z [130.245.1.15]
For more information, write to XSB Research Group, Computer Science
Department, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794, or send email to

FRIL (Fuzzy Relational Inference Language) is a logic-programming
language that incorporates a consistent method for handling
uncertainty, based on Baldwin's theories of support logic, mass
assignments, and evidential reasoning. Mass assignments give a
consistent way of manipulating fuzzy and probabilistic uncertainties,
enabling different forms of uncertainty to be integrated within a
single framework. Fril has a list-based syntax, similar to the early
micro-Prolog from LPA. Prolog is a special case of Fril, in which
programs involve no uncertainty. Fril runs on Unix, Macintosh, MS-DOS,
and Windows 3.1 platforms. For further information, write to Dr B.W.
Pilsworth, Fril Systems Ltd, Bristol Business Centre, Maggs House, 78
Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1QX, UK. A longer description is available as

optimization techniques including Tail Recursion Optimisation, First
Argument Indexing/Hashing, In-line Arithmetic Evaluation and automatic
Garbage Collection of code and data. Error handling is based on catch
and throw mechanisms. GT-Prolog is also one of the first implementations
to support a fully logical Prolog database.  GT-Prolog provides explicit
control of memory allocation allowing programs to use up to 16mb for
data and 4gb for code and requires a minimum configuration of 1Mb memory
plus Workbench version 2 or later.  GT-Prolog includes a library of more
than 120 predicates that provide user programs with access to the

Subject: [2-3] Free Parallel Prolog Implementations

This section contains free parallel Prolog and logic programming
implementations. 

BAP:
   Brain Aid Prolog (BAP) is a Concurrent Sequential Processes (CSP)
   based standard Prolog for Transputer networks. BAP uses its own MS
   Windows or X Windows server for I/O. Special features include
   automatic topology adapation and concurrent source level debugging
   (see several processes exchange messages). Performance is pretty high,
   comparable to that of other Prolog compilers. BAP has achieved good
   results (>80% efficiency) when executing applications like N-queens or
   checkers in parallel on an 8 processor network. A demo version that
   supports Transputer systems with a maximum of 2 processors is
   available by anonymous ftp from 
      unlisys.in-berlin.de:/pub/brainaid/
   and also from the CMU AI Repository, in
      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/lang/prolog/impl/parallel/bap/
   A full version for up to 128 nodes is also available for both SUN and
   PC. Write to Frank Bergmann <fraber@cs.tu-berlin.de> or 
   <bap_info@brainaid.in-berlin.de> for more information. 

BeBOP:
   The BeBOP language combines sequential and parallel Logic Programming
   (LP), object oriented programming and meta-level programming. The LP
   component offers both don't know non-determinism and stream AND
   parallelism, a combination not possible with concurrent LP languages.
   BeBOP's object oriented features include object IDs, encapsulation,
   message passing, state updating, and object behaviour modification.
   The meta-level capabilities are based on the treatment of Prolog
   theories as first order entities, which enables them to be updated
   easily and lets fragments to be passed between objects in messages.
   BeBOP is implemented by translation down to NU-Prolog, and its
   parallel extension, PNU-Prolog.  The BeBOP system (BeBOP and bp) and
   the PNU-Prolog preprocessor pnp can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
   munnari.oz.au:/pub/bebop.tar.Z [128.250.1.21].  The release comes with
   a user manual, several papers (in Postscript format), sample programs,
   and source code.  The BeBOP system requires the NU-Prolog system,
   compiler and interpreter, the pnp preprocessor (which is included as
   part of the BeBOP system release), GCC or a similar compiler, Yacc (or
   Bison) and Lex. For more information, contact Andrew Davison,
   <ad@cs.mu.oz.au>, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Melbourne,
   Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia, call +61 3-287-9172/9101, or fax
   +61 3-348-1184.

KLIC:
   KLIC is a portable implementation of KL1 (an extended Flat GHC), a
   concurrent logic programming language developed at ICOT in Japan.
   Runs on Suns, HPs, DECs, and Linux PC's and marks 2 MLIPS on
   SparcStation 10/30 and 4MLIPS on system with 200MHz Alpha.  A
   sequential version available via anonymous ftp from ftp.icot.or.jp.
   Parallel versions planned shortly.  A representative paper on the
   language is Kazunori Ueda and Takashi Chikayama, "Design of the
   Kernel Language for the Parallel Inference Machine", The Computer
   Journal, December, 1990.  A paper on its KLIC implementation is
   Takashi Chikayama, Tetsuro Fujise and Daigo Sekita, "A Portable and
   Efficient Implementation of KL1", PLILP'94 (LNCS #844,
   Springer-Verlag).  For more information, send an email to
   klic-requests@icot.or.jp or write to ICOT Free Software Desk,

   Kokusai Bldg., 4-28, Mita 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan, fax
   +81-3-3456-1618.

Multi-BinProlog:
   Multi-BinProlog 2.00 is a prototype Linda-style parallel extension to
   BinProlog 1.71 developed by Koen De Bosschere and Paul Tarau. It uses
   Koen's C-parser and C-writer which together speed-up IO considerably.
   It works with shared-memory and remote procedure calls and is
   available from clement.info.umoncton.ca:MultiBinProlog/
   See BinProlog in [2-1] for more information.

NCL:
   NCL (Net-Clause Language) is aimed at describing distributed
   computation models using term unification as a basic processing and
   control mechanism. It is embedded in standard Prolog and comprises two
   parts -- net-clauses and data-driven rules, which can communicate each
   to other and to standard Prolog programs.  A net-clause is a special
   domain in the database defining a network of nodes and links. The
   nodes are represented by Prolog compound terms. The variables
   occurring within the nodes are global logical variables, which can be
   shared within the scope of the net-clause thus playing the role of
   network links.  Two control mechanisms are implemented: a spreading
   activation scheme similar to the connectionist spreading activation
   and to the marker passing mechanism in SN (in logic programming it is
   seen as a restricted forward chaining) and a default mechanism based
   on using variables to propagate terms without being bound to them,
   thus implementing the non-monotonicity of default reasoning.  The
   Data-driven Rules implement a full scale forward chaining for Horn
   clauses.  They simulate a data-driven parallel computation, where each
   rule is a process (in contrast to the traditional parallel logic
   programming where each goal is a process). The NCL/Prolog interpreter
   along with a reference manual and a set of examples is available by
   anonymous ftp at ai.uga.edu:/pub/misc/ncl.tar.Z. For more information
   contact Zdravko Markov, Institute of Informatics, Bulgarian Academy of
   Sciences Acad.G.Bonchev Street, Block 29A, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria,
   <markov@iinf.bg>.

PCN:
   PCN (Program Composition Notation) is not a logic programming
   language, but it has similarities to Strand and other concurrent logic
   programming languages. PCN is a parallel programming system that
   provides a simple language for specifying concurrent algorithms,
   interfaces to Fortran and C, a portable toolkit that allows
   applications to be developed on a workstation or small parallel
   computer and run unchanged on supercomputers, and integrated debugging
   and performance analysis tools. PCN includes a runtime system,
   compiler, linker, a set of standard libraries, virtual topology tools,
   a symbolic debugger (PDB), an execution profiler (Gauge), and a trace
   analysis tool (Upshot). PCN was developed at Argonne National
   Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology.  PCN runs on
   Sun4, NeXT, IBM RS/6000, SGI Iris, Intel iPSC/860, Intel Touchstone
   DELTA, Sequent Symmetry running Dynix (not PTX), and should be easy to
   port to other architectures. PCN is in the public domain and can be
   obtained by anonymous ftp from
      info.mcs.anl.gov:/pub/pcn/pcn_v2.0.tar.Z 
   The distribution includes a user's guide containing a tutorial and
   reference material. For further information on PCN, please send email to

Subject: [2-5] Free Constraint Systems

This section contains constraint systems, constraint logic programming
systems, concurrent constraint languages, and other constraint
processing systems.

CIAL:

   CIAL 1.0b is an interval constraint logic programming language. The main
   difference between CIAL and other CLP(Interval) languages is that a
   linear constraint solver, which is based on preconditioned interval
   Gauss-Seidel method, is embedded in CIAL in addition to the interval
   narrowing solver. 

   The main motivations for a linear solver are:

      * Pure interval narrowing fails to narrow the intervals to any useful 
	width even for such simple systems as {X+Y=5, X-Y=6}.  Interval
	splitting may help but is costly.

      * Pure interval narrowing cannot always detect inconsistency or halt
	(in a reasonable time).  A simple example is {A+1=D, A+B=D, A>0, B<0}.

      * Efficient linear constraint solver is also important to the study of
	efficient non-linear constraint-solving.  Recent results show that 
	interval Newton method works better than pure interval narrowing for 
	solving non-linear constraints, but may require to solve many linear
	constraints in order to give the best results.

   This version of CIAL prototype is implemented as an extension to CLP(R)
   v1.2 and tested on Sun Sparc machines. You should have obtained CLP(R)
   from IBM prior to installing CIAL. The distribution is in the form of
   patches to the CLP(R) sources. [See entry on CLP(R) below].
   Send email to cial@cs.cuhk.hk to request CIAL, and for more details.

   Relevant papers include

      C.K. Chiu and J.H.M. Lee, "Towards practical interval constraint solving
      in logic programming", in Proceedings of the Eleventh International
      Logic Programming Symposium, Ithaca, NY, USA, November 1994 (to appear).

      constraint logic programming and the multiple-trailing problem", in
      Proceedings Sixth IEEE International Conference on Tools with
      Artificial Intelligence, New Orleans, Nov 1994.

cu-Prolog:
   cu-Prolog is an experimental constraint logic programming language
   available free from Japan's Institute for New Generation Computer
   Technology (ICOT). Unlike most conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog
   allows user-defined predicates as constraints and is suitable for
   implementing a natural language processing system based on the
   unification-based grammar. For example, the cu-Prolog developers
   implemented a JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar) parser in
   cu-Prolog with the JPSG Working Group (the chairman is Prof. GUNJI,
   Takao of Osaka University) at ICOT. cu-Prolog is a complete
   implementation of Constraint Unification (cu), hence the name.
   cu-Prolog is implemented in C for BSD UNIX 4.2/3. Professor Sirai of
   Chukyo-University has also implemented cu-Prolog for the Apple
   Macintosh and DJ's GPP (80386/486 MS-DOS machine with the DOS
   extender). cu-Prolog is available free by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.icot.or.jp. For further information, send email to ifs@icot.or.jp,
   or write to ICOT Free Software Desk, Institute for New Generation
   Computer Technology, 21st Floor, Mita Kokusai Bldg., 4-28, Mita
   1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108, Japan, fax +81-3-3456-1618.

clp(FD):
   clp(FD) 2.2 is a constraint logic programming language over finite
   domains and booleans based on the wamcc Prolog compiler (see [2-1]).
   clp(FD) provides several constraints "a la CHIP" on finite domains and
   booleans and some facilities for building new constraints. clp(FD) is
   4 times faster than CHIP v3.2 on average.  clp(FD) requires GCC 2.4.5
   or higher and has been tested on Sparc workstations, DEC (Ultrix),
   Sony MIPS (R3000), and 386/486 PCs under linux. It should be
   easily ported to 32-bit machines with GCC.  clp(FD) is available free
   by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.inria.fr:/INRIA/Projects/ChLoE/LOGIC_PROGRAMMING/clp_fd/
   For more information, write to Daniel Diaz <Daniel.Diaz@inria.fr>,
   INRIA Rocquencourt, FRANCE.

CLP(R):
   CLP(R) is a constraint logic programming language with real-arithmetic
   constraints.  The implementation contains a built-in constraint solver
   which deals with linear arithmetic and contains a mechanism for delaying
   nonlinear constraints until they become linear.  Since CLP(R) subsumes
   PROLOG, the system is also usable as a general-purpose logic programming
   language. It includes facilities for meta-programming with constraints.
   The system consists of a compiler, byte-code emulator, and constraint
   solver. CLP(R) is written entirely in C and runs on Suns, Vaxen,
   MIPS-based machines (Decstations, Silicon Graphics), IBM RS6000s and
   PS2s. Includes MS-DOS support. It is available free from IBM for 
   academic and research purposes only. To get a copy, write
   to Joxan Jaffar, H1-D48, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center,
   P.O. Box 704, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, or send email to
   joxan@watson.ibm.com or joxan@yktvmh.bitnet. Current version 1.2.
   For more information, write to Joxan or Roland Yap
   <roland@bruce.cs.monash.edu.au>.

OZ:
   Oz is a concurrent constraint programming language designed for
   applications that require complex symbolic computations, organization
   into multiple agents, and soft real-time control.  It is based on a
   computation model that provides a uniform foundation for higher-order
   functional programming, constraint logic programming, and concurrent
   objects with multiple inheritance.  From functional languages Oz
   inherits full compositionality, and from logic languages Oz inherits
   logic variables and constraints (including feature and finite domain
   constraints). Search in Oz is encapsulated (no backtracking) and
   includes one, best and all solution strategies.

   DFKI Oz is an interactive implementation of Oz featuring a programming
   interface based on GNU Emacs, a concurrent browser, an object-oriented
   interface to Tcl/Tk, powerful interoperability features (sockets, C,
   C++), an incremental compiler, a garbage collector, and support for
   stand-alone applications.  Performance is competitive with commercial
   Prolog and Lisp systems.  DFKI Oz is available for many platforms
   running Unix/X, including Sparcs and 486 PCs.

   Applications DFKI Oz has already been used for include simulations,
   multi-agent systems, natural language processing, virtual reality,

Subject: [2-6] Commercial Constraint Systems

This section contains constraint systems, constraint logic programming
systems, concurrent constraint languages, and other constraint
processing systems.

CHIP V4 (Constraint Handling In Prolog) is designed as an extension to
Prolog offering three constraint solving domains: Integers, Rationals
and Booleans. The system was originally developed at ECRC in Munich
and now extended by the same team at COSYTEC in Paris. CHIP V4
includes extensions to the three domains: symbolic constraints, update
demons and cumulative constraints. The system is available with
optional interfaces for X11 and DOS graphics (XGIP), Oracle or Ingres
database connection (QUIC), C language interface (CLIC) and embedded
application interface (EMC). CHIP V4 is written completely in C, and
is available on a range of workstations including SunSparc (SunOS
4.1), IBM RS6000 (AIX 3.2), HP 9000/700 series (HPUX 9.0) and
Decstation 3000 & 5000 (Ultrix 4.2) and PC386/486 (Dos 5.0).
Development and Runtime licences can be purchased for single-user,
multi-user or site licences together with support and maintenance. An
academic discount is offered for educational and research purposes.

CLP(RI) is a Prolog-based Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) language
whose constraint-handling applies to arithmetic on Real Intervals
(RI). It is available on the Macintosh (PowerMac and M680x0 - all
versions from 1 MB Mac Plus up). The constraint system allows users to
express both non-linear and linear equations as constraint relations.

ILOG SOLVER (formerly called PECOS) is a C++ library that implements a 
CLP (Constraint Logic Programming) instance known as finite domains.
It is available on most Unix platforms, including Sun, HP, IBM
RS-6000, DEC, and SGI, and on Windows 3.1 for both Microsoft Visual
C++ and Borland C++. This library includes:
  - Prolog control structures:  non determinism, choice points,
    backtracking and cut. Modification of user-defined objects can be
    trailed so that their state is restored when a failure occurs.
  - Finite domain logical variables, and associated constraints.
  - Finite set logical variables and associated constraints.
  - Interval floating point variables, and associated
    constraints, analogous to what is found in BNR Prolog.
  - Predefined search and optimization algorithms. 
ILOG SOLVER does not use unification for passing arguments.  This
enables a smooth integration with C++. For further information: In the
USA and Canada, contact ILOG, Inc., 2073 Landings Drive, Mountain
View, CA 94303, phone (415) 390-9000, fax (415) 390-0946, e-mail

Subject: [2-7] Free Logic Programming Systems

ALF:
   ALF (Algebraic Logic Functional programming language) is a
   language which combines functional and logic programming techniques.
   The foundation of ALF is Horn clause logic with equality which
   consists of predicates and Horn clauses for logic programming, and
   functions and equations for functional programming.  The abstract
   machine is based on the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) with several
   extensions to implement narrowing and rewriting.     In the current
   implementation programs of this abstract machine are executed by an
   emulator written in C. It is available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/programming/languages/LogicFunctional/
   (aka simpson.germany.eu.net) as the files alf_*.zoo
   (Documentation, C sources for the emulator, the preprocessor and the
   compiler). For further information, contact Rudolf Opalla
   <opalla@julien.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

CORAL:
   CORAL is a deductive database/logic programming system developed at
   the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is a declarative language
   based on Horn-clause rules with extensions like SQL's group-by and
   aggregation operators, and uses a Prolog-like syntax.

   CORAL is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/coral/.  The
   distribution includes source code compatible with AT&T C++ Version 2.0
   or later, executables for Decstations and SUN 4s, the CORAL User
   Manual, and some related papers containing a language overview and
   implementation details.  (A version of the source code compatible with
   GNU g++ will be available shortly.) For more information, contact
   Raghu Ramakrishnan, <raghu@ricotta.cs.wisc.edu>.

Lolli:
   Lolli is an interpreter for logic programming based on linear logic
   principles. Lolli, named for the linear logic implication operator
   "-o" called lollipop, is a full implementation of the language
   described in the paper "Logic Programming in a Fragment of
   Intuitionistic Linear Logic" (Josh Hodas & Dale Miller, to appear in
   Information and Computation), though it differs a bit in syntax, and
   has several built-in extra-logical predicates and operators. Lolli is
   available by anonymous ftp from 
      ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/Lolli/Lolli-07.tar.Z 
   This distribution includes full ML source, along with a Makefile, as well
   as several background papers and a collection of example programs. For
   those who do not have SML-NJ at their site, the authors hope to
   provide pre-built binaries for a variety of architectures. These
   binaries can be found on 
      ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/Lolli/binaries/
   At present Sparc and NeXT binaries are available.  If you compile
   lolli on a new architecture, please contact Josh Hodas at
   <hodas@saul.cis.upenn.edu> so that he can make your binary available.

Mercury:
   Mercury is a new, purely declarative logic programming language.
   Like Prolog and other existing logic programming languages, it is a
   very high-level language that allows programmers to concentrate on the
   problem rather than the low-level details such as memory management. 
   Unlike Prolog, which is oriented towards exploratory programming,
   Mercury is designed for the construction of large, reliable, efficient
   software systems by teams of programmers.  As a consequence,
   programming in Mercury has a different flavor than programming in
   Prolog.

   The main features of Mercury are:

	-  Mercury is purely declarative: predicates in Mercury do not
	   have non-logical side effects.
	-  Mercury is a strongly typed language.  Mercury's type system is
	   based on many-sorted logic with parametric polymorphism, very
	   similar to the type systems of modern functional languages such
	   as ML and Haskell.  Type errors are reported at compile time.
	-  Mercury is a strongly moded language.  
	-  Mercury has a strong determinism system. 
	-  Mercury has a module system.  
	-  Mercury supports higher-order programming,
	   with closures, currying, and lambda expressions.
	-  Mercury is very efficient (in comparison with existing logic
	   programming languages).  Strong types, modes, and determinism
	   provide the compiler with the information it needs to generate
	   very efficient code.

   The current Mercury system runs on Unix machines. It is known to run on
   Solaris 2.x, IRIX 5.x, Ultrix 4.3, OSF/1.1, BSDI 1.1, and Linux. It
   should run without too many changes on other Unix variants as well.
   You need gcc version 2.6.3 or higher and GNU make version 3.69
   or higher.  The Mercury distribution is available via anonymous
   ftp or WWW from the following locations:

	   Australia:      ftp://turiel.cs.mu.oz.au/pub/mercury
			   http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/mercury
	   USA:            ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/XSB/mercury
	   Europe:         ftp://ftp.csd.uu.se/pub/Mercury

None so far. This is to be expected, as most logic programming systems
are experimental.

Subject: [2-9] Other Commercial Prolog Products

ClauseDB is a database manager for Prolog data.  Advanced
knowledge-based applications often need to use a large number of
highly complex data objects. The objects are so complex that they
cannot be managed in a standard commercial RDB product, and the number
of them makes it impractical to store them in the standard Prolog
in-memory database. ClauseDB may also be useful even in Prolog
applications whose data can be handled in a RDB. The retrieval
procedure of ClauseDB is integrated in the Prolog search method. This
avoids the performance problems that arise with the standard scheme
for coupling Prolog with a RDBM (e.g., those caused by the well-known
mismatch problem between tuple- and set-based retrieval methods).
ClauseDB supports all the normal Prolog data objects (arbitrary terms
and clauses) and provides a locking mechanism that allows the sharing
of data while ensuring its integrity. ClauseDB 2.0 is available on
SUN SPARC (SunOS 4.x and 5.x) and the INTEL PC running Solaris 2.x.

Subject: [2-10] Prolog extensions, meta-interpreters, and pre-processors

ProFIT (Prolog with Features Inheritance and Templates) is an extension
of Prolog with sorted feature structures (including multi-dimensional
inheritance), finite domains, feature search, cyclic terms, and
templates. ProFIT works as a pre-processor, which takes a file
containing a ProFIT program as input, and gives a file with a Prolog
program as output. Sorted feature terms and finite domains are
compiled into a Prolog term representation, and the usual Prolog term
unification is used at runtime, so that there is no slowdown through a
unification algorithm, and no meta-interpreter is needed. ProFIT uses
the same techniques for compiling sorted feature terms and finite
domains into Prolog terms as the Core Langauge Engine of SRI Cambridge
and the Advanced Linguistic Engineering Platform (ALEP 2.2) by the
European Community, BIM, and Cray Systems. ProFIT is not a grammar
formalism (although it is motivated by NLP), although it provides some
ingredients that are considered typical of grammar formalisms. The goal
of ProFIT is to provide these datatypes without enforcing any
particular theory of grammar, parsing or generation. ProFIT can be used
to extend your favourite Prolog-based grammar formalism, parser and
generator with the expressive power of sorted feature terms. Cyclic
terms can be printed out and a user-configurable pretty-printer for
feature terms is provided. ProFIT is available free of charge by
anonymous ftp from
   coli.uni-sb.de:/pub/profit/
and is implemented in Sicstus Prolog (2.1 #9). For more information,
write to Gregor Erbach, Univ. Saarlandes, Saarbruecken, Germany
