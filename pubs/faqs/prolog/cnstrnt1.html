The Journal of Functional and Logic Programming (JFLP) is a new
electronic journal that covers a broad scope of topics from functional
and logic programming. It is specially concerned with the integration
of the functional and logic paradigm as well as their common
foundations. The Journal expects articles ranging from the theoretical
foundations of functional and logic programming up to the application
of such languages ``in the real world''. The Journal is published by
The MIT Press. See either of the following URL's for more details
http://mitpress.mit.edu/jrnls-catalog/jflp.html
http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~chak/jflp/

Phase Transitions in Constraint Satisfaction Problems
-----------------------------------------------------

The search difficulty of constraint satisfaction problems can be
determined, on average, from knowledge of easily computed structural
properties of the problems. In fact, hard problem instances are
concentrated near an abrupt transition between under- and over-
constrained problems. This transition is analogous to phase transitions
in physical systems and offers a way to estimate the likely difficulty
of a constraint problem before attempting to solve it with search.

Subject: [1-10] Constraints for Natural Language Processing

[This entry reprinted by kind permission of the author: Philippe
Blache <pb@llaor.unice.fr>, University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis]

Current linguistics theories often describe syntactic relations as
constraints on linguistic structures. It is in particular the case of
unification-based theories. But linguistic constraints are generally
far from the CLP ones and the question remains: is NLP a constraint
satisfaction problem ? [[MBJ adds an editorial note: Micha Meier
<micha@ecrc.de> feels that NLP _is_ a typical CSP.]]

It is still difficult to say what could be the actual advantages of a
CLP approach for natural language processing in general. But if we
don't have a global answer, several works propose CLP representation of
particular problems such as linear precedence (cf Patrick Saint-
Dizier), disjunctive values (cf Franz Guenthner), subcategorization,
etc ... I'm currently working on the interpretation of HPSG's
principles with boolean constraints. The problem in this case comes
from the fact that the instantiation principles of this theory can be
seen as constraints on feature structures, but using actual active
constraints need a very rigid (and heavy) representation of these
structures. A compromise between a pure CLP and a pure linguistic
approach is still inevitable.

I would be deeply interested in other approaches to this problem.

Subject: [1-11] N-Ary CSPs (N > 2)

[This entry reprinted by kind permission of the author: Sunil
Mohan <mohan@yoko.rutgers.edu>, Rutgers University]

N-ary CSPs have constraints with arbitrary arity, including some with
arity > 2. There are some problems with solving CSPs that appear only
when encountering constraints with higher arities. Constraints with
maximum arity are also called global constraints.

Selecting a suitable Variable-Constraint Ordering (Control Sequence)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the popular variable ordering heuristics for generating a
"good" control sequence fail on N-ary CSPs:

- Ordering based on variable domain size. Many such heuristics fail
because of their very localized view of the problem. Consider the CSP:
	{<x1..x5> | T1(x1 x2) T2(x1 x2 x3) T3(x4 x5)}
After first selecting (x1 x2 T1), a variable-domain-size based
heuristic could proceed to pick x4 as the next variable to bind, when
x3 could have been a better choice because it allows T3 to be tested.
Or, in Forward-Check, (x1 T1 x2 T3..) is probably a better choice than
(x1 T1 x4 T5 x2 T3..), but this heuristic does not have a way of
recognizing the presence of higher-arity constraints.

This is not a problem with Binary CSPs, particularly in FwdChk, because
after binding each variable, a binary constraint on that variable can
be tested.

- Ordering based on variable connectivity. In a CSP with a global
constraint, every variable is connected to n-1 other variables. The
same happens with heuristics based on minimizing Constraint Bandwidth
[Ramin Zabih, 8th NCAI 1990].


Some Ordering Heuristics for N-ary CSPs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have experimented with the following ordering heuristics:
 - Minimizing Constraint Bandwidth Sum
 - Minimizing Constraint Depth Sum
	(Constr Depth is distance of constr from beginning of sequence)
 - Ordering variables based on nbr of constraints on it.

In general, to generate a good control sequence for N-ary CSPs, a
global view of the problem is needed. Binding a variable that allows a
(n-ary) constraint that already has the rest of its argument variables
bound, should get higher priority than another variable, all other
things being equal. Sometimes it is better to view the problem as one
of ordering constraints rather than variables.

I like to think of testing constraints as early as possible in the
search tree. Hence the Constraint BandWidth Sum and Depth Sum
heuristics. Of course, variable domain size is also a factor.

Decomposing the CSP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Freuder [JACM, Jan 1981] showed that tree-shaped CSPs can be solved
(find first solution) without backtracking after some consistency
processing. Consequently some techniques have been developed to get
non-tree problems into that form. Some techniques decompose a CSP into
variable clusters such that the shape of the constraint network on
these clusters is tree shaped [Dechter & Pearl, AIJ 1989; Gyssens,
Jeavons, Cohen, 1992; etc.]. Each variable cluster includes some
cluster-local constraints. The complexity of the problem is reduced to
the complexity of the largest cluster. With a global constraint in the
CSP, this kind of decomposition is not possible. Cycle-cutset based
techniques stumble in the same way.

Subject: [1-13] Constraints and Rule-Based (Production) Systems

Milind Tambe <tambe@isi.edu> writes: Many researchers have explored
the possible integration of constraint satisfaction techniques/methods
and production (rule-based) systems. The integration has been explored
in the context of both backward chaining[1] and forward-chaining
systems (see below).

This short note focuses on one aspect of this integration: constraints
and forward-chaining production systems. These forward chaining systems
execute tasks by going through recognize-act cycles: in the recognize
or match phase, productions or rules match with working memory (a
database of facts) and in the act phase, the matched productions are
fired, causing changes to working memory, in turn causing the system to
execute the next recognize act cycle. Integration of constraints with
such systems is possible at multiple levels. At a higher level, the
integration with constraints may involve a shift in the recognize-act
cycle. For instance, constraint-satisfaction techniques may be used in
addition to the recognize-act cycle to define values in working
memory[2]. At this higher level, constraints do not change the
recognize-act cycle itself. At a lower level, however, the integration
with constraints may involve a change in the recognition procedure,
i.e., the procedure used to match productions with working memory. More
specifically, the problem of matching conditions of productions with
working memory can be mapped over onto constraint satisfaction
problems. Techniques such as arc-consistency, path-consistency or
others may then be used either to reduce the match cost of productions
by quickly eliminating easily detectably inconsistencies, or
alternatively even to substitute for the matching procedure[3].

Subject: [1-15] Dynamic CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)

Thomas Schiex <schiex@saturne.cert.fr> writes: A definition: A dynamic
constraint satisfaction problem P is a sequence P_0 ... P_alpha of
static CSPs each one resulting from a change in the preceding one [1].
This change may be a _restriction_ (a new constraint is imposed on a
subset of variables) or a _relaxation_ (a constraint is removed from
the CSP).

Subject: [1-17] Explanation of value ordering heuristics

> when doing value ordering or is it domain dependent?

In Constraint Satisfaction Problems, once you have decided which
_variable_ to instantiate next, say V, if V has more than one possible
value, you might ask which _value_ to choose first.

The simplest is to go systematically through the domain of V from
smallest to largest. But if V has domain [1,2,...10] and (by some
magic) you know that some/all the solutions to your CSP have V=10, then
it would be nice if you could try V=10 first, before wasting a lot of
work on 1,2,...

One well-known heuristic is to choose that value for V which is
consistent with the _greatest_ number of the constraints on V. If V is
only involved in constraints with X, and the possible values for (V,X)
are (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), then you should choose V=1 before trying V=2.

Unfortunately, it is quite expensive to keep on checking which is the
most popular value in this sense. (And there is no point doing it if
you want all solutions, as you will have to try V=1 and V=2 anyway.) It
is so expensive that it is usually not worth doing.

Of course, if you have problem-specific knowledge it might suggest a
different heuristic, which might be good in your particular circumstances.

In contrast, the first-fail heuristic for choosing which _variable_ to
instantiate next by choosing the one with smallest domain size, is (a)
very cheap (b) often gives good benefits.

Subject: [1-18] Explanation of constraint entailment

> Could anybody give me the definition of constraint entailment?

If we already have `X = 8' in the constraint store, we can ask three
questions about some other constraint C:

a) Is C entailed by the store?
	If C is, say, `X > 5' then the answer is `yes' -- X > 5 does
	not give you any extra information if you already know that
	X = 8.
b) Is the negation of C entailed by the store? (Is C `disentailed')
	If C is `X > 5' the answer is `no', but if C was, say, X < 2,
	it would be false in the context provided by the store
c) Is C neither entailed nor disentailed?
	The constraint `Y = 4' is consistent with the store, and so is
	its negation, but it is not entailed by it.

In the language of Concurrent Constraints, we can `ask' if a constraint
is entailed, and get `yes', `no' or `suspend' (i.e. the ask goes to
sleep until enough extra information is added to the store to give a
definite answer). If we want to add information to the store, we can do
a `tell' which only works if the constraint to be told is not
inconsistent with the store.

Subject: [1-19] Explanation of Don't Know / Don't Care nondeterminism

> Could anybody give me the definitions of committed choice, don't
> know, and don't care nondeterminism, please?

Don't know/don't care nondeterminism:
If I say to a class of students ``Write all your names on this piece of
paper'' then I know that I want ALL the names, but I don't KNOW which
ORDER they will be written in.

If I say to a class of students ``One of you must clean the board
before the lesson'' then I only want ONE of them to do it, and I don't
CARE who.

Or, in an operating system, when I save a file in the editor, I don't
care which particular block of the disk the file is written on. But
once the OS has started writing the file to one block, I don't want it
to change its mind half-way through -- I want it to COMMIT to the
CHOICE it has made.

So don't know nondeterminism is what you get from Prolog's search rule
whereas don't care nondeterminism (sometimes called `indeterminism') is
what you would expect from an OS, or from ``Committed choice parallel
logic languages'' such as Parlog or FGHC. Committed choice is linked to
the idea of a `guard' or `commit' operator which is like the `cut' in
Prolog (but imagine having to have a cut at the begining of every
clause, so once you have selected it, you are committed to it and there
is no back-tracking).

Committed-choice and don't care --> you lose the link between
declarative (model-theoretic) and operational semantics which is one of
the nice things about Prolog.

Cooperative Constraint Solvers
------------------------------
Michel Rueher <rueher@essi.fr>

For solving constraints over the reals, we have defined a cooperating
architecture based on an asynchronous communication between
heterogeneous solvers. It enables to put together both symbolic and
numerical solvers for tackling systems of constraints that none of them
could solve alone. Solutions provided by such a cooperating system are
always at least as accurate than the one which could individually be
computed by the different solvers. A prototype for a cooperative system
including a solver of linear equations and inequalities, a solver of
polynomial equalities, and a solver based on interval propagation is
under development.

Symbolic Representation Scheme
------------------------------
Leon Sterling <leon@ces.cwru.edu>

This paper describes experience in using constraint logic programming
to reason about mechanical parts. A prototype program was written in
the language CLP(R) which verified whether a part met specific
tolerances in its dimensions. The program is interesting in that the
same code can be used with any mixture of symbolic and numeric values.
A symbolic representation scheme, underlying the program, which allows
both symbolic and numeric values, is described. Examples are given of
defining generic parts and toleranced parts, and checking whether a
part meets its tolerances. Finally, a design rule checker is sketched
to show how the logical representation of logic representation
languages facilitates higher level reasoning.

|> Question: Could somebody explain the following terms:
|>  - Global constraints

The term "global constraint" is related with the level of consistency
achieved by the propagation engine. A classical example is the "alldiff"
constraint:
  alldiff(x1,...xi,...xn)
setting that, in any solution, all the values of the xi must be
pairwise distinct.

The traditionnal (local) handling of this constraint ensures that, each
time a variable is instantiated to a value, this value does not appear
in the domains of the other variables.
More formally, the following holds:
  forall xi, forall xj != xi, forall u belonging to the domain of xi,
  there exists a value v in the domain of xj such that u != v.
The global handling of this constraint should maintain the following
property:
  forall xi, forall u in the domain of xi, there exist values from
  domains of {x1,...,xj,...xn | xj != xi} such that u and these values
  are pairwise distinct.
In other words, the global consistency of a constraint is: any value in
the domain of a variable belongs to a solution.
The global consistency of the alldiff constraint has been shown by J-C
Regin in: "A filtering algorithm for constraint of difference in CSPs.
Jean-Charles Regin, AAAI 94, Seattle, Washington".

The paper "Beyond the Glass Box: Constraints as Objects. Jean-Francois
Puget, Michel Leconte, ILPS'95", discusses what kind of constructs are
needed to implement global constraints. Experimental results are also
given, demonstrating significant speedups vs local propagation
implementations.

|>  - Specific and structural constraints 
|>  (in: CHIC lessons on CLP methodology, ECRC-report)

The CHIC project (Constraint Handling in Industry and Commerce, Esprit
project number 5291) was finished at the end of 1994. One of its result
concerns the CLP methodology, with a big emphasis on the qualification
phase: given a (instance of a) problem, (try to) predict if:
  - it is feasible,
  - it needs the coding of new constraints (e.g. the cooperation
    of OR [operations research] algorithms and propagations).

One of the first phases of the methodology is to differentiate specific
and structural constraints:

Structural constraints deals with global properties of the problem and
act on variables playing similar roles (the sub-problem is homogeneous).
For example, you can easily encode a flow transportation problem in a
CLP using elementary arithmetic constraint. Netherless, there is a more
global structure (a graph) that represents the problem together with a
_structural_ constraint (flow conservation) to express it.

At the opposite, specific constraints depends on the instance of the 
application.

The term 'global constraints' has been used in CHIP to actually denote
constraints that subsume a set of other constraints. It does not
necessarily mean that complete global consistency is being achieved,
but just the fact that more consistency is being achieved than by
considering each constraint in this set separately. This concerns
mainly finite domain constraints where global consistency is hard to
obtain. The term 'global constraints' is quite misleading, and it
should be replaced by something more appropriate like e.g. 'composite
constraints'.  Note that you can have several global constraints with
the same declarative reading, but with different algoritm being used
and thus different levels of consistency being achieved.

F.Novak, I.Mozetic, M.Santo-Zarnik, A.Biasizzo. 
Enhancing design-for-test for active analog filters using CLP(R). 
Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications, Kluwer Ac. Publ.
Vol.4, No. 4, 1993, pp.315-329.

We describe a computer-aided approach to automatic fault isolation in
active analog filters which enhances the design-for-test (DFT)
methodology proposed by Soma (1990). His primary concern was in
increased controllability and observability while the fault isolation
procedure was sketched only in general terms. We operationalize and
extend the DFT methodology by using CLP(R) to model analog circuits and
by a model-based diagnosis approach to implement a diagnostic
algorithm. CLP(R) is a logic programming language which combines
symbolic and numeric computation. The diagnostic algorithm uses
different DFT test modes and results of voltage measurements for
different frequencies and computes a set of suspected components.
Ranking of suspected components is based on a measure of (normalized)
standard deviations from predicted mean values of component parameters.
The diagnosis is performed incrementally, in each step reducing the set
of potential candidates for the detected fault. Presented case studies
show encouraging results in isolation of soft faults of a given low
pass biquad filter.

Subject: [1-24] Constraint Abstraction

by Chris Beck (chris@{cs,ie}.utoronto.ca)

Given CSP C to solve, we would like to know how to transform it
into CSP C' such that:
	1) C' is more easily solved than C.
	2) Solving C' provides knowledge that makes the subsequent
	   search for a solution to C easier.
	3) The transformation from C to C' can be efficiently
	   achieved.

The transformation of C to C' is the "abstraction" of C to the
"higher-level" C'.

Berthe Y. Choueiry (choueiry@liasun1.epfl.ch) notes:
