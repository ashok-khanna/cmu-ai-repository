I should have posted this before the FAQ posts, but anyway...

A lot of changes have occurred to the new comp.robotics FAQ posting.

Content:
- There are over 250  content changes since the last
  posting. I.e. addresses, names, numbers, reviews, updates etc. With
  all these changes I didn't make an individual change list.

Format:
- It is now in five parts and, in total, is over 500K.

- Section formats have been changed drastically and improved.

- A more standard numbering and labeling scheme has been emplaced.

- In several cases the ordering has also been changed to reflect growing
  content and, I hope, a better sequence of sections.

- URL formats are standard throughout.

I hope all this is a big step in increasing the usability of the FAQ
and this will also assist in forming the primary HTML form
the FAQ will take. In the future, the text versions will be generated
from the HTML versions and not the other way around.

Here's the new table of contents:
