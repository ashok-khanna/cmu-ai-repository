Well, in the following post is the first edition of the Robotics List of
Sources. A few weeks ago I requested people to e-mail me with their input
so that I/we could make this thing, but only a few people responded. I
would like to thank them personally: 

David Gaw, Keith McClary, and Tim McDonough 

That's it! That's all the people who responded. I NEED MORE MORE MORE! 

Please, please send any additions/suggestions/revisions to me so that I may
add them to the list. There are a few things to notw, however. I will not
change the format of the sources; I think it is easy to use as it
is--however, I am open to suggestions on the index. Note #2: I make no
comments about the credibility of accuracy of this list. If you have any
information about the companies listed feel free to send me comments
(corrected phone numbers, bad reports, etc...) 

Once again, I repeat myself: SEND ME MORE SOURCES! This list could be a
powerful and useful document to the net, but only with your support. Cya.

Note:  normally, the index would be located at the beginning of the list to
help people looking for sensors, or kits, etc.  It's kind of like a table
of contents, but its been deleted so I'll have to make a new one.  The
current index topics are Electronics, Motors, Complete Systems or Kits, and
Miscellaneous.  If you have any other suggestions, let me know.  Cya.

competetion where corporations and HS Students form partnerships to build
competing robots like Dr Flowers' ME class at MIT. (The MIT class has been
shown on Scientific American Frontiers). This one supplier is intended to
handle most of the misc parts needed to build a robot if it is not included
in supplied "kit". They have drive components, lots of materials, tubing,
