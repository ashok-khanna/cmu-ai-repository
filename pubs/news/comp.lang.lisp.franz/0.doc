Summary:      Archives for the comp.lang.lisp.franz newsgroup

Version:      23-JUL-94 to present

Description:

   This directory contains archives for the comp.lang.lisp.franz
   newsgroup.  The new articles are archived once a week, in a gzipped
   tar file of the form YY_MM_DD.tgz, where YY, MM, and DD are replaced
   with the year, month, and day, respectively. Most archiving began with
   94_09_14.tgz, which includes articles since 23-JUL-94.3

   Note that comp.lang.lisp.franz is for discussion of Franz Lisp, a
   dialect of Lisp. This newsgroup is not for discussion of Allegro
   Common Lisp from Franz Inc, but some discussion does tend to creep
   in here due to name confusion. Allegro CL should be discussed in
   comp.lang.lisp, or in the allegro-cl@cs.berkeley.edu mailing list.
