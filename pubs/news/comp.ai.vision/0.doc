Summary:      Archives for the comp.ai.vision newsgroup

Version:      March 1988 to present

Description:

   This directory contains archives for the comp.ai.vision newsgroup.  The new
   articles are archived once a week, in a gzipped tar file of the form
   YY_MM_DD.tgz, where YY, MM, and DD are replaced with the year, month,
   and day, respectively. Local archiving began with 94_09_14.tgz, which
   includes articles since 23-JUL-94. Archives from March 1988 through
   the end of August 1994 (in the files YYdigest.tgz, where YY is the year)
   were obtained from the Vision List archive, which provides
   comp.ai.vision in digest format.
