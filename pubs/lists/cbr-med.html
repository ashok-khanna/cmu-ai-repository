			      CBR-MED

A physician diagnosing the illness of a new patient is reminded of a
past patient and checks to see if the former diagnosis is relevant. A
dosimetrist who is designing a radiotherapy plan for a cancer patient
refers to a therapy atlas of past patients for plan suggestions. These
are examples of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a form of problem solving
in which the problem solver reuses a past case to solve a new problem.
CBR is both a model of human cognition and a paradigm for computer-
based problem solvers.

The CBR-MED mailing list provides a forum for the discussion of CBR
methods in Medicine. The list brings together medical practitioners,
health informaticians, and CBR researchers in service of two goals:

1) To support the delivery of medical care by fostering the
development of CBR software that performs health care related tasks.

2) To spur the development of CBR methods by focusing the efforts of
researchers on the challenges (large databases, knowledge
representation problems, etc.) provided by medical and health
informatics problems.
