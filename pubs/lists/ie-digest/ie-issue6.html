        avialable as SFI tech reports -- send mail to Andi Sutherland

        reports electronically, and then you can order
        the ones that look relevant.

        Erhard Bruderer - School of Business Adminstration -
        University of Michigan (email: Erhard.Bruderer@um.cc.umich.edu) has
        done work in economics with GAs and classifier systems: e.g.

ICGA-93 Announcement

The Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms

Tob held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign


The Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (ICGA-93), will be
held on July 17-21, 1993 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
 This meeting brings together an international community from academia,
government, and industry interested in algorithms suggested by the
evolutionary process of natural selection.  Topics of particular interest
include: genetic algorithms and classifier systems, evolution strategies,
and other forms of evolutionary computation; machine learning and
optimization using these methods, their relations to other learning
paradigms (e.g., neural networks and simulated annealing), and mathematical
descriptions of their behavior.

The meeting will include pre-conference tutorials, invited speakers, and
workshops.

A full description of the conference together with details of registration
and travel may be found in the IE ftp archive as `icga-93'.

Evolutionary Models in Economics and the Social Sciences


My working bibliography on this topic is now available by email. It is NOT a
highly polished or anywhere near complete bibliography, though I am in the
process of refining it into sections and providing one line explanations for
why things are on it. It has also absorbed one or two other postings without
acknowledgements, though these will be forthcoming shortly. It may be of
interest to anyone studying CULTURAL EVOLUTION, EVOLUTIONARY MODELS, SOCIAL
DARWINISM (?), GENETIC ALGORITHMS, ALIFE (?), ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS (?), BEHAVIOURAL
THEORY OF THE FIRM, POLITICAL SCIENCE and AI APPLICATIONS generally. My 
interest is in AI techniques and evolutionary applications that actually 
investigate the process of economic action so I am leaving out EXPERT SYSTEMS 
and NEURAL NET PREDICTION which often attempt to predict and prescribe without
explaining, though obviously there are exceptions. (I have tried to provide a
few pointers to this literature however.)

Obviously I will be extremely happy to receive information on further work, to
correspond with interested parties and maybe to provide hints on how to get
hold of some of the stuff, though I shall also be adding contact addresses to
the bibliography in the course of time. I am planning to set up an 
"unofficial" mailing list of interested parties. If there are enough I will try
to get ftp access set up.

Many thanks to those who responded to my original request so long ago!

PS If any individuals that I forwarded this to are unhappy about it, my
apologies and please let me know. I was just working from the list of people I
corresponded with who I though wouldn't mind. (Similarly if you are getting
multiple posts, please let me know which address you would prefer me to use!)

PPS Please forward this to anyone you think may not see it and want to. I would
also be happy to hear about any suitable digests or mailinglists who may be
interested.

Scope
 -----
AIEM3 will address issues relevant to the use of AI technology in
economics and management communities. The Workshop consists of
research papers and application case sessions. Topics will cover both
technology and applications.  The technologies of interest include,
but are not limited to: knowledge representation and acquisition
(knowledge-based decision support systems, expert systems), problem-
solving paradigm (qualitative reasoning, fuzzy logic, neural
networks), and human-machine interface (natural language, machine
learning, hypertext, multimedia). AI applications in accounting,
banking, economics, finance, manufacturing, and management are the
focus of the Workshop.

Background
 ----------
This Workshop is regularly sponsored by IFAC, IFORS, IFIP, IEEE, and
ACM. The first workshop was held March 12-14, 1985 in Zurich,
Switzerland, and attended by more than 140 persons. Four years later,
the second workshop was held in Singapore, January 9-13, 1989. It was
attended by more than 230 persons, with a geographical coverage
extending to all of Asia, North America, Europe, Australia, Middle-
East and South America. Two books entitled Artificial Intelligence in
Economics and Management, and Expert Systems in Economics, Banking and
Management were published by North-Holland as a result of these
conferences.  These publications serve as the earliest references on
the development of applying AI in economics and management.
Proceedings of the 1993 workshop will also be published.

Language
 --------
Throughout the Workshop, English will be the official language.  All
papers and presentations are in English. Translation facilities will
not be available.

Registration
 ------------
The registration fee is US$200 if paid in full before July 15,1993. A
limited number of spaces are available for full-time students at
US$75. Registration after July 15, 1993 including on-site registration
must add a late fee of US$50. Benefits of registration include
attendance to the Workshop, a copy of the abstracts, and a cocktail
reception.

Conference site registration is in the Portland State University
School of Business Administration on August 25, 1993 between 8am -
12pm. Participants staying at the Marriott Hotel can also be
registered there. Advance registration is recommended by completing
the registration form attached.

The registration fee is required by all participants, including

About Portland, the City of Roses
 ---------------------------------
Portland is located within 90 minutes driving time of snow-covered
Mt. Hood to the east, and the famed Oregon coastline to the west.  With
its excellent parks, cultural facilities, transportation system, and
great cityscape, Portland is one of the most beautiful cities in
America.  As Oregon's economic and population center and gateway to
the Pacific Rim, Portland offers unique opportunities for business and
industry, and the government and university to enhance partnerships
that promote economic, social, cultural, and international
development.

About Portland State University
 -------------------------------
Portland State University is the only comprehensive public higher
education institution in the greater Portland area.  Total enrollment
in 1992-93 exceeded 14,000, including more than 3,500 graduate
students.  The university's mission is to provide excellent programs
in teaching, research, and public service in Oregon's major
metropolitan area.

Conference Hotel
 ----------------
A block of rooms is reserved for Workshop participants at the Portland
Marriott Hotel from August 24 to August 27, 1993. The rate is US$85
for single and double occupancy, exclusive of service charge and local
tax. Hotel accommodation will be guaranteed if the registration form

nights before or after the conference may be arranged with the hotel
after arrival.

The conference site at the Portland State University School of
Business Administration is within walking distance from the Marriott
Hotel.

Travel & Tours
 --------------
All travel arrangements must be made by participants. Tours to local
places of interest can be arranged with the local travel agent through
