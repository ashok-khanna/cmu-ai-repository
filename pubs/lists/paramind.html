Announcement of a mailing list that may be of interest:
   
	List Name:  Paramind@eskimo.com
	This is a mailling list for discussing concepts of
computer-generated writing especially those related to the theory of the
"telical exhaustion of the interaction of words."  Telical means, "towards
an useful end."  The Paramind Brainstorming program, which was created
with this theory in mind, will be discussed in detail. 
	Appropriate Topics include: 
	*  Speculating on the theory of "telical word-interaction
exhaustion." 
	*  Use of this theory for important research and aesthetics. 
	*  How we can come up with useful and unique statements by computer
means. 
	*  Examples of uses of the Paramind program, such as merges and new
word categories. 
	NO long postings from universities, companies or individuals
regarding AI conferences will be accepted.  No postings of subject matter
not directly related to producing text-output by computer means. 
	This list is not moderated so all messages sent to the list are
immediately forwarded to the list.  Depending on the traffic of the list,
it may be edited in digest form for the convenience of the participants. 
	To join or be removed from the Paramind mailing list, send a
message to Paramind-request@eskimo.com. 
	There is also a FAQ for this list.  It is being kept at eskimo.com
in /usr/ftp/paramind as paramind.faq and is available via anonymous FTP. 
	List Coordinator:   telical@eskimo.com
 
 
   More information can be received by sending a request to the list
coordinator. You don't have to be put on the mailing list to receive it,
but indicate this when requesting.
