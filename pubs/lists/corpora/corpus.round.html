				Call for Papers
	Georgetown University Round Table On Languages and Linguistics (GURT)
			Pre-Session: CORPUS-BASED LINGUISTICS

			     Wednesday March 10, 1993

The analysis of large text corpora is engaging the interest of linguists from
many subfields, as the field turns away from linguistic analysis based on
introspection to data-oriented approaches. Currently, insights are not fully
shared, as the subfields and related disciplines often present research at
different conferences. For this full-day GURT pre-session, 20-minute 
papers are solicited on the following topics:

	- the design and collection of text/speech corpora
	- tools for searching and processing on-line corpora
	- critical assessments of on-line corpora and corpus-processing tools
	- methodological issues in corpus-based analysis
	- applications and results in linguistics and related 
	disciplines, including language teaching, computational linguistics, 
	historical linguistics, discourse analysis, and stylistic analysis

Send 1 page (500-word) abstracts to cball@guvax.georgetown.edu (Internet), 
cball@guvax (Bitnet), or Catherine N. Ball, Dept. of Linguistics, 
Georgetown University, Washington DC 20057. Electronic submissions are 
encouraged. Please include name, institution, address, telephone number, and 
e-mail address.
Deadline for receipt of abstracts is Dec. 1, 1992.
