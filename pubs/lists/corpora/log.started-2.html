Subject: Adm. message

For a while, I have been holding and inspecting messages to the
Corpora list, to filter out requests for addition/deletion etc.

The situation now seems reasonable stable so I go back to the
automatic redistribution.

You have seen several addresses starting like corp..@..hd.uib.no.
Please use only one of these (preferably corpora@nora.hd.uib.no or
corpora@x400.hd.uib.no) and do not CC: to the other addresses).

I have also changed distribution system from a X400 mailer to a
Unix mailer, due to problems with some addresses with _ (underscore).

I am sorry that in this process, some of you got a couple of error
messages that was not supposed to go to the list.

Old messages can be read by connection with Gopher to nora.hd.uib.no
or by using FTP or our mail based server fileserv@hd.uib.no as described
in the welcoming message.

If you have not got the welcoming message, you can request this by sending
the line:

send corpora corpora.list.welcome

to: fileserv@hd.uib.no

You ask:

I was wondering whether there are people reading this list
who are working on (or have references to) taggers for languages
other than English. I am especially interested in German,  French
and Spanish.

Iassume you have heard of the CHILDES project at Carnegie Mellon university.
If not, then you might be interested in contacting them. The have amongst
other things, a corpus of child language texts, coded according to the
CHILDES system (Child Language Data Exchange System). There is also program-
ware available for both Mac and IBM-DOS for working with corpuses tagged
using this system.

The coordinator of the project is Jeff McWhinney, and the e-mail address for
info. is: childes@andrew.cmu.edu. It is possible to ftp stuff from the
CHILDES corpus from poppy.psy.cmu.edu (ip 128.2.298.42)

what sort of tags are we talking about?

i was looking for programs which would accept text as input and
produce text+part of speech tags as output.  i didn't think that the
childes project had anything of that sort at all.

The CHILDES project has a part of speech tagger for English, a similar
system for German is under development. These taggers require the data
to be formatted according to the CHILDES transcript conventions.

      i was looking for programs which would accept text as input and
      produce text+part of speech tags as output. 

In my original query I indeed used tagging in the linguistic sense of adding 
grammatical (and lexeme) information (in a broad sense) to a _word_, as 
opposed to reconstructing  (marking) the _phrasal_ structure of text (for 
which tags are used in mark up languages).

For those interested in Dutch,  I have a stochastic tagger for Dutch,  based
on a trigram model discussed in Church [1988] and trained using the "Eindhoven"
tagged corpus of Dutch.   It assigns syntactic category (aka part of speech) 
labels to words,  and has some extra facilities for e.g. unknown words.  I
developed the tagger to use it in combination with an existing alignment program
and extract information from parallel (aligned) bilingual texts. However, there
don't exist many Dutch-English bilingual corpora, that I know of.

Sounds like CHILDES is not known to everybody in this list, so
I'll give a short introduction here:


CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) comprises 

(a) a set of transcript conventions tailored for child language
(b) a large collection of computerized language acquisition data, 
    most of the data formated according to (a)
(c) a set of computer programs for analyzing (b)   

(b) and (c) are available on CD-ROM from CMU (write to
CHILDES@andrew.cmu.edu or to Brian MacWhinney (brian@andrew.cmu.edu)
for a copy) and through anonymous ftp (poppy.psy.cmu.edu). Although
CHILDES yields free access for research purposes, one is officially
required to become a 'CHILDES-member' before using the data (by
sending an informal note to Brian MacWhinney).

There are also some European centers of CHILDES, one of which is
located at the Max-Planck for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. 

Transcript conventions, software and data collection are thoroughly
described in: Brian MacWhinney:  The CHILDES Project: Tools for
Analyzing Talk. Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaums, 1991.  The ISBN for the
paperback is 51-0-8058-1006-4 and the price is $29.95.

Not described in that manual are recent software developments. One of
the developments is a morphological tagger based on the ECAT parser of
Roland Hauser. It takes utterances transcribed according to (a) as
input and attaches a so-called mor-tier with full morphological
analysis to it. The basic engine of the parser is language
independent. Language-specific information is stored in separate files.
CHILDES currently supplies such files for English.  It is said that
German versions are in preparation. Ambiguous forms are 'handled' in
two ways: the interactive version of the parser generates a menu of
choices and asks the user to select one of it, the non-interactive
version writes all possible alternatives to the output and marks the
forms as ambiguous.

Brian MacWhinney should be able to provide more information on this. 
A preliminary version of the user manual for the newer programs is
available via ftp as a packed MS-Word file for the Mac at
poppy.psy.cmu.edu (128.2.248.4), directory clan/macintosh, file
update.sit.hqx.

Could you possibly point me to some information on the CHILDES

No, you're quite right. CHILDES involves a lot of work coding (or tagging?)
the texts. I wasn't in fact aware that there were programs available for
doing this kind of thing automatically. They must be very "intelligent" in
that case. It will be interesting to hear form any others on this topic.

(The reason I mentioned CHILDES was because they have a considerable
corpus of coded texts in different languages available)

humanities, the development of significant new networked-based and
computer-based resources for humanities research, and the
application and evaluation of computing techniques in humanities
subjects.
 
TOPICS: We welcome submissions on topics such as text encoding;
statistical methods for text analysis; hypertext; text corpora;
computational lexicography; morphological, syntactic, semantic and
other forms of text analysis; also, computer applications in history,
philosophy, music and other humanities disciplines. For the 1993
conference, ACH and ALLC extend a special invitation to members of the
library community to contribute to the conference on the topics of
creating and cataloguing network-based resources in the humanities,
developing and integrating databases of texts and images of works
central to the humanities, and refining retrieval techniques for
humanities databases.

River, is a six-mile ride by taxi from Washington National Airport. 
International flights arrive at Dulles Airport, which offers regular 
bus service to the Nation's Capital.
 
REQUIREMENTS: Proposals should describe substantial and original
work. Proposals describing the development of new computing
methodologies should make clear how these methodologies are applied
to research and/or teaching in the humanities. Those concerned with a
particular application (e.g., a study of the style of an author)
should cite previous approaches to the problem and should include some
critical assessment of the computing methodologies used. All proposals
should include references to important sources.
 
ABSTRACT LENGTH: Abstracts of 1500-2000 words in length should be
submitted for presentations of thirty minutes including questions.

                       December 3 & 4 1992
                    Sulzbach (Taunus) Germany


This is an announcement for the upcoming fourth workshop in a series of
workshops on implementing the Unicode Standard and sponsored by the
Unicode Consortium.  This is the first time the workshop is being
offered in Europe.  Should you not be able to attend yourself, please
pass this notice on to somebody else who might be interested in
attending this workshop.

Unicode:
   Unicode is an international character encoding standard that
   encompasses all the world's national scripts in a 16bit code space.
   Unicode is a profile of the International Standard ISO 10646.
   Supported by most major computer and software vendors, Unicode greatly
   facilitates the development of internationally accepted software.  All
   currently used character sets can be transferred to Unicode.

Target Audience:
   Software developers, technical writers, managers or engineers
   developing or considering development of software for the international
   market.

Date and Time:
   December 3 and 4, 1992, 9am - 5pm

Location:
   The workshop will be held at the Holiday Inn in the German town of
   Sulzbach (Taunus).

Agenda:
   December 3 will feature a full day, professionally developed,
   lecture course covering the Goals and Architecture of the Unicode
   Standard.  It will address the problems posed by support for writing
   systems worldwide and how Unicode's design enables their solution.
   In addition, the course will explore several implementation strategies
   for Unicode and illustrate them with specific examples.  December 4
   will feature invited papers on implementation aspects of Unicode and
   its relation to other standards.  These seminar-style talks will cover
   specific, practical problems and point out solutions, as well as
   provide case studies and demonstrations of Unicode implementations
   underway.

I've just joined this list, so pardon if I'm stating the obvious:  there 
have been a couple of questions about EFL corpora and tagging.  Here at 
HKUST we are compiling a corpora of the written English of Chinese learners; 
it's still early days, but we hope, if funding comes through, to have 5 
million words within a couple of years.  The only other project that I know 
of which is bent on gathering learner English is at the University of 
Louvain in Belgium.  Theirs is, I believe, mainly a European focus.

The two taggers for interlanguage analysis I've heard of, both still under 
development, but due out shortly, are Nijmegen's and one from the 
University of Sydney called COALA.

I'd appreciate hearing of any other work, either on interlanguage corpora 
collection, or tagging/parsing of said.

Letteratura Amica (Literary Amiga) is an Amiga program, under development
for MS-DOS (Windows?).  Better you e-mail Cocchi to discuss its many
features because I am not "into" tagging.

I can say that it works fine, does wonders (I wish I had a facility for
class use with it!), speaks, and is priced right.

To: CORPORA@nora.hd.uib.no


Dear friends,

Simply for the information of those who are preparing electronic texts,
I would like to pass on a legal opinion that I sollicited when I was
approached by scholars interested in using an electronic text database
that I had prepared for my own research.

Current american copyright law restricts the distribution of electronic
texts.  I believe that this is the case for international copyright law,
but I am not sure.  I was informed that recent decisions within the
judicial system have made it unlawful to distribute electronic texts
that have been scanned from copyrighted material.  Current legal
opinion holds that an electronic text is analogous to a photocopied
text.  Researchers do have the right to make one copy of a text that
is copyrighted, but for the purposes of their own research only.
Distribution of that text, even if no exchange of money is involved,
is considered a breach of copyright law.  Current penalties for
include in the worst scenario the impounding and/or destruction of
the machines used to reproduce the copyrighted text.

In short, those who produce electronic texts from copyrighted material
for the purposes of their own research are, for the time being, in
the clear.  Those who would reproduce that material and share or
distribute it to others in any way are incurring a certain risk.
It is not clear that a publisher would have any reason to go after
a researcher who wanted to share materials with his or her colleagues.
However, that researcher would be left open to both criminal and
civil liabilities of various sorts, if indeed the person holding the

It seems I keep seeing mention to NERC, but have only a very sketchy
sense of what it is.  I wonder if someone associated with NERC could
perhaps provide us with information similar to what we received from
the European Corpus Initiative project - i.e., languages covered,
nature of the data, some information concerning constraints on access
or costs, and when the data are expected to become available?  It's
obviously an important project, and I for one haven't yet heard even
these basic aspects of it.  I would like very much to hear more about
it.

I'm looking for American English corpera of relatively current
sources such as newspapers or novels.  I've got a Mac IIsi and a CD-reader.
It, as usual, needs to be economical since I'm an independent scholar,
without University support.  I'm aware of Wordcruncher CD (which has
novels by faulkner, cather, london etc.) and of FrontPageNews which
has annual international wire services text.  The former is a bit older
than I want to be dealing with and the latter has a very cumbersome
search routine.

My purpose is lexical semantic research -- I look at the relationship
between semantics, syntax and pragmatics and want to be able to search
for a given lexical item, and pull up its syntactic and discourse context.

The corpus doesn't have to be tagged -- am willing to do that myself
at this point.

oh, of course, i'm also aware of the Brown and the LUNDES (sp?) corpus but
again am looking for more current corpera.

Anyone with info on such contemporary American English corpera
(newspapers, novels), let me know.


thanks!

The Association for Computational Linguistic Data Collection
Initiative (ACL-DCI) has already put out a CD-ROM that contains
(among other things) the full 1987 and 1988 volumes  of the Wall
Street Journal and part of 1989. I think that you have to be an
ACL member to get it (membership fee approx $40/year, for which
you receive the journal "Computational Linguistics" that does
discuss corpora-related issues now and again) and you have to 
pay a largely symbolic fee (<$100). The drawback is that the 
CD-ROM is in in Unix (High Sierra) file format -- however, I 
understand there exists a relatively cheap version of Unix for
the Mac (sorry I don't have the details).

in fact, the high sierra format is more of a pc format.  in any case,
it reflects the msdos limitations on file name length and so on.

there are drivers for unix machines like the suns which allow access
to these files, but that doesn't make the format a unix format.

there should be drivers available for the mac which allow trivial
access to the acl/dci disks.

The CD-ROM can be read on any PC, Mac or Unix machine. But the texts
are coded with the Unix newline character (LF). Mac uses CR and MS-DOS
CR+LF. So on a Macintosh one will either have to use a program that
understand the Unix newline or use a text conversion utility that
translate LF to CR. On a PC the conversion have to be done from LF to
CR+LF.

On the ICAME CD-ROM (containing Brown, LOB, London-Lund, Kolhapur
and Helsinki corpora), we "solved" problem this by duplicating the data
in 3 directories, one for PC, one for Mac and one for Unix.

Jorge Hankamer's parser for Turkish may be of interest (hank@ling.ucsc.edu).
Below is a talk abstract; he also has a chapter on parsing agglutinating 
languages in the Marslen-Wilson (1989) book, Lexical representation and

		"Morphology and Morphological Parsing"


Abstract: This talk will be a report on a project which I have been
engaged in for about ten years.  The project involves the development
of a computational morphological analyzer as a component of a
text-based study of morphology and syntax in modern standard Turkish.

What I have in mind is to talk about my parsing project in fairly
broad terms, focusing on the interactions between the implementation
of an accurate parser and the development of an accurate grammatical
description of the morphology and phonology of a language.
