Welcome to the text corpora distribution list!

I hope that you will be able to share information, questions, answers,
programs etc. with the other members on the list.

The list is unmoderated, but if necessary, it may be moderated in the
future. It is NOT a LISTSERV list, the addresses are added/deleted
manually. Please send administrative messages to:
CORPORA-REQUEST@X400.HD.UIB.NO and not to the list.
The address CORPORA@X400.HD.UIB.NO should only be used for messages
to the whole list, not for retrieving files etc.

The list will be logged on the machine nora.hd.uib.no, see below how
to access the log files.

It will be possible to upload files, either by mail to
corpora-request (text files and binhex/uuencoded files) or by FTP.
Files can also be sent on diskettes.

The list is hosted at the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities
in Bergen, Norway. Information stored at our machine nora.hd.uib.no
can be accessed in several ways:


FILESERV
========
 
The machine nora.hd.uib.no has been established as a mail
based server for the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities.
Information is grouped in different directories, some of which have
information in Norwegian only.
 
Some of the available directories:

corpora         Information from the distribution list CORPORA, log files etc.

icame           International Computer Archive of Modern English

info            Information on texts, projects etc., mostly in English

konferanser     Information on conferences

mac             Macintosh programs

ncch		Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities
		Information in English

nettinfo        Information on network resources, mostly in English

pc		MS-DOS programs

unix		Unix programs

The server is called FILESERV and runs the DECWRL archive server.
FILESERV accepts three types of commands; several commands can
be placed in the body of the mail message. However, the results will
be sent in one file, so do not request several large files in one
message. The commands are: 
 
Help                        Help file
Index                       Top level index
Index <directory>           Index for a directory
send <directory> <filename> Fetch a file in a directory
 
 
Example:
 
You want to get the index for the CORPORA and the KONFERANSER directories
and the file log.started.920918 (and other log files) in the CORPORA directory.
 
Send the following two notes ("index" and "send" commands cannot be put in the
same message, the "send" commands will then be ignored):

---------------- 

To:      fileserv@nora.hd.uib.no
Subject: whatever
 
index corpora 
index konferanser

----------------
 
To:      fileserv@nora.hd.uib.no
Subject: whatever
 
send corpora log.started.920918 
send corpora log.started.921006 
send corpora log.started.921116 
send corpora log.started.930113 
 
----------------

 
FTP SERVER 
==========
 
The files are also available via anonymous FTP from
nora.hd.uib.no (129.177.24.42).
 
To make use of this server, you must have access to a machine
connected to Internet with TCP/IP and a program running the FTP protocol.
 
Example:
 
To get the directories of the server write the following:

ftp nora.hd.uib.no
anonymous
your-e-mail-address
cd pub
dir
 
The server has a directory for uploading, this is writeable but not readable.

cd incoming
(binary)    (if transfer of programs or 8-bit data)
put xx-program.zip

Please send a note and a description to CORPORA-REQUEST if you upload
any files!

Other commands:
 
get <file>
mget <dir-mask> (to get several files, example: mget *.ex)
cd  <directory> (change directory)
cd ..           (up on level in the directory tree)
binary          (set binary transfer, for transfer of programs or 8-bit files)
ascii           (set transfer of 7-bit text data)


GOPHER SERVER
=============

The information is now also available through our Gopher server at
nora.hd.uib.no (port 70). If you are connected to the Internet (with
TCP/IP protocol), you can get client versions of Gopher for MS-DOS,
Macintosh and Unix. Gopher is a tree structured menu system and several
hundred servers are connected. 

Main menu on the nora.hd.uib.no machine:


                    Internet Gopher Information Client v1.02
