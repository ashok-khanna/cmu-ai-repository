                 The Text Software Initiative
                 ----------------------------
                An international effort to promote
         the development and use of free text software


The widespread availability of large amounts of electronic text and
linguistic data in recent years has dramatically increased the need
for generally available, flexible text software. Commercial software
for text analysis and manipulation covers only a fraction of
research needs, and it is often expensive and hard to adapt or
extend to fit a particular research problem. Software developed by
individual researchers and labs is often experimental and hard to
get, hard to install, under-documented, and sometimes unreliable.
Above all, most of this software is incompatible.

As a result, it is not at all uncommon for researchers to develop
tailor-made systems that replicate much of the functionality of
other systems and in turn create programs that cannot be re-used by
others, and so on in an endless software waste cycle. The
reusability of data is a much-discussed topic these days; similarly,
we need "software reusability", to avoid the re-inventing of the
wheel characteristic of much language-analytic research in the past
three decades.

The Text Software Initiative (TSI) is committed to solving this
problem by working to

     o establish and publish guidelines and standards for the
       development of text software;

     o promulgate and coordinate the development of free TSI-
       conformant software.

The scope of the TSI covers all areas of analysis and manipulation
of all kinds of texts (written or spoken, mono-lingual or multi-
lingual parallel, etc.), including markup of physical and logical
text features, linguistic analysis and annotation, browsing and
retrieval, statistical analysis, and other text-related tasks in
research in computational linguistics, humanities computing,
terminology and lexicography, speech, etc.

The TSI software development effort is distributed, that is, anyone
can contribute on a voluntary basis. This means that tools will be
developed according to the contributors' priorities; however, the
TSI is ultimately working towards the development of a comprehensive
text handling system.

To ensure software compatibility and reusability and enable
distributed development, the TSI is committed to:

     o design and publish program interface conventions
     o determine and publish guidelines for programming style and
       documentation
     o stress separation of code and linguistic data to ensure
       (natural) language independence
     o emphasize breaking high-level text-handling tasks into
       more primitive, reusable functions
     o provide a library of primitive text-handling tools
     o maintain a task list and set priorities
     o circulate information such as progress reports, revisions to
       the standard, availability of new software, etc.
     o set up a mechanism for testing and evaluation
     o maintain mailing lists for comments, bug reports,
       suggestions, etc.

The TSI works in relation with other standardization groups, notably
the Text Encoding Initiative and the Expert Advisory Group on
Language Engineering Standards (EAGLES).

All TSI software is free in the sense defined in the Free Software
Foundation's General Public License, which guarantees the freedom to
copy, redistribute, and modify software, and protects this freedom
by requiring those who pass on the software to include the rights to
further redistribute it and see and change the code.

Distribution of TSI software is accomplished in relation with other
dissemination groups such as the Free Software Foundation, RELATOR,
and the Linguistic Data Consortium. The TSI does not provide
technical support, but organizes a network of voluntary consultants
and support people.

Subject: major resources and lists of resources for text processing


Hello, As part of a tutorial I'm presenting on natural language
processing for information retrieval, I would like to prepare two
brief lists:

    1. A list of "lists" of resources for natural language processing
of text.  I count electronic mailing lists, and archives of those
lists, as such lists of lists when they frequently discuss language
processing resources.  I will also list network servers (FTP archives,
Bitnet LISTSERVs, etc.) as "lists" but even better would be to be able
to provide pointers to regularly maintained files on such archives.

My current list is the following:

  Free electronic mailing lists:
    NL-KR
    IRLIST
    LINGUIST
    EMPIRICISTS
    CORPORA-LIST
    LN
    HUMANIST

  Commercial electronic mailing lists:
    Computists Communique

  Regularly Maintained Lists of Resources:
    /pub/catalog at anonymous FTP site clr.nmsu.edu

Suggestions are welcome. This list of "lists" is intended to be a
one-shot effort that will become immediately out-of-date, but will
have pointed a group of people to maintained resources with a longer
expected lifetime.

    2. A second list of the 10 to 20 most useful, easily available,
non-commercial resources for content-based processing of large (at
least megabyte scale) bodies of text, and how to get them.  (If it
takes more than 50 words to describe how to get them, they fail on
"easily available".)  I want to include only resources that are
robust, available at nominal cost (at least to academics), and have
actually been successfully used by multiple research or application
groups.  Some of the ones I intend to include on the list based on
personal experience are:

    --Treebank corpus (tagged corpus)
    --PC-Kimmo and Englex (morphological analyzer)
    --Perl (programming language)
    --SMART (information retrieval system)
    --JUMAN (Japanese morphological analyzer / segmenter)

I welcome suggested additions to this list, from resource developers
and particularly from resource users based on your personal
experience.  Please do not be offended if you are a resource developer
and I do not choose to list your resource. Brevity is my goal and
there will be significant omissions.

    I will post the resulting two lists back to all newsgroups that
this query is going to, so there's no need to write me asking for
copies.  These two lists will be one shots that will not be
maintained, and will hopefully be soon forgotten in favor of better,
permanently maintained lists.

Many thanks, David Lewis

                            Abstract

1.0  Machine Intelligence

For over fifty years the two main directions in machine intelligence (MI),
neural networks (NN) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been studied
by various persons with many dfferent backgrounds. NN and AI seemed
to conflict with many of the traditional sciences as well as with each other.
The lack of a long research history and well defined foundations
has always been an obstacle for the general acceptance of machine
intelligence by other fields.

At the same time, traditional schools of science such as mathematics and
physics developed their own tradition of new or "intelligent" algorithms.
Progress made in the field of statistical reestimation techniques such as the
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) started a new phase in speech recognition.
Another application of the progress of mathematics can be found in the
application of the Kalman filter in the interpretation of sonar and radar
signals. Much more examples of such "intelligent" algorithms can be found in
the statistical classification en filtering techniques of the study of
pattern recognition (PR).

Here, the field of neural networks is studied with that of pattern
recognition in mind. Although only global qualitative comparisons are made,
the importance of the relation between them is not to be underestimated. In
addition it is argued that neural networks do indeed add something to the
fields of MI and PR, instead of competing or conflicting with them.

2.0  Natural Language Processing

The study of natural language processing (NLP) exists even longer than that
of MI. Already in the beginning of this century people tried to analyse
human language with machines. However, serious efforts had to wait until
the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, and even then,
the possibilities were limited. For over 40 years, symbolic AI has been the
most important approach in the study of NLP. That this has not always
been the case, may be concluded from the early work on NLP by Harris. As a
matter of fact, Chomsky's Syntactic Structures was an attack on the lack of
structural proper-ties in the mathematical methods used in those days. But,
as the latter's work remained the standard in NLP, the former has been
forgotten completely until recently. As the scientific community in NLP
devoted all its attention to the symbolic AI-like theories, the only use-
ful practical implementation of NLP systems were those that were based on
statistics rather than on linguistics. As a result, more and more scientists
are redirecting their attention towards the statistical techniques a
vailable in NLP. The field of connectionist NLP can be considered as a
special case of these mathematical methods in NLP.

More than one reason can be given to explain this turn in approach. On the
one hand, many problems in NLP have never been addressed properly by
symbolic AI. Some examples are robust behavior in noisy environments,
disambiguation driven by different kinds of knowledge, commensense
generalizations, and learning (or training) abilities. On the other hand,
mathematical methods have become much stronger and more sensitive to spe-
cific properties of language such as hierarchical structures.

Last but not least, the relatively high degree of success of mathematical
techniques in commercial NLP systems might have set the trend towards the
implementation of simple, but straightforward algorithms.

In this study, the implementation of hierarchical structures and semantical
features in mathematical objects such as vectors and matrices is given much
attention. These vectors can then be used in models such as neural networks,
but also in sequential statistical procedures implementing similar
characteristics.

3.0  Information Retrieval

The study of information retrieval (IR) was traditionally related to
libraries on the one hand and military applications on the other. However,
as PC's grew more popular, most common users loose track of the data they
produced over the last couple of years. This, together with the introduction
of various "small platform" computer programs made the field of IR relevant
to ordinary users.

However, most of these systems still use techniques that have been developed
over thirty years ago and that implement nothing more than a global
surface analysis of the textual (layout) properties. No deep structure
whatsoever, is incorporated in the decision whether or not to retrieve a
text.

There is one large dilemma in IR research. On the one hand, the data
collections are so incredibly large, that any method other than a global
surface analysis would fail. On the other hand, such a global analysis could
never implement a contextually sensitive method to restrict the number of
possible candidates returned by the retrieval system. As a result, all
methods that use some linguistic knowledge exist only in laboratories and
not in the real world. Conversely, all methods that are used in the real
world are based on technological achievements from twenty to thirty
years ago.

Therefore, the field of information retrieval would be greatly indebted
to a method that could incorporate more context without slowing down. As
computers are only capable of processing numbers within reasonable time
limits, such a method should be based on vectors of numbers rather than
on symbol manipulations. This is exactly where the challenge is: on the
one hand keep up the speed, and on the other hand incorporate more context.
If possible, the data representation of the contextual information must not
be restricted to a single type of media. It should be possible to
incorporate symbolic language as well as sound, pictures and video
concurrently in the retrieval phase, although one does not know exactly
how yet...

Here, the emphasis is more on real-time filtering of large amounts of
dynamic data than on document retrieval from large (static) data bases.
By incorporating more contextual information, it should be possible to
implement a model that can process large amounts of unstructured text
without providing the end-user with an overkill of information.

4.0  The Combination

As this study is a very multi-disciplinary one, the risk exists that it
remains restricted to a surface discussion of many different problems
without analyzing one in depth. To avoid this, some central themes,
applications and tools are chosen. The themes in this work are self-
organization, distributed data representations and context. The
applications are NLP and IR, the tools are (variants of) Kohonen feature
maps, a well known model from neural network research.

Self-organization and context are more related to each other than one may
suspect. First, without the proper natural context, self-organization shall
not be possible. Next, self-organization enables one to discover contextual
relations that were not known before.

Distributed data representation may solve many of the unsolved problems in
NLP and IR by introducing a powerful and efficient knowledge integration
and generalization tool. However, distributed data representation and
self-organization trigger new problems that should be solved in an
elegant manner.

Both NLP and IR work on symbolic language. Both have properties in common
but both focus on different features of language. In NLP hierarchical
structures and semantical features are important. In IR the amount of
data sets the limitations of the methods used. However, as computers grow
more powerful and the data sets get larger and larger, both approaches
get more and more common ground. By using the same models on both
applications, a better understanding of both may be obtained.

Both neural networks and statistics would be able to implement
self-organization, distributed data and context in the same manner.
In this thesis, the emphasis is on Kohonen feature maps rather than on
statistics. However, it may be possible to implement many of the
techniques used with regular sequential mathematical algorithms.

So, the true aim of this work can be formulated as the understanding of
self-organization, distributed data representation, and context in NLP and
IR, by in depth analysis of Kohonen feature maps.

Subject: anxiety words-frequency of usage

I am a Clinical Psychologist, sending a message via Andrew Waywood, looking
at anxiety in children.  As part of a series of studies, I am wanting to
establish a list of words which are anxiety provoking for children at a
variety of ages.  At the very least I would like to find words which are
anxiety provoking for both 8 and 14 year olds.   I will need about 10 words
relating to social threat, 10 relating to physical threat, 20 positive
words
but on the same physical and social themes, and 20 entirely neutral words.

It is important that all the words are used as often in the English
language, that the words can be matched with those of the other types (that
is, anxiety Vs. positive Vs. neutral) , and that all would be easily
understood by the average 8 year old.  If someone can direct me to
references which could answer these questions, I would be most
appreciative.  Please contact Simon Kennedy on:  skennedy@christ.acu.edu.au

Vincent Ooi asks:


Recently, a Chomskyan linguist asked me to find out whether the following
verb phrases (or similar ones), found in many descriptive grammar
books, actually do occur in natural language (as exemplified by
text corpora):

'might have been being', as in 'This building might have been being built'.

or

'He had been being interviewed'.

or

'He will have been being examined'.



As I don't have access to any large corpus at the moment, do you folks know of
such an occurring pattern in the corpora you are familar with?  If so,
what are these sentences and their frequency of occurrence?  If this
pattern does not occur (or rarely), I guess the Chomskyan
linguist has a point regarding the inadequacy of corpora and the
indispensability of arm-chair examples.

--------end of quote----------------------------------------


Your Chomskyan colleague will be elated to learn that my
corpus contains exactly one of each of those verb phrases,
as it consists of the contents of my e-mail.

There was a very good chapter on Chomskyan linguistics in a
monograph published about 15 to 20 year ago at Uppsala University.
It was called something like "Fantastic Linguistics" or "Fantasy
in Linguistics". Chomskyan linguistics has this overwhelming
virtue that being a clownishly distorted model of language
the study and research of its inadequacies, quirks, and general
bone-headedness makes it an inexhaustible source of seminal
papers ("seminal" as in "semen", as in "wanking") . Does a powerful
lot of good to your list of publications. And don't forget to
kowtow to the Great Man twenty times at least in the bibliography.

Hi folks,

Recently, a Chomskyan linguist asked me to find out whether the following
verb phrases (or similar ones), found in many descriptive grammar
books, actually do occur in natural language (as exemplified by
text corpora):

'might have been being', as in 'This building might have been being built'.

or

'He had been being interviewed'.

or

'He will have been being examined'.


In each case, the pattern is (modal) + have-perfective + be-progressive
+ be-passive.

As I don't have access to any large corpus at the moment, do you folks know of
such an occurring pattern in the corpora you are familar with?  If so,
what are these sentences and their frequency of occurrence?  If this
pattern does not occur (or rarely), I guess the Chomskyan
linguist has a point regarding the inadequacy of corpora and the
indispensability of arm-chair examples.

Thanks and regards,
Vincent

I have just searched 120m words of varied modern (mainly post-1990)
British (75%) and US (25%) English texts which is part of our "Bank of
English" at COBUILD. I've got the following four instances. (The first
is interesting in that it occurs as part of a discussion about
natural-sounding English!)

Around 1968, Christopher Cerf (later of Sesame-Street fame) wrote a humor
book called "The World's Largest Cheese" that included a short adventure
story written entirely with the "will have been being" verb form.  (This
book is a lost gem, imho...)  Of course, it was a little self-conscious ;^)

This is actually not an instance of the same pattern -- it is not the
punishment that has been sent home! ("Has been being sent" is not a
complex verb form here.)

   The sentence is: "Ayers states that he has never received a

This is not a good example: if you parse it properly ("his worst
punishment has been / being sent home for the night") you
will see why.

the full verb phrase pattern.

More, from

Cathy Ball:

(edited)....suppose you get access to the LOB corpus and don't actually find
any examples. What would that mean? It could mean that the construction
you're looking for is rare. The LOB corpus is only a million or so words,
which is really not very large compared to say the number of words produced
by a given speaker in his/her lifetime. So not to find something in a
given corpus just means that we really need many more huge corpora, as I think
most people would already agree.

Ken Church:

I searched over nearly 1/2 billion words of text (e.g., AP news,
Hansards, Shakespear, Bible, Wall Street Journal, Brown Corpus, etc)
for "been being" and found only two examples.  (DOE = Department of
Energy abstracts).  In my own opinion, this type of language is
extremely marked.  It is probably only acceptable in a certain kind of
very pompous scientific gobbly gook that might be grammatical, but it
certainly can't be called good writing.

DOE    16808897: The thermal effects , accompaning the deformation process ,
have [[ been being ]] observed for a long time by the experimentalists and
still remain the subject of a large number of publications .
DOE    20996252: In order to heighten the performance of turbocharger of

ted@nmsu.edu:

i would have taken it just the other way.  if i search decades of the
wall street journal and never find such a misbegotten sentence, then
that rather says something strong about the goofy linguistic approach
which assigns equal plausibility to your examples.

(btw, i was just talking on the phone and my girlfriend said that she
'might have been getting sick'.  is that close enough?)

I have just joined the list, so I don't know what went on before, but
from the (first) messages I received, it seems that the following

1.
Work in this aspect of English syntax, which is referred to here under
the general heading of 'thematic organization', HAS BEEN BEING PURSUED
by linguists in the United States and in Europe for some considerable
time, ...  (Halliday, 1967, in some article or book on Clause, p. 1)

2.
She doen't trust us. I SHALL always BE BEING PUSHED away from him by
her. (Galsworthy, quoted by Korsakov, 1969, a book on tenses, if I
remember correctly, p. 144 - he said that this was the only example on
50 000 pages of text)

3.
A group of teachers on a refresher course once ... noticed that there
was a blank in the grammar we were using, against the Passive of the
Perfect Continuous Tenses; after some discussion we accepted the
verdict, as we could not think, on the spur of the moment, of any
possibility of or the need for saying: "I have been being taken." The
next morning, while driving in the office car to the course, I said
that the car was making a rather peculiar noise.  "Yes", answered the
friend who was driving, "the car SHOULD HAVE BEEN BEING REPAIRED all
this week, but it was needed for this course." The situation called for
the pattern, and it emerged without reflection ...

This volume contains a selection of the papers read at the
Thirteenth Conference on the Use of Computer Corpora in English
Language Research (ICAME 13), which was held at Nijmegen, the
Netherlands, in June 1992. The selection has been made so as to
represent the three major activities involved in the use of computer
corpora in linguistic research: the design and compilation of
corpora, their grammatical analysis and their subsequent
exploitation.

Things are moving fast in the discipline of corpus linguistics. This
volume therefore follows developments as closely as possible; not
only in the chronological sense of publishing an account of the most
recent research efforts but also in the sense of paying close
attention to the day-to-day practice of corpus linguistic research.

I'm surprised at this last statement (as well as at Jacques Guy's
vehemence in a previous posting).

     Generative syntax (especially of the Chomskyan variety) says
nothing whatsoever about equal "plausibility" of such sentences,
but only about the *possibility* of them.

     Whether the conditions under which such sentences are
appropriate arise frequently or not is not the domain of the theory.
All it seeks to explain are the (innate) grammatical principles and
constraints that permit or block such structures.

     Furthermore, it is often precisely those structures for which
little or no positive evidence is available that are expected to be
the most revealing of known but *unlearned* principles.

I don't have a corpus example to provide, but I can cook up an
example where it seems perfectly felicitous, in which case a
generative theory must be able to produce it.

     A:  Why didn't my email to C ever get there?

     B:  Well, the system went down yesterday and it
         MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEING SENT just as the machine crashed.

I dunno, does this sound like misbegotten gobblygook to you?

Subject:    Have been being innundated with have been being sentences

Gentlemen... (and Gentlewomen), I could see the conflict coming
when the gauntlet was thrown down about the significance that could
be attached to either no-occurrence or low-frequency of occurrence
of some particular syntactic form in the available corpora. Aspersions
as to the value of corpora, or the value of the grammatical form
itself were immediately conjured up in defense of why things appeared
one way or the other.

We should be more humble at this stage of our knowledge. We don't
know how `representative' any corpus is; and in fact there are
great difficulties in even characterizing the parameters along
which the corpora represent. Spoken language vs. technical language
vs. scholarly text vs. newspaper text; text which has been edited
by a given publication for stylistic conformance, for example,
might not be representative of anything other than how acceptable
some forms are to a certain group of managing editors of a publication.

What we have are sufficient examples to satisfy the existence proof
stage for the construction and at least some indication that it
isn't all that common. We have hypotheses as to why it isn't more
common (i.e. could be regarded as ungrammatical or at least
uneasily grammatical by some fluent speakers; might be systematically
eliminated by editorial grammarians seeking a more populist style; etc.)

What impresses me most is the speed whereby the first examples
were found. Clearly corpus-based linguistics passed one test; that
it has now reached the stage where the existence proof for unusual
or hypothetical formations can be tested quickly by those with access
to such resources. I think if ever there was proof of a paradigm
shift, this was it. It is important to incorporate into one's
speculations about language the fact that now it is readily
determined if and what examples exist. Non-existence doesn't yet
seem to imply much because we can't establish any claims of
representativeness of what we search or how much we find; but
some positive occurrences do make a difference and one which needs
to be included in theoretical judgement.

Dear CORPORA netters,

I am new to this list and have been (being) observing it now quietly for
several weeks, in order to try and figure out what I can passively learn
without bothering you, people. However, I have realized that I need some more
active help.

I am mainly interested in syntax, and would like to introduce computer based
corpus work into my syntax course next year. This would, obviously, involve
getting hold of some corpus/corpora and some toolkit(s). These are my
questions:

(a) Tagging
1. Are there corpora available in both tagged and untagged forms?
2. How theoretically-specific is tagging?
3. Are texts tagged for classification categories or functional ones, or both
   in the same project?
(b) Availability
4. Are corpora and tools available as free-ware? Where?
5. Is there a difference in the quality/size between commercial and free
   software?
(c) Hardware
6. If one was about to buy a (personal) computer now, with corpus work in
   mind, what would be the wildest hardware fantasy, taking foreseeable
   future developments of the field in mind? What would be the priorities in
   cutting down this dream to fit budget restrictions?
(d) Bibliography
7. Is there an introduction into corpus work in electronic form?
8. Any other bibliographical suggestions?

Knowing so little about it, I would like to get answers also to my unasked
questions.

Since this information may be repetitious on one hand, and trivial for many
netters on the other hand, but also valuable to novices like me, I suggest
that contributors send their answers to my private address, and I will
summarize them in a couple of weeks, as is customary on other lists. I will
credit the contributors, unless instructed otherwise.

Hello, Christian,

I believe the discs in this first shipment contain no spontaneous
speech.  The design of the file structure is such that spontaneous
dictation (to be done by journalists only) is to be stored within
directories named "si_tr_jd", while readings of sentences by
journalists is to be kept in directories named "si_tr_j"; only the
latter appears on disc 13-7.1.

As for the difference between short-term and long-term speakers, I
don't have the exact specifications in front of me, but my
recollection is that the "short-term" set was intended to get
relatively small samples from a large quantity of speakers (total of
80 hours from 200 people), while the "long-term" set obtains large
amounts of readings from a smaller number of speakers (total of 65
hours from 25 people).  Apart from this, there is no intentional
systematic difference that I am aware of.

Jacques don't do this. If an SIL-type asked the question you would
probably not sneer at their clownishly distorted model of the world.
Chomskyan or not, s/he is doing the Right Thing when he asks whether
certain constructions are actually attested. As it happens, the
construction type the inquiries are about are mentioned in a lot of
anti- or even pre-Chomskyan grammars of English, so this is not the
time to start a religious war.

LDDS-Linguistic Data on Diskette Service

a new service by LINCOM Europa

LINCOM Europa offers a new service to linguistic researchers. Linguistic
data of the following kind are published and distributed on diskette:

+ word lists + data for comparative language studies + dictionaries +
bibliographical surveys + encyclopedical collections +

Linguistic doctoral dissertations and M.A. theses of all linguistic
disciplines are distributed on diskette by Linguistic Data on Diskette
Service, too.

The advantage of this service is the faster access to hitherto unpublished
material and facilitation of discussion.

Data in all languages are accepted for publication on diskette!

Hallo everybody,

I am researching on the use of semantic information for automatic error
correction. My previous work has been done for Basque, and I would like
to investigate the matter for french, but I need some data and tools.

I would like to know about the availability of the following:

   1) tagged corpora which could be

   2) syntactically analyzed corpus of the style of TREEBANK for english

    OR
      a robust parser which performs superficial syntactic analysis (to be
      used with the corpora)

I will appreciate any information which could lead me to such data and
tools, as well as information about price (if any) of licence, etc.

Thanks in advance,

To: CORPORA@HD.UIB.NO


I hope my request for the following information is not ill-placed but I am
hoping that there are some philosopher/linguist subscribers who can help. A
friend of mine is writing a book and is looking for the origin of the word
"Solipsism". My limited knowledge of the word is that it is a philosophy term
which states that existence is limited to the human mind's thoughts. Thinking
is it - we know nothing other than what we think. I believe Renee Descartes
(17th C. French philosopher??) had the thinking and work done on this
idea/concept, but he didn't have the label 'solipsism'. Who chose the label
"Solipsism"? What other background and origin does the word have?

Any help you can offer would be gratefully acknowledged. Please send your
responses to my e-mail address at D1634@Applelink.Apple.Com@INTERNET# and in a
couple of weeks I will post a summary of the information I receive.

Sincerely,

Hi,

About the origin of the word 'solipsism' the Webster's Ninth New
Collegiate Dictionary says:

n[L solus (alone) + ipse (self)] (1874): a theory holdiong that the
self can know nothing but its own modifications and that the self is
the only existent thing.

Hope that helps.

Is anyone grabbing a day's worth of Usenet, now and then, for research

culture is evolving so fast that one could graph the rise and fall of
slang...

Also, someone mentioned that the Icon language is available free for
Macintosh somewhere.  Can someone give me specific address and directory
(and name) info, so I can ftpmail it to myself?

(Incidentally, the immediate stimulus for this message was seeing a series
of typos where people dropped the letter "r", which I read somewhere was
a sign of repressed aggression, and I was wondering how easy it would be
to see if 'r' is dropped most frequently... ;^)

I know this feeling:'there is a trivial question on the list, I am sure
that there will be enough replies without my own input, so why bother?'
Well... this was *not*  the case with my query, so here it is again.
B.t.w., in response to one answer, I am not a computer person, and I am not
interested in producing new parsers etc., just to be a knowledgable
user of the corpora and the tools. Original message follows:


Dear CORPORA netters,

I am new to this list and have been (being) observing it now quietly for
several weeks, in order to try and figure out what I can passively learn
without bothering you, people. However, I have realized that I need some more
active help.

I am mainly interested in syntax, and would like to introduce computer based
corpus work into my syntax course next year. This would, obviously, involve
getting hold of some corpus/corpora and some toolkit(s). These are my
questions:

(a) Tagging
1. Are there corpora available in both tagged and untagged forms?
2. How theoretically-specific is tagging?
3. Are texts tagged for classification categories or functional ones, or both
   in the same project?
(b) Availability
4. Are corpora and tools available as free-ware? Where?
5. Is there a difference in the quality/size between commercial and free
   software?
(c) Hardware
6. If one was about to buy a (personal) computer now, with corpus work in
   mind, what would be the wildest hardware fantasy, taking foreseeable
   future developments of the field in mind? What would be the priorities in
   cutting down this dream to fit budget restrictions?
(d) Bibliography
7. Is there an introduction into corpus work in electronic form?
8. Any other bibliographical suggestions?

Knowing so little about it, I would like to get answers also to my unasked
questions.

Since this information may be repetitious on one hand, and trivial for many
netters on the other hand, but also valuable to novices like me, I suggest
that contributors send their answers to my private address, and I will
summarize them in a couple of weeks, as is customary on other lists. I will
credit the contributors, unless instructed otherwise.

From: "Richard L. Goerwitz" <goer@MIDWAY.UCHICAGO.EDU>

If you are going to purchase a computer for corpus work, I'd say that
it depends wholly on what you want to do.  Are you a canned application
user or do you program?  If you program, do you prefer a windowing en-
vironment or are you able to use command-line interfaces as well?  What
languages do you program in?  Are you in a networked environment, or
are you planning on keeping this machine isolated at home?

Lotsa questions.

Dear Ron,

Hope you get many useful responses to your query ... I just taught a
seminar on computational tools and corpus analysis, and I could send
you some of the materials, but it would be tough to summarize in one
message! You might look into Judith Klavans tutorial at the summer LSA/ACL
if you're out that way ... in the meantime, not a bad place to start is with
the Oxford Companion to the English Language, s.v. 'corpus'.

============= response #3 ==========================

From:       Dr Lindsay Evett <lje@doc.trent.ac.uk>

Dear Ron,

the best place to start is by getting in touch with:
Humanistisk Datasenter,
Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities,
Harald Harfagresgt. 31,
N-5007 Bergen,
Norway

They have many Corpora available at roughly cost price,
including tagged and untagged versions of the LOB, and a
parsed corpus. The Oxford Text Archive are also a very
good source; cant remember their email adress for the
minute, if someone else doesnt send it to you, get back to
me.

I assume you've seen R. Garside, G. Leech and G. Sampson (Eds)
"The Computational Analysis of Englich: A Corpus-Based Approach"
Longman, 1987

Also well worth a look at is the thesis of one of my students:
F. G. Keenan, "Large Vocabulary Syntactic Analysis for Text
Recognition", Nottingham Trent University, 1993, which
will be on the shelves very soon, and contains an awk
program for mapping between tag sets.

ps The Norway place also produces the ICAME Journal which is
very useful

From: Oliver Christ <oli@ADLER.IMS.UNI-STUTTGART.DE>

Hi,

in reply to your question to corpora@hd.uib.no.

I'm quite new to the field also, so that I can only partially answer your
questions (and not in depth, I suppose). Some of your questions should go into
an FAQ, but until now no one has written one. I send my answers to you directly,
since they are surely only partial.

Ron> (a) Tagging
Ron> 1. Are there corpora available in both tagged and untagged forms?

In principal you can generate the non-tagged version of a corpus with simple
tools like awk, sed, grep, perl etc. There are several tagged corpora, for
example the PENN TREEBANK on the ACL/DCI CD ROM, the Susanne Corpus (you may get
it from ftp.uu.net) and some others, I think. To get very much text in short
time, ftp to ftp.uu.net and look in the etext directories (several GByte).

Ron> 2. How theoretically-specific is tagging?

That depends on the corpus, the tagging method and on the intended use of the
tagged corpus. Look for example at the texts in pub/treebank/parsing and
pub/treebank/postexts/guide-to-tagging.ps on linc.cis.upenn.edu (anonymous ftp).

Ron> 3. Are texts tagged for classification categories or functional ones, or
 both
Ron>    in the same project?

I think both, but this heavily varies between the corpora.

Ron> 4. Are corpora and tools available as free-ware? Where?

Mainly via anonymous ftp to hosts all over the world, also on nora.hd.uib.no.
Very much corpus material is also on the ACL/DCI CD ROM (contact Mark Liberman
[myl@unagi.cis.upenn.edu], he is responsible, as far as I remember).  It costs
about $25. In the next few months a CD with European corpora is about to be
published, contact Susan Warwick for details [susan@divsun.unige.ch].

Ron> 5. Is there a difference in the quality/size between commercial and free
Ron>    software?

I don't know very much about commercial corpus tools. There are some commercial
query/concordancing tools (PET from UWaterloo, for example), but due to our
limited budgets, we don't have any.

Ron> 6. If one was about to buy a (personal) computer now, with corpus work in
Ron>    mind, what would be the wildest hardware fantasy, taking foreseeable
Ron>    future developments of the field in mind? What would be the priorities
 in
Ron>    cutting down this dream to fit budget restrictions?

In my eyes, a personal computer is a too limited architecture for corpus
processing, since you often will need several gigabytes of external (harddisk)
storage and some 16-64 Mbytes of internal RAM. That leads quickly to Unix ...
(Sun Sparcstations or compatibles). Additionally, you will need a couple of MIPS
to get through your texts...

Ron> 7. Is there an introduction into corpus work in electronic form?

The field is still too young, and I don't know of a published introduction to
this area (if you get any answers to this question, please tell me!). I'll
include a small bibliography (incomplete!) at the end of this mail.

Ron> 8. Any other bibliographical suggestions?

See above.

Ron> I will summarize them in a couple of weeks, as is customary on other lists.

Yes, please!

Hope this helps you a little bit,

=========== response #5 ======================================

From:       "Steve Fligelstone" <eia002@central1.lancaster.ac.uk>

Dear Ron,

I suspect that the reason people didn't answer your query was not
so much that they regarded it as trivial, as that your query seemed
to necessitate an awful lot of work on someone's part - anyway,
as I am not in a position to do an awful lot of work, here is a very
brief response:

(*) (a) Tagging
(*) 1. Are there corpora available in both tagged and untagged forms?
yes - LOB is one (1 million words)

(*) 2. How theoretically-specific is tagging?
not very

(*) 3. Are texts tagged for classification categories or functional ones, or
(*)    both in the same project?
Probably both - depends what you mean by function -

(*) (b) Availability
(*) 4. Are corpora and tools available as free-ware? Where?
Yes - TACT and CLAN are two PC programs that cost nothing or nearly
nothing.  Your first stop has to be ICAME (address give below) -they
distribute corpora, programs, documents, bibliographies, a journal,
and this mailing list.

(*) 5. Is there a difference in the quality/size between commercial and free
(*)    software?
Not systematically.  TACT has its fans, so does WordCruncher, which costs.
CLAN is boring, non-interactive program - very useful for batch processing
though.  LMC and MicroConcord are two other proprietary packages which
are aimed more at teaching use.  LMC is great but it can only handle small
files (> 50,000 words) - I haven't really used MicrConcord but my first
impressions were that it was a bit slow and dull.  For Macs there is
something called Free Text Browser (also available through ICAME).
Free Text is also available as UNIX program, albeit with a less attractive
interface, and the CLAN sources are are said to compile under UNIX using
the GCC compiler.

(*) (c) Hardware
(*) 6. If one was about to buy a (personal) computer now, with corpus work in
(*)    mind, what would be the wildest hardware fantasy, taking foreseeable
(*)    future developments of the field in mind? What would be the priorities in
(*)    cutting down this dream to fit budget restrictions?

For personal use:
66 Mhz 486DX2 Processor
VESA Local Bus with Graphics Accelerator (S3 or Weitek) and Caching
                    Hard Disk Controller
16 Megabytes of RAM
400 Megabytes of Filestore
Tower case (they are quieter than desktops and have lots of expansion
                                                  capabilities)
CD-ROM Drive is useful

For Departmental use:

Go for a network  - store all your corpora on the server and let the
connected PCs access them - it's like having a huge hard disk on
every machine.  We do it in Lancaster and it works fine.

For money saving:-

The above configuration is to some extent "future-proofed" it may
seem excessive now but in a year or two it won't.  If you just want to
get stated and think about upgrading in a year or two, go for any
486, even a 486SX (unless you plan to do lots of Statistics or
CAD - in which case avoid the SX as you need the maths co-processor that
the SX lacks), halve the RAM (don't go lower than 8 if you plan to
use the machine to run Windows, and Word-Processing and other general-
purpose packages), halve the filestore, and forget about the Local Bus
and the other "go-faster" bits.  This would probably halve the cost
of the machine at least.

If you are really strapped for cash, you get away with a 386 and
even less RAM.  The point is that I have specified machines above
to act as good, fast, Windows machines.  In fact, most Concordancing
software is still not Windows-based, and doesn't need all that power.
However, if you don't have a machine capable of running Windows well,
you are likely to feel disadvantaged very quickly if you intend to use
other kinds of software.

(*) (d) Bibliography
(*) 7. Is there an introduction into corpus work in electronic form?

See the Altenberg Bibliography (from ICAME)

(*) 8. Any other bibliographical suggestions?
(*)
Best research surveys are the Rodopi and Mouton anthologies based
mainly on proceedings from ICAME conferences.

Also:

J Sinclair: Corpus, Concordance, Collocation (Oxford)
C Butler (Ed) 1992: Computers and Written Texts, Chapter 5: Computers
                       and Corpus Analysis (by me and Geoff Leech) - Blackwell
Garside, Sampson and Leech: The Computational Analysis of English: a
                    corpus based approach 1987 Longman
(*) Knowing so little about it, I would like to get answers also to my unasked
(*) questions.
(*)
ICAME distribute English Langauge corpora individually, but they now
also have a CD-ROM which for a few hundred dollars/pounds gives you
a lot of corpora for your money - it includes also the TACT program
and the WordCruncher View program.  You can copy any or all of
these on to a hard disk, though I don't know what the licensing
implications of this would be.

========= response #6 =====================================

From: <ted@NMSU.Edu>

   (a) Tagging
   1. Are there corpora available in both tagged and untagged forms?

in english, yes.  in japanese or spanish, you could produce your own
by running taggers which are available and then correcting (or not)
the output.

   2. How theoretically-specific is tagging?

about as theoretically-specific as nouns and verbs.  if you believe in
words, and believe the segmentation of the tagger, then there is
generally a reasonable interpretation of the tags in any orthodoxy you
care to pick.  the tagger probably can't make some distinctions you
would like to make, and there are probably some distinctions you don't
care about, but otherwise, the tags should be of the sort that you can
shoehorn into your particular religion.

   3. Are texts tagged for classification categories or functional ones, or both
      in the same project?
   (b) Availability

care to explain this?

the texts which were used as training data for the construe system are
available via ftp.  these texts are categorized according to the
reuters news story classification.  is this the sort of categorization
you meant?

you may also be able to get access to the muc and tipster texts which
have some text category markings.

   4. Are corpora and tools available as free-ware? Where?

not really.  since the corpora are copyrighted, you need to sign a
license agreement at the least.  the software for pos tagging and such
is generally freeware or nearly such.

   5. Is there a difference in the quality/size between commercial and free
      software?

there really isn't any commercial software for corpus analysis.

   (c) Hardware
   6. If one was about to buy a (personal) computer now, with corpus work in
      mind, what would be the wildest hardware fantasy, taking foreseeable
      future developments of the field in mind? What would be the priorities in
      cutting down this dream to fit budget restrictions?

this depends on your budget restrictions.  my own preference would be
for a powerful workstation, not a pc.  if you absolutely have to have
a pc, then you probably have strong opinions about the flavor, too.
assuming you want an ibm compatible, then you should get a fast 486
with gobs of memory and gobs of disk and cdrom reader (preferably a
carousel).  you should then run a free version of unix so that you can
effectively use all that memory and processor.  by gobs of memory, i
mean 16MB or more, and by gobs of disk, i mean 1GB or more.  that is,
assuming you really mean to do corpus work.  for much of the work, you
will need much more than 1GB of disk (and for some, you will need mcuh
more than 16MB of memory).  for simple things, the 16MB/1GB
combination will suffice.

you should also make yourself familiar with some programming language
that will help ou work with texts.  awk or perl would suffice.  icon
would probably be better.

   (d) Bibliography
   7. Is there an introduction into corpus work in electronic form?

not that i know of.

============ response #7 ===============================

From: SKIESLING@GUVAX.BITNET

I think your problem is that you asked too many questions. What you
ask could fill at least one - if not more - graduate courses. In fact,
I just took one with Cathy Ball this spring here at Georgetown. It
looks as if you want us on the list to do a lot of research for you.
It's all out there, just look for it. Here a a couple of starting
points:

Aijmer, Karin and Bengt Altenberg, eds. 1991. English Corpus
Linguistics. London: Longman.
Johansson, Stig and Anna-Brita Stenstrom. 1991. English Computer
Corpora: Selected Papers and Research Guide.

You might also try the MLA bibliography under corpora or corpus and
linguistics, likewise in your library's card catalog.

Happy hunting!
Scott

=========== response #8 ================================

From: "Evan L. Antworth 214/709-3346" <evan.antworth@sil.org>

For starters, get hold the the book "The Humanities Computing Yearbook,
1989-90", ed. Ian Lancashire, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1991. It is very
expensive, so try the library. It will answer many of your questions.

To: CORPORA@hd.uib.no
Subject: corpora.bib

After Ron Kuzar has posted the (still rudimentary) corpus bibliography I sent to
him to the net, I think it would be a good idea when this bibliography is
'moderated' in the sense that there is a central depository for it and someone
who puts in new entries. I would volunteer to do this and to put the
bibliography on our ftp server here (ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de) in the directory
pub/corpora as corpora.bib. New entries which are being sent to me will be added
to it. Please try to send any contributions to the bibliography in bibtex
format, since converting other formats to bibtex takes lots of time (which I
don't have).  Please don't cross-send bibliography-releated messages to the net,
I will summarize relevant changes in this newsgroup.

In the same directory, a file 'corpus-bib.dvi' can be found -- this is a more
readable (and printable) version of the bibliograpy (BTW: sometimes, 'ls'
doesn't show directories on our server, so use 'dir' instead).

The labels for the entries are generally constructed out of the list of authors
separated with slashes ('/'), and the year of publication appended with a colon
(':'). If there are multiple entries with the same label, lowercase letters are
appended to the year field.

The e-mail address in the header of the bibliograpy should read
'oli@ims.uni-stuttgart.de', but bibtex doesn't like at-signs at any other places
than the beginning of entries.

Best regards,

Oli

The ICAME bibliography is really fine (and huge), but unfortunately not in
BibTeX format (or did I miss one of the files there?). I don't know how many
people use bibtex, but I always use it for my bibliographies. In my eyes, it is
too much work to convert such a huge bibliography like the one of ICAME to
bibtex, so I think I (we?) have to start a bibtex database with the relevant
citations from scratch.

I don't think that I'm duplicating the ICAME bib -- if I wanted to, I'd use cp.

Oli

Hello all.  Sometime next year I'm about to start using the

this corpus.  I know that people at Leeds and Cambridge have
used it already.

    Does there exist a program (for Unix or PC) which provides for

    too many, i.e. also wrong, features - the human look at the context
    will select the right ones)

    Or, similarily, of German conjunctions?

With pleasure.  All published drafts of the TEI's Guidelines for Text
Encoding and Interchange are available by Listserv from uicvm.uic.edu,
or by anonymous ftp from a variety of sites.  The chapter on spoken texts,
first published in April 1992, may be retrieved under the file names

   p234.p2x (an SGML-tagged version of the prose text)
   p234.ref (an SGML-tagged version of the reference material)
   p234.tex (a LaTeX version of the prose text only)
   p234.doc (a 'screen-readable' formatted version of the whole thing)
   p234.ps  (a postscript version)

from the servers listed below.  N.B. this chapter is old and some of its
descriptions of its interface to the rest of the TEI scheme are now out
of date.  It is no longer numbered chapter 34.  And also our formatting
macros are better now than they were when this chapter was prepared.

To retrieve the file from the Listserv server in Chicago, send mail to

   listserv@uicvm.uic.edu      (or to listserv@uicvm on Bitnet/Earn)

containing one or more lines of the form

   get p234 ps
   get p234 p2x
   get p234 ref

Most TEI drafts are also available from a list server at the university
of Goettingen:  send mail as described above to

   listserv@ibm.gwdg.de       (or, for EARN sites, Listserv@dgogwdg1)

Anonymous FTP service is generously maintained by friendly individuals
at the following sites, in the directories indicated.  Thanks to Paul

The Text Encoding Initiative is a cooperative undertaking of the
Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH), the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL), and the Association for Literary and
Linguistic Computing (ALLC), to formulate and disseminate guidelines for
the encoding and interchange of machine-readable texts intended for
literary, linguistic, historical, or other textual research.  The current
draft of the TEI Guidelines bears the document number TEI P2 and is
being published in fascicles (which is what you will see when you use
the ftp servers just named).  The TEI Advisory Board has just approved
the current cumulative draft; over the course of the summer, some
editorial cleanup will take place, followed by publication of the
Guidelines (under the number TEI P3, which will no longer be labeled
a draft) sometime this fall (probably October/November).  For further
information contact either of the editors, or subscribe to the
listserv list TEI-L at UICVM.  Send mail to listserv@uicvm.uic.edu

In reply to a query from Ron Kuzar, Oliver Christ says, "The field is still
too young, and I don't know of a published introduction to this area." The
field is not, in fact, 'young' though it is certainly suddenly in vogue. A
brief introduction will be found in the 1991 volume English Corpus Linguistics
published by Longman. The article is by one of the major contributors to
corpus linguistics, Geoffrey Leech. The title is 'The State of the Art in
Corpus Linguistics.' For further information about corpus linguistics send a
message to
FILESERV@HD.UIB.NO
with the following lines:
send icame bibliography.1991
send icame bibliography.1992
The bibliographies are part of the information available from the Humanistisk
Datasenter to which Dr. Lindsay Evett referred in his reply to Ron's query. To
find out more about what is available from the Humanistisk Datasenter, send
the following message to the same address:
send icame file.servers
ICAME is the acronym for the International Computer Archive of Modern English.
Also, there is a database at the University of Montreal which, as of 93 April
15, reported 1000 entries under the heading Corpus Linguistics and Dialect
Study. To find out more about this database, contact sabourco@ere.umontreal.ca
For 15 years Sabour and his group have been compiling a bibliographical
database on all aspects of computer processing of natural language. It
currently has about 67,000 references!
As for hardware, the notion that 'a personal computer is a too limited
architecture for corpus processing...' is certainly subject to challenge.
Which personal computer? What configuration? Most important, what are you
trying to do? As an earlier respondent noted, it's not wise to even think of
buying hardware until you have answered that question.

Nancy

Hello all--

Besides JUMAN, is anyone aware of good corpus analysis tools for
Japanese?  I would be interested in tagging / search software as well as
parsers.  ftp addresses for the most recent versions of such tools
-- including JUMAN -- (or pointers to such addresses) would  be most welcome.

Thank you in advance.

Reply-to: prieto@research.att.com


 I would appreciate any information or pointers about the
existence of Spanish databases with the any of the
following characteristics:

1/ Spanish text with parts-of-speech labels.

2/ Spanish text with syntactic labels.

3/ Spanish speech (any dialect) with phoneme segmentation.

4/ Spanish speech (any dialect) with some kind of
prosodic labelling.

  I would also appreciate any information on commercial and
non-commercial programs for Spanish text processing:

1/ parts-of-speech taggers

2/ syntactic parsers


  Please reply to my address, and I'll summarize the
responses to the list. Thanks in advance,

*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*
          THE OXFORD TEXT ARCHIVE IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE...
*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*--*

   *  a new Short List of titles held at Oxford
   *  40 titles now available in TEI format for anonymous FTP
   *  a new FTP service for licensed access via the Internet

It's been a long time since we posted any news of our activities to
this or other lists.  It's not that we've been inactive -- quite the
opposite in fact.

* We have been converting texts to a standard TEI-compatible mark up
  (with much appreciated help from Jeffrey Triggs at Bellcore, and
  John Price-Wilkin at Virginia).

* We have been experimenting with ways of saving time and money by
  using FTP, Gopher, WWW etc to deliver material rather than tapes and
  disks

* We have been scouring the networks for new material of all kinds

* We have been trying to find some additional and reliable sources of
  funding, but cannot report much progress. Any philanthropists out
  there, please form an orderly queue.

                 ***** NEW ACCESSIONS ******

  Our latest catalogue lists 1336 titles, in 28 languages. We have
about 1.2 Gb of textual data, most of it freely available, some of it
restricted in one way or another. We want more. We're particularly
interested in scholarly minority-interest material which is not going
to turn up on CD-anything in the foreseeable future. We don't charge
fees to look after your material, and we keep track of what happens to
it. We do our best to make sure that whatever texts you deposit with us
are rendered as future-proof as we can make them but we don't change
the information you recorded. We're archivists, not evangelists, for
electronic text.

At the same time, now that some kind of standardization is at last
beginning to appear, we're eager to show that old wine can be put into
new bottles. So you'll find that quite a few texts are now available in
more than one form -- both the original, and a "TEI-compatible" form.
(When the original form is easily available elsewhere, and particularly
when the TEI form has more information in it, then we may well drop the
former from the catalogue. But don't worry: it's still in the
Archive....)

         *********** NEW FTP SERVICES *************

Our ftp address is: ota.ox.ac.uk. You can log on as anonymous,
quoting your e-mail address as a password.

If you don't know how to use FTP, ask someone at your local computer
centre. If someone there runs a Gopher, or WWW server, get them to
point the little critter at the following useful files, which you
can also download from the above address:

   ota/textarchive.list         our current catalogue
   ota/textarchive.info         information file + order form

There are two classes of texts available from this FTP server

(a) texts which are in TEI format and which we can make freely
    available (these all appear as category P texts in the shortlist)

(b) texts which are available only under our standard conditions of
    use, (these all appear as category U or A in the shortlist)

[Just to confuse the issue, there are also texts which appear as
category P texts in the Shortlist, because they are freely available,
but which we have not yet checked or converted for TEI compatibility,
and which are therefore not available from our FTP server, though you
may well be able to get them from someone else's. We will distribute
them in the same way as (b) class texts if you insist.]

A CLASS TEXTS (Freely Available)

You can just download these without formality using standard FTP
commands. In some cases there are additional usage constraints,
specified in the TEI header. We also hope that you won't redistribute
these texts in a mutilated state or without acknowledgment of where you
got them from. We can't enforce any of these things, obviously. We
think that the Internet is successful because -- and as long as --
people trust each other.

To see what (a) class texts are available now, just take a look in the
directory ota. It's arranged, like the ShortList, by language, and
within that by Author. There are x texts in there today, and there will
be more. Each text has a conformant TEI header, and each text is a
legal TEI compatible document, using a special document type definition
(dtd), which you can also download from the same directory (look in
ota/TEI). Eventually, there'll be some more introductory stuff on what
SGML is, why the TEI is a Good Thing etc etc. Just now, we're working
flat out getting the texts in there.

Here's the list of what was there when I prepared this note:

Anonymous: Gammer Gurtons Needle
Edgar Rice Burroughs: A Princess of Mars
Wilkie Collins: The Woman in White
Joseph Conrad: Lord Jim; Nigger of the Narcissus
Charles Darwin: Origin of Species
Arthur Conan Doyle: Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; Casebook of Sherlock
   Holmes; His last bow; Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes; Sign of Four; Valley
   of Fear; Hound of the Baskervilles; Return of Sherlock Holmes; A study
   in Scarlet
Henry James: The Europeans; Roderick Hudson; The Watch
Jack London: Klondike Tales; The Seawolf; The Call of the Wild; Whitefang
Andrew Marvell: English Poems (1688)
Herman Melville: Moby Dick
John Milton: Paradise Lost
Lucy M. Montgomery: Ann of Avonlea
William Morris: News from Nowhere
Baroness Orczy: The Scarlet Pimpernel
Bram Stoker: Dracula
Antony Trollope: Lady Anna; Ayalas Angel; The Eustace Diamonds;  Can you
   forgive her; Phineas Finn; Phineas Redux; Rachel Ray; Dr Wortle's School;
Mark Twain: A Connecticut Yankee at the court of King Arthur
H.G. Wells: The Invisible Man; The War of the Worlds; The Time Machine


(B) CLASS TEXTS : (Restricted access)

The majority of texts in the Archive are and always have been held in
trust for a Depositor. Rather than keep track of a zillion different
contracts with each Depositor, we worked out a single contract which is
the basis of our standard user declaration form. It has served to keep
us out of the law courts for the last twenty five years, so it can't
have been all bad.

Because it's a contract, we have to have a signed paper copy of the
declaration in our hands before we can issue copies of the texts. Once
we have that declaration, we can send you copies of restricted texts, on
diskette, cartridge or magnetic tape, or even over the network.

Up till this week, the only way you could get copies of (b) class texts
over the network was to tell us an account and password on your
machine. We would then bash the files across to you, for free. This was
a rather unsatisfactory procedure in several ways: we think we now have
a better one. It's still free and it works like this:

- you send us a signed order form, as usual
- on the order form you specify the password of your choice
- we place copies of the files you ordered in a special directory under ota,
  access to which requires you to quote both a personal identifier (which we
  will give you) and  the password (which you have told us)
- we send you e-mail giving details of how to access the directory
- you download copies of the files you ordered, using conventional ftp
  commands
- after a fixed period of time (usually about a week) your personal
  identifier is  removed and the file copies deleted

         **********THE DOWN SIDE************

We save until the very end of this note the inevitable piece of bad
news. After 25 years, we've been told very firmly that we have to
increase our prices to something a bit nearer a realistic level. Not
only that, but within the European Community we must charge VAT at 17.5%
on every order. We've taken this opportunity to rethink the way in which
we charge slightly.

We charge only for material costs, postage and packing on orders for
texts sent on magnetic media of various kinds. We have abolished the
"per text" fee, and we are no longer insisting on payment in advance.
We are still charging over the odds for diskettes because they take us a
disproportionate amount of effort to produce.

The cost is worked out as follows:

     Magnetic tape:        #50 ($80) each
     DC350 tape cartridge  #30 ($50) each
     Diskette              #20 ($35) each

     Invoicing charge      #10 ($20) payable if order is not prepaid
     Postage surcharge     #10 ($20) for orders outside EC
     Add VAT at 17.5%                for orders within EC

We will continue to give an estimate for the cost of any order free of
charge. And, of course, if you use our new FTP service, then you don't
need to pay us a penny.

We look forward to hearing from you in the new academic year!

CALL FOR PAPERS

A new journal on QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS will be launched in 1994.  Authors
are invited to submit 4 copies of their article providing it is within the
scope of the journal.

Scope

The Journal of Quantitative Linguistics is a new international forum for the
publication and discussion of research on the quantitative
characteristics of language and text in an exact mathematical form. This
approach, which is of growing interest, opens up important and exciting
theoretical perspectives, as well as solutions for a wide range of practical
problems such as machine learning or statistical parsing, by introducing into
linguistics the methods and models of advanced scientific disciplines such as
the natural sciences, economics and psychology.

Specifically, JQL will publish papers on:

1) Observations and descriptions of all aspects of language and text
phenomena, including the areas of psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics,
dialectology, pragmatics, etc. as far as they use quantitative mathematical
methods (probability theory, stochastic processes, differential
and difference equations, fuzzy logics and set theory, function theory etc.),
on all levels of linguistic analysis.

2) Applications of methods, models, or findings from quantitative linguistics
to problems of natural language processing, machine translation, language
teaching, documentation and information retrieval.

3) Methodological problems of linguistic measurement, model construction, sampli
ng
and test theory.

4) Epistemological issues such as explanation of language and text phenomena,
contributions to theory construction, systems theory, philosophy of science.

Audience

The Journal of Quantitative Linguistics will be important reading for all
researchers in the following disciplines who are interested in quantitative
methods and observations: linguistics, mathematics, statistics, artificial
intelligence, cognitive science, and stylistics.

The Journal is edited by Reinhard Koehler, linguistische Datenverarbeitung,
University of Trier, Germany and will initially have 3 issues a year.

From: " (02-Aug-1993 1654)" <eijk@cecehv.enet.dec.com>
To: corpora@x400.hd.uib.no
Subject: Looking for medical texts


I am looking for text corpora in the domain of
medicine to test some software we've been developing.
I have heard about a corpus of radiology reports that
is available for research,  it is mentioned on the DCI
CD ROM. Does anybody have any information (a contact)
for this or other corpora ?

If availability of such corpora is restricted by e.g.
privacy restrictions,  then perhaps "anonymized" versions
could be produced ?

Pim.

I am interested in any material regarding how to design a large bilingual

parallell corpus of English-Swedish texts in the field of technical
documentation. There is an article in The Journal of Literary and Linguistic
Computing Vol. 7 No. 1, 1992 by Sue Atkins and Jeremy Clear entitled Corpus
Design Criteria, where they have a thorough discussion about setting up
corpora in general, but not how to deal with parallell (bilingual) corpora.

Any hints?

In one sense this is not a strict corpus linguisitc request but
I could think of few other places to ask the question.  I will
shortly begin work at a communications studies institute and
we will be dealing with a number of vary large corpora of video
taped material (i.e. news reports etc.)  Does anyone know of
ethnographic, or similar, software, running on any system,
PC, Apple, Sun, VAX that could cope with digitised video images?
I realise that many Mac Hypercard based systems could but not
to the level I might require?  If anyone can think of a better list
or someone to contact please let me know.

Subject: US parser 'challenge'
To: corpora@hd.uib.no


At  a recent conference on corpus linguistics in Spain (early Aug) Ed Hovy
mentioned that there's some kind of yearly challenge for (syntactic I think
) parsers. Apparently 'contestants' get a series of setnences or whatever in a
sealed brown paper envelpe (or equivalent) and they have to submit their
machine parses.

The winner this year was apparently a parser which parses on the basis of a
simple two-word window.

Does anyone have any information on the 'contest' etc, and especially this
year's 'winner'? Failing that, does anyone have Ed Hovy's email number, or
was anyone at the conference and knows the references etc?

Subject: Scottish Data


Scottish Data

For a paper I've to give next month, I'm trying to compile as
complete a list as possible of all machine-readable data from
Scotland that exists, no matter what purpose it was originally
gathered. I'm thinking especially of transcriptions of Scottish
speakers including digitisations, no matter what their Scottish
accent or whether you would call it Scots, English or anything
in between. I'm also thinking of written originating in scotland by
Scottish people, not necessarily fictional writing, but any
kind of writing.

If you've compiled anything of this sort - or know of any
such compilations, please let me know. Please assume I don't know
about so that you will get in touch! I will be most grateful
and your assistance will be gratefully appreciated.

I look forward to hearing from whoever ...

Simeon Yates asked about software to cope with digitised video images.  You
might try GAINMOMENTUM.  I've just heard of it, so can't tell you much: it's
in the category of multimedia database systems.  It's VERY expensive and may
be more than you need.  Published by SYBASE:

                       CALL FOR PAPERS

                TEACHING AND LANGUAGE CORPORA 94

           Lancaster University 11 - 13th April 1994


AIMS OF THE CONFERENCE

While the use of computer text corpora in research is well
established, they are now being used increasingly for teaching
purposes.  This includes the use of corpus data to inform and
create teaching materials; it also includes the direct
exploration of corpora by students, both in the study of
linguistics and in the study of foreign languages.  We
would like to bring together researchers and teachers who
are involved in such work in order to encourage an international
exchange of experience and expertise.  We intend to keep costs
to a minimum, and hope to be able to charge attendees no more
than #{Sterling}50 a day, including accommodation and food.

Papers are invited on the following topics:

*   the uses of corpora in the teaching of linguistics
*   the uses of corpora in the teaching of foreign languages
*   software for the use of corpora in teaching
*   corpus annotation
*   issues concerning funding and resourcing
*   availability of corpora
*   necessary skills (teacher and learner) for exploiting corpora
*   applications of spoken corpora
*   computational linguistics

By "corpora" we mean:

*   corpora of written and spoken language
*   multi-lingual (e.g. parallel or translation) corpora


FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION

The conference will be composed of oral and poster presentations,
as well as some discussion groups.  A paper should last for 30
minutes including questions, and a poster presentation may consist
of up to eight sheets of A3, including the title page.  If you
wish to offer a presentation of either kind,  please submit an
abstract by no later than 30th September 1993.   Abstracts should
be no more than 300 words long.  It would also help us if you would
complete the attached reply form and return it as soon as possible.

All papers accepted for the conference will be reviewed and
considered for the conference proceedings, which we intend to
publish.  Any papers selected for publication should then be
submitted in machine-readable form, either ASCII or word-
processor (preferably Word or WordPerfect).

Email submission of abstracts are encouraged.
