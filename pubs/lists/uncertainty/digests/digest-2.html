Gentle reader:

Sumex has entertained a request from the uncertainty list to keep an
archive of software from which readers contribute to, and retrieve
copies by ftp.  Please let me know of software for distribution that I
can retrieve for the archives, or pointers to sources that I should
look into.  One item that I have recently heard of is a demo version
that Noetic Systems is about to release of their Macintosh product. I
will be collecting copies of such programs of interest as I hear about
them. 

On another note of interest, I hear that the current copy of AI
magazine contains several articles about uncertain reasoning.

Also I'd like to bring to attention a clipping from comp.ai.shells,
about a call for papers, on an IEEE Workshop on AI for customer
service and support.  Most notable about its description is that,
among the list of techniques of interest, there is no mention of
probability based techniques!  I find this area of application
particularly interesting.  I solicit discussion from others who have
thought about this.  For those who might be interested in the
workshop, contact Anil Rewari <rewari@aiag.enet.dec.com>. The deadline
for submissions is Jan 10th.

 Please use the address

agosta@sumex-aim.stanford.edu

for both submissions and for address change requests.

      Many of you will be glad to know that a second printing of my
book "Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems" (Morgan
Kaufmann) has just come out off the press. Those of you who were kind
enough to point out errors, typos, and (small) omissions in the first
printing, should be pleased to find those corrected.

I have tried to include as many references as possible to new results,
reported in the three-year period since the first printing (August
1988). However, constrained by severe space restrictions, much of this
new material had to be exposed via the exercises.  For example, a
recent debate on the pros and cons of the Dempster-Shafer approach
(IJAR,Nov 1990) has been condensed into exercises containing all the
canonical examples that were brought up in that debate. New results in
network-discovery, default reasoning and uncertainty propagation have,
likewise, been described as exercises, gradually leading the reader
toward the intended conclusions.

I hope you find the second printing a more pleasant text to teach
from, and a more complete reference to work with.  Also, the publisher
will be glad to send you solutions to selected exercises.

Do the Right Thing: Studies in Limited Rationality
Stuart Russell and Eric Wefald
MIT Press, 1991

It is proposed that classical notions of perfect rationality, and
descriptive approaches to bounded rationality, should be replaced by
the notion of "bounded optimality", a property not of individual
decisions but of certain "programs" within finite machines.  The rich
structure of actual intelligent agents results from the pressure for
optimal behavior operating within systems of limited resources.  New
designs for new intelligent systems are outlined, and a theory of
rational metareasoning is described that enables programs to control
their own reasoning effectively. These methods are based on the
application of decision theory to the problem of selecting
computational actions.  A simple compilation process allows such
metareasoning to be done efficiently.  The theory is applied to
game-playing and real-time problem-solving, with surprising results.
