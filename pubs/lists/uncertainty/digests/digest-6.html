       NINTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

                      July 9-11, 1993, Washington D.C.

                               CALL FOR PAPERS

The ninth annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence will
devoted to methods for reasoning under uncertainty as applied to problems in
artificial intelligence.  The conference's scope covers the full range of
approaches to automated and interactive reasoning and decision making under
uncertainty, including both qualitative and numeric methods.  

We seek papers on fundamental theoretical issues, on computational techniques
for uncertain reasoning, and on the foundations of alternative paradigms of
uncertain reasoning.  Topics of interest include:

 -  Foundations of uncertainty concepts 
 -  Representations of uncertain knowledge and their semantics
 -  Knowledge acquisition
 -  Construction of uncertainty models from data
 -  Uncertainty in machine learning
 -  Automated planning and decision making under uncertainty
 -  Algorithms for uncertain inference
 -  Pooling of uncertain evidence
 -  Belief updating and inconsistency handling in uncertain knowledge bases 
 -  Explanation and summarization of uncertain information
 -  Control of reasoning and real-time architectures

This year, we hope to attract more contributions that emphasize real-world
applications of uncertain reasoning.  Questions of particular interest
include:

- Why was it necessary to represent uncertainty in your domain?
- What kind of uncertainties does your application address?
- Why did you decide to use your particular uncertainty formalism?
- What theoretical problems, if any, did you encounter?
- What practical problems did you encounter?
- Did users of your system find the results or recommendations useful?
- Did the introduction of your system lead to improvements in reasoning
    or decision making?
- What methods were used to validate the effectiveness of the systems?

Papers will be carefully refereed for originality, significance, technical
soundness, and clarity of exposition.  Papers may be accepted for presentation
in plenary or poster sessions.  Some key applications oriented work may be
presented both in a plenary session and in a poster session where more
technical details can be discussed.  All accepted papers will be included in
the published proceedings.  Outstanding student papers may be selected for
special distinction.

Five copies of each paper should be sent to one of the Program Co-Chairs by
February 5, 1992.  The first page should include a descriptive title, the
names, addresses, and student status of all authors, a brief abstract, and
salient keywords or other topic indicators.  Acceptance notices will be sent
by March 29, 1992.  Final camera-ready papers, incorporating reviewers'
suggestions, will be due approximately five weeks later.  There will be an
eight-page limit on proceedings papers, with a few extra pages available for
a fee.

AIMS AND SCOPE

The first European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to
Uncertainty was held at Marseilles in 1991, with the initial impetus coming
from an Esprit II Basic Research Action called DRUMS, which was the
major EC project in this area. The first conference was a great success with
around fifty papers being presented, published by Springer-Verlag in their
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

For this, the second conference, we have changed the name slightly to
emphasise the fact that we are not just interested in representing uncertain
information, but also in using and updating it in practical, implementable,
reasoning systems. This meeting is jointly sponsored by the ESPRIT III
continuation of the DRUMS project, and by the newly-formed European
Society for Automated Practical Reasoning and Argumentation (ESAPRA).

We are looking for papers not only in logical, mathematical theories of
uncertainty, and uncertain or defeasible inference, but also in practical
applications, implementations and algorithms.  Papers that elucidate
relationships between logical and numerical approaches, provide general
frameworks for uncertain inference or show how uncertain inference can be
used to solve problems such as abduction and belief revision will be of
special interest. Possible approaches include non-monotonic, modal, multi-
valued, dynamic and resource logics; possibility theory, probability theory
and belief functions; networks, probabilistic databases and fuzzy sets.

Conference presentations of submitted papers will be about 30 minutes and
there will be three invited reviews of major topics. The proceedings will
again be published by Springer. Extended abstracts/papers of around 2000-
4000 words should be submitted to the conference chairman (see submission
information overleaf) by April 5 1993. All papers will be refereed for
interest, originality and technical accuracy, and a decision given by June 4
1993. Final versions of accepted papers (maximum length 8 camera-ready
pages) will be required by July 30 1993.  Longer versions of the best papers
will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Logic and Computation.

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

AAAI-93 Workshop  on  AI  in  Service  and Support: Bridging the Gap Between
			Research and Applications

           	     Washington, D.C. July 12, 1993.
	             ===============================
	
DESCRIPTION:

The areas of customer service and support are poised to be leading areas for
revenue  growth  to companies in the 90's. A 1991 market study shows that 23
percent of high technology service organizations have already begun building
AI  based systems, and 67 percent expect to be using AI within 3 years. This
full-day  workshop will gather researchers and developers who are working on
exploring  or  applying  AI  techniques  (such as expert systems, case-based
reasoning,  model-based reasoning, intelligent information retrieval, neural
networks,  fuzzy logic, etc) in the areas of customer service and support in
industry  as  well  as  government.  The  goal of this workshop is encourage
interactions    between   researchers   (from   university   and   corporate
laboratories)  and  developers of AI systems so as to bridge the gap between
current  research  in  artificial  intelligence and current needs in service
organizations.

TOPICS:

Papers are encouraged in, but are not limited to, the following areas:

- diagnosis
- advisory activities
- information retrieval
- workforce planning and dispatch
- resource and inventory management
- hardware and software configuration management
- automated knowledge acquisition
- emergency response centers
- call center management
- billing and account servicing, and
- various value-added services

Corporate service   organizations   frequently   consist  of  geographically
dispersed  groups  whose  work  is  intertwined. Also, the rate at which new
products are being introduced makes it harder for support personnel to be on
top  of things. Keeping this in mind, we would also encourage researchers in
the  following  areas to participate by focusing on how their research could
be applied to service and support:

- Knowledge Sharing (such as that being conducted by PACT, including Stanford
   University) between functional groups such
   as engineering, service, and billing groups.
- Machine  Learning,  to augment the shortcomings of knowledge-based systems
   currently in use 
- Natural-Language  translation,  for  service  groups  that  are located in
   different countries but use the same underlying tools or applications
- Designing systems for serviceability
- Groupware
- Distributed AI, for example, for allowing various expert systems to work
   cooperatively in a help desk environment

FORMAT OF WORKSHOP:

This will  be  a  full day workshop split into 4 sessions of 90 minutes each
and will include paper sessions as well as panels. The areas of focus of the
paper  sessions  and panels will depend on the range of papers accepted, and
will be specified later.


ATTENDANCE: 

Developers and   reserchers   interested  in  applying  advanced  Artificial
Intelligence  technology  to  the  areas  of customer service and support in
industry  as  well  as  government. This workshop will encourage interaction
between  researchers  and  developers.  In  order to facilitate interaction,
attendance will be limited to 50 people.

SUBMISSSION REQUIREMENTS:

Prospective participants  should  send  4  copies  of papers not more than 8
pages  long (not including the title page and bibliography). A subset of the
participants  will  be  selected  as  speakers.  Those who are interested in
attending  but  do  not  want  to be considered for presentations may send a
detailed  abstract  describing their work and the reasons for their interest
in this workshop.
