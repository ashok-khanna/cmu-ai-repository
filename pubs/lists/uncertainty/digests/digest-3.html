Gentle uncertainty researcher:

This edition marks the first time that we have ftp access to be
able to exchange files. There are two items in the archive in
response to my request for software that solves belief nets, one
a demo copy of Ergo for the Macintosh, the other a description
of how to obtain Ideal from Rockwell Labs. 

Others indicated a desire to post systems when they were ready for
distribution.  David Poole <poole@cs.ubc.ca> has offered to prepare
two items for distribution. One is Prolog runnable specification of
Bayesian networks for teaching purposes. The other is an
implementation, in Prolog, of the probabilistic Horn abduction stuff
presented at the UAI-91 conference.

To archive software or articles, please e-mail me them with a
description attached. I will move them over to the sumex directories
where they can be copied by anonymous ftp.

Subject: Ergo belief network solver


A demonstration copy of Ergo 1.0, the belief-network development
environment for the Macintosh, has been placed in the uncertainty
archives on sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  Ergo lets you use the power of
the Macintosh to develop belief networks with software as familiar as
a drawing program and a spreadsheet.  Ergo consists of a graphical
drawing environment for creating a network, a probability editor for
quantifying the associations among variables, and a probability engine
for querying a belief-network model.  The Ergo engine has been ported
to run within Hypercard and 4th Dimension on the Mac, and within
ToolBook for Microsoft Windows.  Versions of the engine are also
available as C libraries for the Macintosh, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows,
and Unix operating systems.  Thus, belief-network models developed in
Ergo can be embedded within a wide variety of programs to provide the
real-time intelligence required for classification, diagnosis, and
constraint-satisfaction problems.

The demonstration copy of Ergo 1.0 is posted as a binhex'ed
self-extracting archive.  Ergo is a commercial product, available at
corporate and academic prices.  If you have any comments or questions
about Ergo, we'd like to hear from you. You can contact Noetic

Subject: Ideal solver availability

The following is a brief introduction to IDEAL and what you will need
to do to get the IDEAL distribution.

What IDEAL is
--------------
IDEAL is a test bed for work in influence diagrams and Bayesian
networks.  It contains various inference algorithms for belief
networks and evaluation algorithms for influence diagrams.  It
contains facilities for creating and editing influence diagrams and
belief networks. The following paper contains an overview of IDEAL:

  Srinivas, S . and Breese, J. (1990) IDEAL: A software package for
  analysis of influence diagrams. Proceedings of the Sixth Uncertainty
  Conference in AI, Cambridge, MA.

Implementation details 
-----------------------
IDEAL is written in pure Common Lisp and so it will run in Common Lisp
on any platform. The emphasis in writing IDEAL has been on code
clarity and providing high level programming abstractions. It thus is
very suitable for experimental implementations which need or extend
belief network technology.

At the highest level, IDEAL can be used as a subroutine library which
provides belief network inference and influence diagram evaluation as
a package. The code is documented in a detailed manual and so it is
also possible to work at a lower level on extensions of belief network
methods.

As a price of portability, IDEAL, unfortunately, does not come with a
graphic interface on any system except Symbolics Lisp machines. The
code however, is designed to permit a graphic interface to be layered
very easily over it.

Distribution method
-------------------
We usually distribute IDEAL as a large coded file which is mailed to
the new user along with detailed decoding instructions. This file can
be decoded using two standard utilties (uudecode and tar) on any UNIX
system. In case your mail host does not run UNIX, you can move the
coded file (as a saved mail message) to a UNIX machine and then decode
it there. The source code can then be moved to any target machine
running Common Lisp.

The manual comes as part of the distribution. A DVI version and a
Postscript version are provided. You can print whichever is convenient
for you.

We have a slightly specialized version of the distribution for Allegro
Common Lisp on a Macintosh (The specialization has basically to do
with a system utility for loading IDEAL, there is no added or
decreased functionality as compared to the general distribution). If
you would like the Mac distribution, let us know.  Once again, we
usually distribute the Mac version as a coded file that is mailed to
you. The file is meant to be saved, moved to a Mac, and then decoded.
If your Macintosh is not networked then we can send you floppy disks,
but that usually will take some time.

How to obtain the IDEAL distribution
----------------------------------
If you would like us to mail you the IDEAL distribution please let us
know whether you would like the general distribution or the Macintosh
Allegro CL distribution. 

In addition, for administrative purposes, please also send us an email
message where you say you will use IDEAL only for 'research
(non-commercial) purposes'.

AND INFLUENCE DIAGRAMS: A COMPARISON," WORKING PAPER NO.

Abstract:
Recently, we proposed a new method for representing and
solving Bayesian decision problems based on the framework of
valuation-based systems. The new representation is called a
valuation network, and the new solution method is called a fu-
sion algorithm. In this paper, we compare valuation networks
to decision trees and influence diagrams. For symmetric
decision problems, the valuation network representation
method is more expressive than both decision trees and
influence diagrams. We also compare the fusion algorithm to
the backward recursion method of decision trees and to the
arc-reversal method of influence diagrams. For symmetric
decision problems, the fusion algorithm is more efficient than
the backward recursion method of decision trees and more
efficient and simpler than the arc-reversal method of influence
diagrams.

SYSTEMS," WORKING PAPER NO. 236, SCHOOL OF BUSINESS,
University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045.
Abstract:
This paper introduces the notions of independence and
conditional independence in valuation-based systems (VBS).
VBS is an axiomatic framework capable of representing many
different uncertainty calculi. We define independence and
conditional independence in terms of factorization of the joint
valuation. The definitions of independence and conditional
independence in VBS generalize the corresponding definitions
in probability theory. Our definitions apply not only to
PROBABILITY THEORY, BUT ALSO TO DEMPSTER-SHAFER'S BELIEF-
FUNCTION THEORY, SPOHN'S EPISTEMIC-BELIEF THEORY, AND ZADEH'S
possibility theory. In fact, they apply to any uncertainty calculi
that fit in the framework of valuation-based systems.

Excerpts from Ted Shortliffe's Foreword:

For as long as researchers on artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM)
have been working to develop high-performance decision-support tools for
clinicians, they have been struggling with the question of how best to
handle the uncertainty that is inherent in medical diagnosis and therapy
planning.  In the early 1970s, when the AIM field was getting started,
people considered, discussed, and even tried probability theory, but they
tended to abandon it because of four major limitations to applying it
formally:  

1. Inaccuracies due to the perceived practical need to assume
conditional independence

2. Practical difficulties with the assessment of large numbers
of conditional probabilities

3. Cognitive complexity in modifying or updating large tables
of conditional probabilities and their interrelationships, once
the numbers had been successfully gathered

4. Computational complexity that resulted if rigorous
probabilistic approaches were attempted

Thus, in the early systems, uncertainty was handled by a variety of ad
hoc models, of which the certainty-factor model of MYCIN, the
evoking-strength/frequency-weight model of Internist-1, and the
causal-weighting model of Casnet are perhaps the best known.  The
uncertain-reasoning issues addressed in such experimental programs were
in no way specific to medicine, however.  The evolving expert-systems
field has consistently found that uncertainty management is a major
problem in diverse domains.  For example, the Prospector system for
geological exploration, an early expert system developed in the 1970s,
used a subjective Bayesian model to inspire its inference-network
approach to uncertainty management, but the actual implementation
departed sufficiently from classical probability theory that Prospector
also can be viewed as an ad hoc adaptation.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of
more formal probabilistic methods to handle uncertainty in large
artificial-intelligence (AI) systems.  Investigators have concentrated on
knowledge acquisition and on Bayesian inference using the belief network
(also called knowledge map), which is a graphical representation of
uncertain knowledge based on probability theory.  What had bothered me
about most of that work was its theoretical orientation; no one had built
a nontrivial, efficient, and effective system using formal probabilistic
methods.  Until such a system had been validated, I thought that the
concerns of the AI researchers of the 1970s would not have been
addressed.  

In our laboratory, David Heckerman was the first investigator to question
the assumptions that had led AI researchers to develop the ad hoc
models.  Heckerman's analyses provided insights into major limitations of
these models, encouraging him and other researchers to explore how
normative theory could be applied practically within the expert-systems
paradigm.  Heckerman wished to advance the theory of belief networks, and
to show that belief networks could be used to build a large, real-world
system that was effective in its decision task.   Furthermore, he set out
to demonstrate the validity of the approach by undertaking a formal
evaluation.  Heckerman has accomplished these tasks admirably.

Working with colleagues at the University of Southern California (Bharat
Nathwani and Keung-Chi Ng) and at Stanford (Eric Horvitz and Larry
Fagan), Heckerman created a medical expert system that used a
probabilistic model for its management of uncertainty.  This system,
known as Pathfinder, assisted pathologists with the interpretation of
histologic sections of human tissues--initially, from the lymph nodes. 
Reasoning had to account for more than  60 diagnoses and more than 100
descriptive findings; workers in the 1970s would not have used a
probabilistic technique to handle a problem of this size and complexity. 
Heckerman demonstrated that, using a probabilistic framework to elicit
and encode the knowledge of domain experts, he could construct a useful
system.

The large domain of lymph-node pathology helped to motivate Heckerman to
develop graphical extensions of the belief network representation that
would facilitate the assessment of an immense number of probabilities. 
One representation, called a similarity network, permits the incremental
construction of extremely large belief networks from cognitively
manageable subproblems that involve the comparison of two diseases and
their distinguishing features.  Another representation, called a
partition, simplifies the assessment of the conditional probabilities
within a belief network.  This approach to knowledge acquisition has now
been tested extensively by Heckerman and his colleagues in the pathology
domain, and has been shown both to be acceptable to experts and to form
the basis for high-quality diagnostic advice.

...Heckerman's work has convinced me that there are practical methods for
using formal probabilistic approaches in expert systems.   He has built
an impressive diagnostic tool--Pathfinder--and has rigorously
demonstrated its incremental value over earlier approaches.  I believe it
is a rare dissertation indeed that handles the three areas of theory,
implementation, and formal evaluation, as well as Heckerman's does. I
therefore commend this volume to you, and await with enthusiasm further
explorations of both the theory and the application that you will learn
about in these pages.
