		       KR'92 - CALL FOR PAPERS 
				   
		  THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
			    PRINCIPLES OF
		KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION AND REASONING
				   
          Royal Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
	       with support from AAAI, ECCAI, and CSCSI
		      in cooperation with IJCAII
			 October 26-29, 1992

	    (KR'92 follows the AAAI Fall Symposium Series
		 at the same location October 23-25)


The idea of explicit representations of knowledge manipulated by
inference algorithms provides an important foundation for much work in
Artificial Intelligence, from natural language to expert systems.  A
growing number of researchers are interested in the principles
governing systems based on this idea. This conference will bring
together these researchers in a more intimate setting than that of the
general AI conferences.  In particular, authors will have the
opportunity to give presentations of adequate length to present
substantial results.

The theme of this year's conference is the relationship between the
principles of knowledge representation and reasoning and their
embodiment in working systems.  Authors are encouraged to relate their
work to one of the following important questions:

(1) What issues arise in applying knowledge representation systems to
    real problems, and how can they be addressed?
(2) What are the theoretical principles in knowledge representation
    and reasoning?
(3) How can these principles be embodied in knowledge representation
    systems?

Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:

KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION FORMALISMS    REASONING METHODS
- logics of knowledge and belief       - deduction
- nonmonotonic logics                  - abduction
- temporal logics                      - induction
- spatial logics                       - learning
- taxonomic logics                     - planning and plan analysis 
- logics of uncertainty                - constraint solving

			 SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The Program Committee will review EXTENDED ABSTRACTS rather than
complete papers.  Abstracts must be at most twelve (12) pages with a
maximum of 38 lines per page and an average of 75 characters per line
(corresponding to the LaTeX article-style, 12pt), excluding the title
page and the bibliography.  Overlength submissions will be returned.
All abstracts must be submitted on 8 1/2" x 11" or A4 paper, and
printed or typed in 12-point font (10 characters/inch on a
typewriter).  Dot matrix printout, FAX, or electronic submission will
not be accepted.  Each submission should include the names and
complete addresses of all authors.  Correspondence will be sent to the
first author, unless otherwise indicated.  Also, authors should
indicate under the title which of the questions and/or topic areas
listed above best describes their paper (if none is appropriate,
please give a set of keywords that best describe the topic of the
paper).  Abstracts must be received by one of the program co-chairs no
later than April 21, 1992.  Papers received after that date will be
returned unopened.  Authors will be notified of the Program
Committee's decision by June 15, 1992.



			   REVIEW OF PAPERS

Submissions will be judged on clarity, significance, and originality.
An important criterion for acceptance is that the paper clearly
contributes to principles of representation and reasoning that are
likely to influence current and future AI practice.  Extended
abstracts should contain enough information to enable the Program
Committee to identify and evaluate the principal contribution of the
research and its importance.  It should also be clear from the
extended abstract how the work compares to related work in the field.
Submitted papers must be unpublished.  Submissions must also be
substantively different from papers currently under review and must
not be submitted elsewhere before the author notification date (June
15, 1992).


			     FINAL PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers will be expected to submit substantially
longer full papers for the conference proceedings. Final camera-ready
copies of the full papers will be due August 3, 1992. Final papers
will be allowed at most twelve (12) double-column pages in the
conference proceedings (corresponding to approx. 28 article-style
LaTeX pages; a style file will be provided by the publisher).

Call for Papers

This is the third in a series of workshops to encourage interaction
and cooperation among researchers in artificial intelligence with
diverse approaches to diagnosis.  Previous workshops in this series
were held at CISE, Milano (Italy) in 1991 and at Stanford University
(USA) in 1990, with a forerunner at Paris (France) in 1989.

Attendance will be limited to fifty participants with three days of
presentations and substantial time reserved for discussion.

Those interested in participating should submit papers for review by
the committee.  Submissions are welcome on (but not limited to) the
following topics:

   o Theory of diagnosis: abductive, deductive, or probabilistic
theories.

   o  Computational issues: controlling combinatorial explosion;
focusing strategies; controlling inference in complex systems; use,
inference, or absence of structural knowledge.

   o  Modeling for diagnosis: multiple, approximate, incomplete,
probabilistic, and qualitative models; integration of heuristics with
model-based diagnosis; geometric knowledge; dynamic systems; embedded
software.

   o  Integration of diagnosis with control, planning, analysis, theory
construction, tutoring, and design/redesign, testability/
diagnosability/sensor-placement.

   o  Empirical evaluation of theoretical results, theoretical
implications of practical applications and their successes or failures.

   o  Inductive approaches to diagnosis: case-based reasoning, neural
nets.

Although not a requirement, previously unpublished work is preferred.
Papers are limited to a maximum of 5000 words; shorter papers are
encouraged, but space should be used to ensure adequate presentation.
Include postal (and courier) addresses, electronic mail, fax, and
telephone numbers.  Please indicate whether you wish to present or
only attend.  The conference chair (below) must receive three paper
copies of each submission by June 2, 1992, and notifications will be

HUGIN, a Bayesian  Belief Network Shell.
-------------------------------------

HUGIN is a graphical environment for constructing, testing and 
experimenting with knowledge bases represented by Bayesian belief networks.
The graphical user-interface of HUGIN is developed in X-windows and allows
for interactive creation and maintenance of knowledge bases. A compiler 
transforms the Bayesian belief network into an computational efficient 
structure. The compiler offers a variety of options in order to generate
the most efficient structure given the domain at hand, such as efficient
triangulation methods, approximation- and compression capabilities.
A runtime systems provides facilities for easy entering and propagation
of information.

The HUGIN  software is written in ANSI-standard C and provides an application 
programmer's interface (API). The API is a collection of C functions which
provides access to and control of the compilation of Bayesian belief 
networks. It includes functions for entering and retrieving data form 
domain knowledge bases and the necessary functionality to perform 
reasoning. The API can be used in C programs as well as from programs 
written in any language capable of calling external C functions. 
This renders a smooth way of integrating the HUGIN inference engine 
in complex systems.

The HUGIN software represents state of the art in Bayesian belief network
software and has already been proven to be a robust, reliable environment
for building large Bayesian belief networks.

How to get a demo-copy:
---------------------

The HUGIN system version 2.0 is a commercial product, available at 
corporate and academic prices. A demonstration version of HUGIN for the

          Workshop on interval methods in artificial intelligence

          February 26 through March 1, 1993, Lafayette, Louisiana

          in conjunction with the conference on
 
          NUMERICAL ANALYSIS WITH AUTOMATIC RESULT VERIFICATION

   WHY INTERVALS IN AI? Main goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research are to represent human knowledge (both common sense and
expert knowledge) and to process it (i.e. to enable computers to do
thereasoning).  Human knowledge is usually not absolutely precise. 
For example, a phrase like ``the temperature is moderate today''
does not give a precise value of the temperature, but rather an
interval of   possible values.  In many other cases natural
formalization of human knowledge leads to intervals:  in reasoning
about time and actions, in common sense reasoning about physical
quantities, etc.  Similar methods are used to represent human
knowledge about 2- and 3-dimensional images:  e.g., in scene
analysis, in expert systems for navigation, for controlling
themotion of robots, etc.  Different statements constituting human
knowledge have different degrees of certainty:  we are more certain
in some of themthan in some others.  So in addition to representing
these statements,one should somehow represent their degrees of
uncertainty. 

   In traditional mathematics, probability theory is a well-
developed formalism in which probabilities represent such degrees
of uncertainty.If we have complete knowledge of the frequencies
with which different statements turn out to be true, we can get
precise values for the corresponding probabilities.  But in AI such
complete information is usually lacking, so instead of a single
probability we can characterizethe uncertainty by an interval of
possible probability values.  Such a characterization is explicit,
for example, in Dempster-Shafer formalism.  Similar intervals occur
naturally in fuzzy logic and the certainty values approach.

   INTERVAL MATHEMATICS CAN BE HELPFUL. Since information is
represented via intervals, processing this information involves
processing interval data.  AI researchers have invented numerous
new methods for that purpose.  However, Interval Analysis is an
established area of applied mathematics which deals precisely with
processing intervals.  The conference as a whole is devoted to
various aspects of interval analysis.  Within this workshop, held
in conjunction with the conference, interaction between AI
researchers and researchers in interval analysis can lead to the
effective application of interval methods to the solution of AI
problems.

   THE WORKSHOP'S MAIN PURPOSE IS CROSS FERTILIZATION. We want to
bring researchers in interval analysis and researchers who apply
interval methods in AI together.  AI researchers should benefit
from a better knowledge of the state of the art in interval
processing.  Specialists in interval analysis will learn ofmany new
challenging problems of great practical and philosophical
importance, to which they can apply their methods.

   TOPICS. The workshop will cover all possible applications of
interval methods in AI, including (but not limited to):

- intervals in reasoning about time and actions

- intervals in common sense reasoning about physical quantities

- intervals and similar methods in representing 2- and 3-
dimensional images

- intervals in uncertainty representation and uncertainty reasoning
(including intervals appearing in Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy
reasoning, etc).
