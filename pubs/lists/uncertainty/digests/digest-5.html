                         Call for Participation

      THE EIGHTH CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                          Stanford University
                  July 17-19, 1992 (following AAAI-92)

Enclosed are registration materials for the Eighth Annual Conference on
Uncertainty in AI, to be held July 17-19, 1992 at Stanford.  We are sending
our hardcopy mailing to a wider audience than usual this year to announce the
availability of a new component to the conference, a set of tutorials.  Recent
advances in representation and management of uncertainty have the potential to
have broad impact on much of AI.  Our tutorial program is designed to quickly
introduce interested academic and industrial researchers to the core of these
new developments, so that they can explore connections with problems they face
in their own work, access current literature on uncertainty, and get maximum
advantage from attendance at the full conference.

There are several registration options this year, including tutorials only,
conference only, conference and tutorials, and a special "introductory day"
option including tutorials, the first afternoon of the conference, and the
reception to be held the evening of the first day.  Also available is a
housing package in student dorms on the Stanford campus, a five minute walk
from the meeting location.

You will find attached:
1.  Preliminary conference program, including tutorials.
2.  Registration form for the Eighth Annual Conference on Uncertainty in AI.

Please return your registration materials by June 15 if possible.  Housing
fees will be paid directly to Stanford at check-in time, please DO NOT send
funds to cover housing with your registration forms.  DO, however, enclose
conference, tutorial, and banquet fees as appropriate.  Note that there is a
discount for early registration.  On-site registration will be available, but
we encourage advance payment of registration fees (please return the
registration forms even if you plan to pay fees at the conference, so we may
prepare your registration packet in advance.).  Late registration will be
available Thursday (7/16) evening at Crowthers Hall and Friday morning (7/17)
at the School of Law, where the conference will be held.  Housing check-in is
at Stern Hall no earlier than 4pm on the day of arrival.

Details on housing and check-in will be mailed with acknowledgment of receipt
of registration materials.  We look forward to your attendance at this year's
conference.

Preliminary Program

Friday, 17 July  Morning: Tutorials  
(each tutorial will be approximately 50 minutes in length)

Probability and Beyond for Quantified Uncertainty  
(Philippe Smets,   Universite Libre de Bruxelles)

The most popular and best known model to quantify uncertainty is based on
probability functions. Nevertheless there are many ways uncertainty can arise,
and the probability functions are only adequate for modeling some of them.
Beside the stochastic uncertainty and the interval valued models of
probability derived from it, one can also describe vagueness, possibilities
and beliefs, for which new models have been proposed based on fuzzy sets
theory, on possibility theory and belief functions theory.  The tutorial will
present the various forms of uncertainty and the nature and the merits of the
models that are adequate to quantify them. It aims at new comers as well as to
those who defend a single model as being universal.

Default Reasoning and Uncertainty: An overview  
(David Poole, University of British Columbia)

This tutorial gives an overview of work done in the last 15 years on default
(nonmonotonic) reasoning, giving relationships to uncertainty calculi. We
start with the conceptually simplest frameworks, show their limitations, and
then overview work that overcomes these limitations. We start with
assumption-based and argument-based frameworks, describe the "multiple
extension problem", leading to skeptical reasoning and circumscription. We
then consider examples where knowing and not knowing is important which leads
us to default logic and autoepistemic logics. We consider the problem of
preferring more specific defaults over more general defaults, and look at
conditionals. Problems of relevance and irrelevance will be presented. Minimal
model, possible worlds and probabilistic semantics will be used where
appropriate.  A knowledge of basic logic will be assumed.

Bayesian Belief Networks  
(Ross Shachter, Stanford University)

This tutorial introduces the Bayesian Belief net as a representation for
probabilistic knowledge.  Topics covered will include fundamental concepts and
definitions and basic methods for representing probabilistic relationships.
We will then discuss the significance of conditional independence in Belief
Nets and methods which use this information to perform efficient inference.
The tutorial closes with an overview of current status and outstanding
research challenges. This tutorial is targeted at those interested in an
overview of directed graphical representations of probabilistic models, and
who have a basic understanding of probability and elementary graph theory.
