-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a brief introduction to IDEAL and what you will need
to do to get the IDEAL distribution.

What IDEAL is
--------------
IDEAL is a test bed for work in influence diagrams and Bayesian
networks.  It contains various inference algorithms for belief
networks and evaluation algorithms for influence diagrams.  It
contains facilities for creating and editing influence diagrams and
belief networks. The following paper contains an overview of IDEAL:

  Srinivas, S . and Breese, J. (1990) IDEAL: A software package for
  analysis of influence diagrams. Proceedings of the Sixth Uncertainty
  Conference in AI, Cambridge, MA.

Implementation details 
-----------------------
IDEAL is written in pure Common Lisp and so it will run in Common Lisp
on any platform. The emphasis in writing IDEAL has been on code
clarity and providing high level programming abstractions. It thus is
very suitable for experimental implementations which need or extend
belief network technology.

At the highest level, IDEAL can be used as a subroutine library which
provides belief network inference and influence diagram evaluation as
a package. The code is documented in a detailed manual and so it is
also possible to work at a lower level on extensions of belief network
methods.

As a price of portability, IDEAL, unfortunately, does not come with a
graphic interface on any system except Symbolics Lisp machines. The
code however, is designed to permit a graphic interface to be layered
very easily over it.

Distribution method
-------------------
We usually distribute IDEAL as a large coded file which is mailed to
the new user along with detailed decoding instructions. This file can
be decoded using two standard utilties (uudecode and tar) on any UNIX
system. In case your mail host does not run UNIX, you can move the
coded file (as a saved mail message) to a UNIX machine and then decode
it there. The source code can then be moved to any target machine
running Common Lisp.

The manual comes as part of the distribution. A DVI version and a
Postscript version are provided. You can print whichever is convenient
for you.

We have a slightly specialized version of the distribution for Allegro
Common Lisp on a Macintosh (The specialization has basically to do
with a system utility for loading IDEAL, there is no added or
decreased functionality as compared to the general distribution). If
you would like the Mac distribution, let us know.  Once again, we
usually distribute the Mac version as a coded file that is mailed to
you. The file is meant to be saved, moved to a Mac, and then decoded.
If your Macintosh is not networked then we can send you floppy disks,
but that usually will take some time.

How to obtain the IDEAL distribution
----------------------------------
If you would like us to mail you the IDEAL distribution please let us
know whether you would like the general distribution or the Macintosh
Allegro CL distribution. 

In addition, for administrative purposes, please also send us an email
message where you say you will use IDEAL only for 'research
(non-commercial) purposes'.
