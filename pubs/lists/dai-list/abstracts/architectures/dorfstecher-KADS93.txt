Abstract knowledge acquisition often proves to be a major hurdle in
development of expert systems for complex, multidomain problems.  First
and foremost, this is due to the high degree of abstraction that is
needed to get from the experts' world to a representation used by
established modelling methods.  Therefore, the Strategy-Oriented
Modelling (SOM) was developed.  It should be used before more formal
methods are applied, as e.g. KADS.  SOM emphasises the modelling of the
experts' experience, i.e., their strategy, which can be seen in their
way of proceeding.  Supported by discussions with the experts, the
strategy for the system to be developed is acquired, dividing the
experts' proceeding into single working-steps and finding the optimal
order of working-steps for problem solving.  After that, each
working-step can be modelled in detail.  The division into working-steps
is needed for two reasons.  First, it becomes easier to survey and
discuss complex problems.  Second, the future development of the system
using DAI techniques is prepared.  Finding the optimal order of
working-steps is needed to make clear what basics can be expected from
every step's work and what results are needed for the next step.
Besides that, the working-steps' order is a good hint at the future
system's communication concepts to be developed later.
