ABSTRACT:   AI planning research has historically operated in formal
abstractions of the real world.  This approach was useful in discovering
many fundamental issues underlying planning; also, problems in simple
domains such as the blocks world can turn out to be surprisingly
difficult.  Lately attention has turned to planning for more realistic
domains in which micro-world simplifying assumptions do not hold.  This
shift of focus introduces a new problem of validation and comparison of
different planning theories and systems.  A proper domain for planning
problems must be realistically complex but also simple enough to support
controlled experimentation.

To address these questions, we developed the ARS MAGNA robot simulator.
The simulator provides an abstract world in which a planner controls a
mobile robot.  Mobile robotics is a particularly apposite domain since
it is a major application area for AI planning techniques.  ARS MAGNA's
environment and robot models are based on current robotics research, so
that the domain is reasonably realistic.  At the same time, we
abstracted away from many (though not all) real-world details of
kinematics and motor control.  Experiments may be controlled by varying
global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
specific environments in order to exercise particular planner features.
The world is also extensible to allow new experimental designs that were
not thought of originally.  The simulator also includes a simple
graphical user-interface which uses the CLX interface to the X window
system.

Version 1.0 of the ARS MAGNA simulator is documented in Yale Technical

As a PhD student of economics at the European University Institute in
Florence (Italy), finishing a thesis on 'Decentralized Trade', I am
interested in getting contact with people who are working on the
following topic: DECENTRALIZED TRADE WITH ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT
AGENTS.  Basic characteristic of decentralized economies is that each
individual agent has a very limited knowledge of his relevant
environment. Each agent acts and observes his outcomes in the market
(which depend on the actions of the other participants). Thus, each
individual agents learns independently, using only a success measure of
his own actual performance (e.g., profits, utility).

At the moment I am applying Classifier Systems and Genetic Algorithms to
model the learning process of each individual agent, but (given the
mentioned inherent problem of misspecification in decentralized
economies) Neural Networks seem very promising. However, application of
Neural Networks appears more complex, as in a decentralized economy
nobody would be able to tell each agent what his "target" or "correct"
decision would have been. Therefore, the machines have to learn
unsupervised (as in e.g., Barto, Sutton & Anderson (1983): Neuronlike
Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problems.
IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 13).  Hence, the
topic I am interested in might be restated as: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BY
INTERACTING MACHINES.

             TouringMachines: An Architecture for Dynamic,
		       Rational, Mobile Agents

			      Abstract

The computer-controlled operating environments at such facilities as
automated factories, nuclear power plants, telecommunications centres,
and space stations are continually becoming more complex. As this
complexity grows, it will be increasingly difficult to control such
environments with centralised management and scheduling policies that
are both robust in the face of unexpected events and flexible at dealing
with operational and environmental changes that might occur over time.
One solution to this problem which has growing appeal is to distribute
control of such operations to a number of intelligent, task-achieving
computational agents.

Real-world domains are likely to be populated by multiple agents.  In
such domains agents will typically perform a number of complex tasks
requiring some degree of attention to be paid to environmental change,
temporal constraints, computational resource bounds, and the impact the
agents' shorter term actions might have on their longer term goals.
Operating in the real world means having to deal with unexpected events
at several levels of granularity --- both in time and space.  While
agents must remain reactive in order to survive, some amount of
strategic and predictive decision making will be required if agents are
to coordinate their actions with other agents and handle complex tasks
in an effective manner.

This dissertation presents a new integrated agent architecture, designed
to provide rational, autonomous, mobile agents with the diverse range of
behaviours normally required to carry out complex, resource-constrained
tasks in dynamic, real-time, multiagent domains.  Upon surveying a
collection of existing architectures and after due consideration of the
requirements for producing effective, robust, and flexible behaviours in
a particular class of such domains, the resulting software control
architecture --- the TouringMachine agent architecture --- has been
designed through integrating a number of deliberative and
nondeliberative control functions.  Arranged in a layered fashion, the
combination of these functions endows agents with a rich collection of
reactive, goal-oriented, reflective, and predictive capabilities.

In recognition of the complex relationship which exists between an
agent's internal configuration, its task environment, and its ensuing
behavioural repertoire, the agent architecture has been implemented in
conjunction with a feature-rich, instrumented simulation testbed.  The
testbed, which permits the creation of a diverse set of single- and
multiple-agent navigation task scenarios, has been used to evaluate the
utility of the architecture and to identify some of its main strengths
and weaknesses.
