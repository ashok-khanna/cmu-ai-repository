THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
ANNOUNCES ITS SECOND CONFERENCE (Second ISDSS-Conference)
   EXPLORING THE NEXT GENERATION OF DECISION SUPPORT
                    June 22-25, 1992
                      Ulm, Germany

ISDSS, the International Society for Decision Support Systems, will have
its second conference in Ulm, Germany, June, 22-25, 1992.  The ISDSS
conference provides a forum for the international community of DSS
researchers and practioners to share ideas, insights, and observations
about the frontiers of the DSS field. It is intended to promote the next
wave of advances in the field through informative, stimulative, and
evocative interchanges among participants.  The conference includes
overview lectures on trends in DSS, presentations of DSS researcher
papers, panel discussions, and system demonstrations.  There is a
registration cap of 90 participants.

Registration fee for ISDSS member is DM 300,-, others DM 400,-. The fee
includes local transportation, refreshments, meals, and social program.

The conference will put particular emphasis on the following areas:
IDSS Foundations (e.g., concepts, architectures)
IDSS Development (e.g., tools, methods)
IDSS Usage and Evaluation (e.g., effects, metrics)
IDSS Applications (e.g., system features, experiences)

Unpublished papers are invited in the areas listed above.  For this
conference, theoretical, empirical, and applied research will be
considered. Especially sought is work concerned with modeling and solver
integration, multiparticipant decision support, distributed/parallel
decision environments, DSS quality assessment, artificially intelligent
DSS, and multidisciplinary approaches to decision support.

A three-page synopsis of the research paper should be submitted by
November 30, 1991.  The submission should identify in which of the four
areas the paper fits. The synopsis will be refereed as a basis for the
organizing committee's decision about whether to invite a presentation
based on the paper. Notification of acceptance will occur by February
15, 1992. To be included in the ISDSS Conference Proceedings, the
complete version of the accepted paper, incorporating feedback from the
conference, should be received by August 31, 1992. The organizing
committee will subsequently edit a special issue of Decision Support
Systems composed of selected, fully-refereed papers from the ISDSS
conference.
