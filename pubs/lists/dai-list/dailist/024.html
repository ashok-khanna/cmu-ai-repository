AAAI Fall Symposium 

November 14-17, 1991

KNOWLEDGE AND ACTION AT SOCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS

Research on representing and reasoning about knowledge and action at
analytical levels more aggregated than that of the individual---topics
such as social and organizational foundations of knowledge,
multiple-perspective reasoning, consensus, multiple rationality,
coordination and collaboration, commitment, stable organization,
representing groups and group activity, etc.---is becoming increasingly
important.  Such research influences many fields, including cognitive
science, distributed systems, design, human-computer interaction,
natural language processing, computer-supported cooperative work, basic
AI and distributed AI, social studies of science, and the engineering of
AI systems.  This symposium will address a number of relevant
foundational scientific issues, such as:

CONCEPTUAL MODELING: How can agents, knowledge, commitment, etc. be
modeled at the social, the individual, and at integrated levels? Can a
group be a locus of knowing, rather than an individual?  How can groups
model their own activities and influence other groups, even in so-called
"open systems?"

INTEGRATING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES: How do actors reason among multiple
representations?  How can actors deal with conflict in knowledge and
action?  How can actors dynamically construct useful meanings for the
objects and actions that are part of their joint activity?

INTEGRATING SITUATED AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE: How can agents and groups
address the basic tension between local, "situated" knowledge and
action, and the non-local conception of general knowledge and
action-at-a-distance?  How can an actor influence another actor, e.g.
by sending a message, without global semantics or control?

INTEGRATING SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVELS OF ANALYSIS: What would a
"middle ground" theory, that integrates both individual agency and
social structure, be like?  (How) can we make middle-ground theories
computational?

COMMON GROUNDS FOR INTERACTION: What are the foundations for mutually
compatible languages, assumptions, and other common bases for
interaction?  How is global or shared knowledge possible? How can agents
"stay out of each others' way?"

METHOD: What are appropriate research methods for addressing these
questions in principled ways? What are the roles and limitation of data
from biological, human, and social studies? What are the roles and
limitations of current formal models and theories?

Prospective participants should contact a symposium committee member for
a more detailed description of goals and issues.  Then they should
submit a 3 to 4 page description of their work, and some indication of
their relevant background. Ideally, presentations would integrate
theoretical perspectives and practical experience, addressing either the
scientific issues in some space of empirical phenomena, or engineering
concerns in applications domains.

Submissions should be sent BY ELECTRONIC MAIL to hovy@vaxa.isi.edu to
arrive by June 14 and will be promptly acknowledged.  If electronic
mail is impossible, send four paper copies, clearly marked "AAAI FALL
SYMPOSIUM" and to arrive by June 14, to:
