I'm about to write a review of existing work in the area of agent
architectures, and in particular, architectures "suitable for" mobile,
autonomous agents.  I'm aware of work done by Brooks, Maes, Kaelbling &
Rosenschein, Paul Cohen et al., Agre & Chapman, Vere, Pollack et al.,
Wood, and Georgeff et al.

Can anyone suggest any other projects (and specific references/contacts
if possible)?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Papers

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Engineering
and Information Science of Bilkent University, Ankara Turkey.  I started
working on Distributed (Cooperating) Knowledge Based Systems.  I have
read several papers on Distributed Artificial Intelligence, but could
not find any papers on cooperating knowledge based-systems.  I would be
glad if you could supply me some papers in this area.

Thanking you for your kind assistance, and hoping to hear from you soon.
