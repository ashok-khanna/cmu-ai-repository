Patrick Prosser says (Digest #53):
   What would I like to see? I think it would be nice if someone said
(in this newsgroup) "Okay, I will take the dialogue we have just had and
produce a paper." That way the dialogue is made available to others, and
we have an accepted terminology for future use.  In its own right, I
suppose, the creation of such a paper would be evidence of DAI.  That
is, the paper could be viewed from 2 perspectives.  First, a record of
the dialogue with its conclusion.  Secondly, as an example of an
existing distributed MA system within the scientific community (us, the
way we work together).
<<<<<<<

I think it is really a good suggestion.  But can you explain why you
regard this possible paper as the product of "MA system" rather than
"DPS"?  More specifically, it would be helpful if you could list some
reasons for rejecting DPS.

I am still stick to Lesser and Corkill's taxonomy. To apply it here, I
would say that we (this newsgroup) are featured as FA/C system.  Two
reasons:

-- No individual has given Farhad's question a complete and definitely
correct answer.  Actually, as you have noticed, each contribution
(message) addresses only parts of the problem from some (shared or
personal) perspective.  And no intermediate discussion can be guaranteed
completely accurate.  In fact, the answer is constructed (via discussion
and debate) gradually and incrementally as the new ideas emerge.  That
is why I call it FA rather than CA.

-- One reason we use this DAI-List is that we don't know with whom to
make discussion (another is to let the interested-in share the views).
Moreover, we (at least me) even don't know what the others may agree or
attack during the discussion.  This is control uncertainty.  Despite its
existence, we are *surprisingly* getting more clear picture to DAI
taxonomy.  How?  By the so-called (by Lesser and Corkill) iterative
coroutine interaction.  That is why I call it C rather than NA.

I think that Pat's idea of putting such a dialogue in a paper is a good
one, and AI Magazine would be a good place for it. I thought about
suggesting something like that myself but didn't want to take the
organizational responsibility.  I'd be up for contributing to such a
paper, though probably not up for taking full responsibility for
organizing it.

I thought there was quite a bit of evidence for DAI!? :-)

CLASSIFICATION OF MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS

Brigitte Laasri and I have set up a list of dimensions to classify a
multiagent system. This list completes a list initially defined by
Jaques Ferber and Malik Ghallab. It's different from the one of Keith
Decker, Vic Lesser, and their colleagues (published in DAI vol 2). It's
also different from the one published by Vic Lesser and Lee Erman in
IEEE SMC. But the three evaluations can be complementary. In our
opinion, one can classify a multiagent system according to the following
dimensions:

1. The number of agents: how many are they? about ten, hundred,
thousand, etc.

2. The granularity (or the degree of contribution) of the agents: How
complex and sophisticated are they? are they rational? on what
architecture are they based? At first glance, one may believe that the
granularity of the agents is always inversely proportional to their
number. This is not always the case. Imagine a worldwide
telecommunication management system. It's obvious that the latter will
be composed of many sophisticated agents.

3. The communication medium: Do they share data through a common
database? Do they have common knowledge? Do they send to each other
messages? Do they use telecommunication mediums that may induce delays,
loss of messages, etc? What type of information do they exchange? data,
goals, plans, knowledge?

4. Control: is control centralized? distributed? totally distributed?
Who coordinates whom/what?

5. Knowledge about the global problem and about the others: Does an
agent know what he/she's doing? for what? for whom? Does an agent know
about the existence, the competence, the intentions of the other agents?
Does an agent model the others?

Following these dimensions, we classified six types of agents: at one
extreme, one can find neural networks and rules (Yes, neurones and rules
cooperate but they don't know it!) followed by actors and blackboard
knowledge sources, and finally cooperative distributed problem solving
systems and mobile (autonomous) robots with perception and external
action mechanisms.

Here is the table summarizing our intermediate results.  Of course, this
table provides only (a first) qualitative comparison of multiagent
systems and it's still evolving.  So all remarks are welcome.

Subject: Multiagent Collaborative Design

Dear Sirs,

I am studying for a Ph.D. at the design computing unit of the University
of Sydney in Australia.  My research topic is on collaborative design
based on multiple agents under DAI paradigm.

Could you reply or send me papers to help my research if you have
related materials or comments?  Please use below address when you
contact me.
