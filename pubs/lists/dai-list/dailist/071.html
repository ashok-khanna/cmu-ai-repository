Stefan Kirn and I would like to announce the following GWAI'92 Workshop,
of potential interest to the DAI, CSCW, and HCI communities.

       Supporting Collaborative Work Between Human Experts and
	     Intelligent Cooperative Information Systems

Future generations of information processing systems will involve large
numbers of "agents" with significant intelligence being distributed over
large computer / communications networks.  In such environments, tasks
will be defined by one or more agents, and will be executed by groups of
problem solvers acting autonomously, cooperatively, or collaboratively,
depending upon the requirements of the problem under consideration.
This perspective includes a need to efficiently and transparently use
all computing resources (e.g., processing, knowledge, and data) that are
available over a network.  We call these systems "Intelligent
Cooperative Information Systems" (ICIS).

Much research is already being conducted in the fields of Distributed /
Federated Databases, Artificial Intelligence, and Distributed AI on the
one hand, and in the areas of Office Information Systems, Distributed
Decision Support, and CSCW on the other.  However, with regard to
collaboration between human experts and ICISs, some important
shortcomings must be recognized.  We still lack the capabilities to
effectively support human experts working together with ICISs.  We do
not even clearly know what the requirements are, in order to support
interaction of experts with ICISs!  Relevant topics of interest in these
considerations are:

- Explanation facilities helping humans understand network-wide
  processes of cooperative problem solving

- Tools and techniques enabling users to "discover" useful knowledge
  provided by remote knowledge based systems

- Facilities reducing the restrictions arising from the a priori
  autonomy (e.g., in design and implementation) of the agents being 
  integrated in an ICIS

- Coordination mechanisms discovering / avoiding harmful 
  interdependencies between the interactions among different (a priori
  independent) ICIS users or between a user-ICIS dialog and the 
  ICIS-internal cooperative problem solving

- Architectures of (intelligent) human-computer-interfaces to ICIS

On the other hand, investigations are required into limitations that
the special characteristics of ICIS impose upon user-ICIS
collaboration.  Some important topics in this area are:

- Possibilities / limitations of distributed knowledge base updates 

- Control of user access to (parts of) knowledge bases (access 
  rights, concurrency control, etc.)

- Interfaces to knowledge bases providing remote users / other
  software agents with facilities for evaluating the contents of the
  local knowledge base (independent from the standard interface to the
  local system)

- Handling / scheduling of a user's dialog with remote knowledge 
  based systems made necessary by the interactive style of 
  problem solving used by an agent working on the user's request

We would like to address the above mentioned issues in a workshop to
take place as part of the "German Workshop on AI'92" (GWAI'92), to be
held from August 31 - September 4, 1992, in Bonn, Germany.  Participants
of the workshop will present current research work in the relevant
areas.  Further, during the workshop we would like the participants to
target a specific problem (to be circulated preceding the workshop) and
analyse it with regard to a view towards its solutions.  The results of
the workshop will then be made available to the AI, HCI, and CSCW
communities.

Participation in the workshop will be by invitation (based on submission
of papers to the program committee).  Pre-proceedings will be available
at the workshop.  Depending on the quality of submissions, a subsequent
book publication is intended.

Unpublished full papers (up to 5000 words / 10 pages) are invited that
address the topics listed above (related subjects may be addressed as
well).  Theoretical, empirical and applied research will be considered.

Papers are to be submitted by June 15th, 1992 (email preferred).  Each
paper will be considered by at least two referees.  Notification of
acceptance will occur by July, 15th. To be included in the
pre-proceedings, the final version (incorporating reviewer feedback)
should be received by August 15th, 1992.  The workshop will take place
as part of GWAI'92 from August 31 - September 4, 1992 in Bonn, Germany.

Submissions of papers as well as any further communications should be
directed to the contact person, Dr. Stefan Kirn, at

Subject: WORKSHOP NOTICE...

                 TIMS College on Organizations is sponsoring a
                 Workshop on Mathematical Organization Theory
                             April 25-26, 1992
                       Marriott Orlando World Center

PURPOSE
You are invited to participate in the Workshop on Mathematical
Organization Theory. The purpose is twofold: first, to present the
latest developments in both mathematical and computational organization
theory, and second, to critique the contribution of mathematical and
computational models to organization theory and explore its future.
 
RATIONALE
A fundamental perspective for the multiperson organization has been
characterized on the principles of bounded rationality and satisficing.
Recent advances in cognitive science, for example, have provided us with
richer and more precise models of intelligent agents.  Organizational
theorists now have the opportunity to combine these models with more
traditional models of organizations to address such issues as
coordination, negotiation, organizational design, organizational
communication, and organizational learning.  The purpose of the workshop
is to explore these opportunities.  Focal topics for discussion at this
workshop include:
 
~ models of organizational design
~ models of situated/social cognition
~ extra-cognitive issues (e.g., emotion, power)
~ coordination theory
~ models of organizational learning/unlearning
~ cognitive-social networks
~ cognitive models of organizations
~ distributed artificial intelligence 

ARRANGEMENTS 
The Workshop will be held on Saturday (April 25, 1992) from 8:30am to
6pm, and on Sunday (April 26, 1992) from 8:30am to 1pm at the Marriott
Orlando World Center (1-800-228-9290). Coffee and a continental
breakfast will be served on both days.
 
REGISTRATION
The registration fee for the Workshop is $60.00. To register, please use
the registration form for the TIMS/ORSA meeting in Orlando. The form
will be published in the OR/MS TODAY and in the meeting bulletin.
Payment for the Workshop should be included with your registration fee
for the joint national meeting.
 
In order to prepare a description of participants' interests, please
submit a 1-2 page abstract (e-mail preferred) of your research by April
1, 1992 to one of the Workshop organizers:

                  lems of exchanging (domain related)  knowledge
                  between  agents  arise. To what extent  can  a
                  general  common  knowledge  representation  be
                  defined and are the ongoing activities  (e.g.,
                  KIF)  broad  enough  to  cope  with  real-life
                  problems.
                  Apart  from exchanging knowledge, the need  to
                  access domain information across the community
                  exists.  In a heterogeneous MAS one will  find
                  quite  different databases.  How can these  be

                  Human  interaction  in multiagent systems  can
                  be quite different compared to single systems:
                  the user can also be seen as an agent  working
                  cooperatively  with  the  others.  Despite  of
                  this,  the  user may still  want  to  maintain
                  supervisory functions, as for example  inspec-
                  tion of domain data within specific agents  or
                  overriding decisions made by agents. What  are
                  the latest developments in this area and  what
                  progress has been made.
