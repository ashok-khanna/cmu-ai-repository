"What would I like to see? I think it would be nice if someone said (in
this newsgroup) `Okay, I will take the dialogue we have just had and
produce a paper.'  That way the dialogue is made available to others,
and we have an accepted terminology for future use.  In its own right, I
suppose, the creation of such a paper would be evidence of DAI.  That
is, the paper could be viewed from 2 perspectives.  First, a record of
the dialogue with its conclusion.  Secondly, as an example of an
existing distributed MA system within the scientific community (us, the
way we work together)."

I would certainly welcome such a paper (well written, of course) for
publication in AI Magazine.  Also, regarding terminology, if someone
would like an on-line copy of the Waltz taxonomy of AI that appeared in
AI Magazine (Vol.  6, No. 1, Spring 1985), let me know.  It definitely
needs updating.  There's essentially nothing about DAI in that taxonomy.
