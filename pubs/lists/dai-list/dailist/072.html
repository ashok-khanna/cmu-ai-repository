DAI-List Digest #69 contained a proposed standard protocol for
interagent communication.  Such a standard could lead to wider sharing
of encoded knowledge and meaningful agent interactions across research
groups.  It could free you from worry about *how* agents communicate so
you could concentrate on *what* they communicate.  But a standard could
also be cumbersome, and stifle your research by restricting the types of
interactions your agents could have.  Because of funding from DARPA, it
is likely that a protocol will be adopted, but the details of the
protocol are not yet fixed.

Please evaluate the proposed protocol.  Here are some suggested
criteria:
1.  Does it suport the constructs your agents need to communicate?  If
for example you use a contract net, multistage negotiation, etc., would
it support these?

2.  Would the amount of overhead it entails be acceptable for your
agents and their applications?

3.  Do you need an explicit multicast mechanism?

4.  Would you need better constructs for maintaining dialogs?

5.  Would it support competitive as well as cooperative versions of your
agents?

6.  If you use inexact reasoning, can it express this inexactness?

7.  If your agents represent attitudes (a relationship between an agent
and a proposition, such as "believes," "desires," "intends," "knows,"),
can they be communicated?

8.  KQML is speech-act based.  Would you need to extend the speech acts
provided?

Thanks.

I'm looking for information about freely available distributed AI
related languages (distributed object-oriented languages in particular).
By freely, I don't necessarily mean Free, although that would be nice.
The sort of languages I have in mind are ones like ETHER, PLASMA,
ACT[1-3], ABCL/1, ACTORS, MACE, ORIENT84/K, OIL, VULCAN, etc.

If you have any information about the availability of any of these (or
any other similar language), then please let me know.

      MICE version 2.0 is now available via anonymous ftp!!!

WHAT IS MICE?

The Michigan Intelligent Coordination Experiment (MICE) testbed is used
for empirically studying and evaluating coordination knowledge and
techniques.  MICE differs from previous generic DAI testbeds because of
the minimal assumptions it makes about how agents are implemented.  For
example, the MACE \cite{Gasser87:MACE} testbed provides a language for
defining both agents and their environments, and provides many
facilities for monitoring, error handling, and interacting with the
user.  This language simplifies the task of defining new types of
agents, but also limits the agents that can be built and evaluated to
those that are specifiable in the MACE language.  In contrast, the MICE
testbed provides facilities for describing only the environment in which
agents act and interact, leaving the user with the flexibility to
implement agents in any way desired (so long as they can interface with
Lisp).  The increased latitude in how MICE agents can be implemented
places a greater burden on the agents' developers, but allows
experimentation with widely different architectures, including
blackboard systems \cite{Erman80:Hearsay-II} and Soar
\cite{Laird87:SOAR}.

MICE extends the ICE testbed developed at the University of Southern
California \cite{Gasser88:Representing} in which artificially
intelligent agents interact on a two-dimensional grid
\cite{Benda85:Optimal,Franklin87:Elements}.  MICE retains this
two-dimensional grid model of the world and adds a number of extensions
that allow greater flexibility in the coordination issues that can be
presented to the agents.  MICE provides an environment where agents
``live,'' and imposes constraints on the capabilities and actions of
agents and on the interactions between agents.  These constraints affect
the mobility of agents; the range, accuracy, and time needs of their
sensors; their ability to move, create or remove other agents; their
ability to communicate with each other; and how collisions or other
spatial relationships affect agents.

HOW DO I GET MICE?

Through anonymous ftp on the host freebie.engin.umich.edu.
Specifically, with the commands:
	$ ftp -i freebie.engin.umich.edu
	ftp> binary
	ftp> cd pub/Mice
 	ftp> mget Mice_README Mice.tar.Z
	ftp> quit

Read the Mice_README file for installation instructions.
      
WHAT ABOUT DOCUMENTATION?

MICE documentation is provided in the MICE manual, which is in Latex and
PostScript form in this directory (miceman.tex and miceman.ps).  If you
need a hardcopy of this manual because you cannot generate Latex
documents or cannot print PostScript files at your site, let us know.

WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

If you use this software, please let us know so that we can keep you
abreast of changes, bug fixes, etc.  If you have anything to report,
feel free.  Hope you enjoy MICE!
