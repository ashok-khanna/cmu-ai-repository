Title: A Distributed Problem-Solving Approach to Inductive Learning

Abstract: In this paper we propose a distributed approach to the
inductive learning problem and present an implementation of the
Distributed Learning System (DLS).  Our method involves breaking up the
data set into different sub-samples, using an inductive learning program
for each sample, and finally synthesizing the results given by each
program into a final concept by using a genetic algorithm.  We show that
such an approach gives significantly better results than using the whole
data set on an inductive learning program.  The generality of this
approach is suggested by the variety of domains in which DLS was applied
with good results, including chemical process control, bankruptcy
prediction, default loan evaluation, and loan risk classification.  We
then show how DLS can be generalized to incorporate any learning
algorithm and present some of the implications of this approach to
distributed AI systems in general and learning methodologies in
particular.  Complexity analysis further shows that the time complexity
of DLS can be made linear with respect to the size of the problem (data
set) irrespective of the time complexity of the learning algorithm it
uses.
