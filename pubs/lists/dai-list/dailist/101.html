                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
            THE AAAI-93 WORKSHOP ON AI IN COLLABORATIVE DESIGN

Design is recognized as being among the most complex of the intelligent
human endeavors. AI in design has helped to develop renewed interest in
design research and design computing by providing a symbolic approach to
modeling complex recognition and decision making. Until recently, most
AI in design research considered design as an activity carried out by a
single person and provided support tools for the individual. Design,
today, is rarely carried out by an individual working alone, but by
individuals or groups working collaboratively. AI addresses models of
problem solving for both individual and multiagent activities, and
consequently has the potential to shape this developing field.

This workshop is of particular interest at this time because there is an
increasing focus on the use of AI in design environments but a lack of
comprehensive models for collaborative design. AI provides
representation and reasoning paradigms which have extended the use of
computers in design beyond graphical CAD and numerical analysis towards
knowledge-based systems. Current developments in collaborative design
focus on communication among individuals or processes across multiple
domains, where collaboration can occur among homogeneous or
heterogeneous design views. Where AI-based design process models address
an individual's multiple views, AI-based collaborative design must focus
on merging and communication multiple views across multiple individuals.

The organizers of this workshop provide two distinct perspectives on the
topic of AI in collaborative design. One perspective is to view it as an
AI problem, the other is to view it as a design problem. This workshop
will bring together AI researchers and professionals interested in
design problem solving and design researchers and professionals who use
AI techniques.

Objectives:
   The main objectives of this workshop are to provide a forum for
researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence in
collaborative design, to discuss state-of-the-art experimental research,
and to set a new agenda for future research and development in the
field.

The workshop will focus on the following issues:
* DAI in collaborative design
* languages for communication and cooperation
* representation and communication of design intent
* intelligent user interfaces for groupwork
* intelligent synchronous multimedia interaction
* models for developing groupware
* symbolic approaches to visual reasoning
* recognition of emergence of new properties

Format of the Workshop:
   The workshop is designed to have a round-table format. Up to four
presentations selected from the submitted papers will be given. The
presentations will act as catalysts for discussion.

Attendance at the workshop will be restricted to people who submit
papers. The number of attendees will be limited.

Submission Details:
   Four copies of either full papers (maximum 20 pages) or extended
abstracts (approximately 5 pages) should be sent either electronically

Subject: CFP - IJISAFM Special Issue

The International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance
and Management (IJISAFM) is a refereed journal published by John Wiley.
A special issue on "Mathematical and Computational Models of
Organizations: Models and Characteristics of Agent Behavior," is being
co-edited by Professors Kathleen Carley
(Kathleen.Carley@centro.cs.cmu.edu -- Social and Decision Sciences,
Carnegie Mellon University), Les Gasser (Gasser@morue.usc.edu --
University of Southern California), Daniel O'Leary
(oleary@mizar.usc.edu -- School of Business, University of Southern
California), and Michael Prietula (mp2j@andrew.cmu.edu -- Carnegie
Mellon University, Graduate School of Industrial Administration).
Questions regarding the issue can be directed to any of the co-editors.

The focus of papers can be on any aspect of mathematical and computational
models of organizations, with particular interest in multiple agent models.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
1. Under what conditions does an organization exhibit
learning/intelligence greater than the sum of its agents.

2. How does organization theory relate to mathematical and computational
models of organizations?

3. How sophisticated do our models of intelligent agents need to be to
generate realistic organizational results.

4. What does organization theory gain by using more sophisticated models
of intelligent agents?

5. How should different types of agents be organized?

6. What is the impact on organizational behavior of different types of
negotiation strategies among agents?

7. What is the empirical behavior of mathematical approaches?

A broad base of research approaches are appropriate for consideration.

As with all papers for the journal, four copies should be submitted to

                             AAAI-93 Workshop on
                            Modeling in the Large
                               July 11-12, 1993
                            Call for Participation

This workshop will seek to bring together three diverse groups of people
with the explicit goal of developing shared methodologies for building
and using large expressive models.

1. There are practitioners in industry who are attempting to build
models of large, complex and evolving systems. Traditional industry
practice emphasizes disciplined approaches, formal development
methodologies, and stepwise validation in the development process. This
practice is often realized by the user of "simpler" model
representations such as, E-R, IDEF, Data Flow or OO.

2. There are AI practitioners who define and use rich representational
frameworks. Since the work pushes the state-of-the-art, AI models are
small and focused on particular aspects of what needs to be modeled.
Recently, however, some attempts have been made to build models in the
large using richer representations.

3. Those with experience in knowledge engineering methods tend to focus
on methodologies of acquiring and validating knowledge.  Such methods
tend to be task-specific and domain-focused. Here too, the issue of
scaling up to large, complex and evolving models begun to emerge.

This workshop follows closely two successful workshops: 1991 AAAI
Workshop on AI in Enterprise Integration and the First Annual Conference
on EI Modeling Technology (ICEIMT).  The proposed workshop will attempt
to focus on blending the practical experience base of enterprise
modelers with richer methods of knowledge representation and knowledge
acquisition for a fertile interchange of information.

Models in the large typically tend to be  

o Enterprise Model- i.e. how an enterprise is organized, how it
functions, including material flow, information flow, financial flow,
decision making and goal setting etc..  An Enterprise Model could be
that of an "as-is" enterprise or a "to-be" one.  The term "enterprise"
in this context applies to an organization that conducts business by
providing products or services; hence it could be a company, university,
department, division, partnership or whatever.

o Models for supporting concurrent design and engineering. 

o Design knowledge capture in large projects (e.g., the NASA Space
Station program.)

Models that have been attempted vary in richness from data models,
information flow models to full semantic or logic models.  The richness
of models determines the multitude of uses to which a model can be put.
Hence the development of semantically rich models that permit reasoning
over the model structure and contents are of great interest and
importance now.  AI, knowledge representation, and knowledge engineering
methods have much to contribute to this effort.

Topics considered include:

ENTERPRISE MODELING
Formalism easy to learn, teach, and use
Methods for dealing with scale up
Dealing with consensus reality
Dealing with how organization changes while modeling is in progress
Learning and adaptation in organizations
Open system hypothesis
Capturing Mission, Strategies, Goals and Plans
Reasoning about Policies and Procedures
Performance indicators at unit and aggregate levels
Product & Process integration
Concurrent Design and Engineering
Business Process Re-engineering
Business process simulation
Justification of expense and effort of modeling to executive management

	MODEL REPRESENTATION
	Frame, logic-based, and Description logics
	Semantics of key constructs like part/wholes, flows and teleology
	Actor systems
	DAI techniques, including negotiation
	Reasoning Methods: formal and heuristic
	Three Schema view
	-Use of separate representation for communication with content
	 experts, discussion among modelers, and computer representation
	Relation to Object Oriented Models, Semantic Data Models, etc.

		KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING METHODOLOGIES
		Knowledge Engineering
		-Sources of models: interviews, manuals, observations
		-Modeling "consensus reality"
		-Model integration and validation
		-Model consistency checking
		-How to tailor the "purpose" of modeling into the
		 "methods" of modeling
		Information Engineering Methodology
		-Expansion of this to technical domains
		-OO extensions to IE
		Relation to OOA/OOD/OBA/SADT etc.

Significance: In the corporate computing circles the topic of Enterprise
Integration and Enterprise Modeling are of great interest and multiple
million dollar efforts are beginning.  However, the formalisms chosen
for many of the modeling methods utilize simple data flow graphs and
hierarchical system views of the world. Knowledge representation and
Knowledge engineering techniques of the past 25 years have much to
contribute to these efforts. Yet, no discipline and methodology appears
to be emerging from the AI efforts. It appears timely to capitalize on a
wonderful opportunity to target AI techniques in the service of
Enterprise Modeling.

Format: The workshop is planned for a day and a half with presentations
of papers and invited talks, open discussions and 2 panels. Several
"joint" presentations will be given in intersection areas.  About 40
people are expected to be invited.  All participants will be selected
based on expected contributions to the cross-fertilization among several
topics, rather than strength or experience in one topic.

Submission requirements:  Interested participants should send in a
position paper of 4 to 5 pages by electronic mail (preferred) or
hardcopy.  This should cover thoughts on important and interesting areas
of concern for "Modeling in the Large" with particular emphasis on
disciplined methodologies.  A brief statement of relevant background or
experience of the author should be included.

Papers should be received by the workshop chair by March 12 1993.  
Notification of acceptance will by on April 2.  
Camera-ready copies are required by April 30.

SCHEMAS AND NEURAL NETWORKS:  
INTEGRATING SYMBOLIC AND SUBSYMBOLIC APPROACHES TO
COOPERATIVE COMPUTATION 

A workshop sponsored by the 
Center for Neural Engineering
University of Southern California
Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520

April 13th and 14th, 1993

Program Committee: Michael Arbib (Organizer), John Barnden, George
Bekey, Francisco Cervantes-Perez, Damian Lyons, Paul Rosenbloom, Ron
Sun, Akinori Yonezawa

To design complex technological systems and to analyze complex
biological and cognitive systems, we need a multilevel methodology that
combines a coarse-grain analysis of cooperative or distributed
computation (we shall refer to the computing agents at this level as
"schemas") with a fine-grain model of flexible, adaptive computation
(for which neural networks provide a powerful general paradigm).
Schemas provide a language for distributed artificial intelligence,
perceptual robotics, cognitive modeling, and brain theory which is "in
the style of the brain", but at a relatively high level of abstraction
relative to neural networks.

The proposed workshop will provide a 2-hour introductory tutorial and
problem statement by Michael Arbib, and sessions in which an invited
paper will be followed by several contributed papers, selected from
those submitted in response to this call for papers.  Preference will
be given to papers which present practical examples of, theory of,
and/or methodology for the design and analysis of complex systems in
which the overall specification or analysis is conducted in terms of
schemas, and where some but not necessarily all of the schemas are
implemented in neural networks.

A list of sample topics for contributions follows, where a hybrid
approach means one in which the abstract schema level is integrated
with neural or other lower level models:
	Schema Theory as a description language for 	
	neural networks
	Modular neural networks
	Linking DAI to Neural Networks to Hybrid 
	Architecture
	Formal Theories of Schemas
	Hybrid approaches to integrating planning & 
	reaction
	Hybrid approaches to learning 
	Hybrid approaches to commonsense reasoning by 
	integrating neural networks and rule-	
	based reasoning (using schema for the 
	integration)
	Programming Languages for Schemas and Neural 
	Networks
	Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming for 
	Distributed AI and Neural Networks
	Schema Theory Applied in Cognitive Psychology, 
	Linguistics, Robotics, AI and Neuroscience

Prospective contributors should send a hard copy of a five-page
extended abstract, including figures with informative captions and full
references (either by regular mail or fax) by February 15, 1993 to
Michael Arbib, Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-2520, USA [Tel: (213) 740-9220, Fax:
(213) 746-2863, arbib@pollux.usc.edu].  Please include your full
address, including fax and email, on the paper.

Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent by email no later
than March 1, 1993.  There are currently no plans to issue a formal
proceedings of full papers, but revised versions of accepted abstracts
received prior to April 1, 1993 will be collected with the full text of
the Tutorial in a CNE Technical Report which will be made available to
registrants at the start of the meeting.  [A useful way to structure
such an abstract is in short numbered sections, where each section
presents (in a small type face!) the material corresponding to one
transparency/slide in a verbal presentation.  This will make it easy
for an audience to take notes if they have a copy of the abstract at
your presentation.]

                            Call for Papers
                    Dynamically Interacting Robots

                           IJCAI-93 Workshop
                           Chambery,  France
                      August 28, 29, or 30, 1993

This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the
issues and challenges in controlling multiple interacting robots.  Our
goal is to illuminate issues in dynamic situated agency arising from the
interaction of multiple agents.  The technology for experimentation with
robot societies is rapidly becoming available; the workshop provides an
opportunity to identify key issues, vocabulary, and directions for
future research.

The focus of the workshop is experimental work.  We hope to assess
theories for controlling multiple interacting robots, and to share
experiences in implementing robot societies.  The dynamics inherent in
multirobot domains, coupled with the opportunities for reasoning about
the possible actions of other robots, leads to new theories for control
and planning in multiple robot systems.  We welcome perspectives for
controlling robot societies at the individual and group level.  The
robot societies may be engaged in cooperative, competitive, or
individual activities, or combinations thereof.

The workshop provides a forum for discussions of the special challenges
involved with the control of a group of robots in real-time, especially
in the context of advances made in distributed AI, theories of situated
activity, robot control, decision theoretic methods, and adaptive
behavior.  One of our aims is to identify clearly the issues involved in
robot societies, and how they might distinguish this research program
from distributed AI in general.

* Issues of Interest 

     Implemented Systems:   Descriptions of and lessons from implemented
systems.  Which issues arise from the group dynamics as opposed to
implementation concerns?

     Languages/Architectures:   What kind of languages are needed for
describing group level behavior, including group dynamics and task
description?  Can we extend existing languages such as GAPPS or the
subsumption architecture for robust control of a collection?

     Domains:   What are good and bad domains for studying interacting
robots?  What is and isn't ``cheating''?  Is central control to be
frowned on?  Does communication have to be direct, or can it be
mediated?  Is simulating some sensing and communication acceptable?

     Active Perception:   Do different sensory requirements arise in
collective robotics?  How does sensing ability influence group dynamics
and vice versa?

     Planning:   To what extent should robots that could potentially
interact plan their actions and interactions?  When is planning a
particularly good, or bad, idea?  What forms should plans take, and what
algorithms lead to those forms of plans?

     Communication:  What is the role of communication in interacting
robots?  What are appropriate forms of communication?

     Modeling:  How should robots model each other in their domain?  How
are such models constructed and used?

     Learning:  How can we exploit group dynamics and interaction in
learning?  Does cooperation or competition enhance or inhibit learning?

Those wishing to present their work should submit 5 copies of a short
paper (approximately 5 pages) as well as a one-page statement of
research interests and bibliography.  Those wishing to participate only
should submit 5 copies of a one-page research statement and
bibliography.  All submissions should include an e-mail address, a
telephone number, and a mailing address.  Prospective participants are
encouraged to contact members of the program committee with any
questions or comments.

Submissions should be sent to arrive by February 26, 1993 to:
