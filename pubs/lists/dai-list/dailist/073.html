Subject: DAI Language availability

Re: Afzal Ballim's post asking for a DAI language, MACE is no longer
available; work on it effectively ceased in the fall of 1989.  If you
are interested in a concurrent object-oriented language (simulated
concurrency) try Jean-Pierre Briot's ACTALK (Actors in Smalltalk) or
MAGENTALK (agents built on ACTALK); Jean-Pierre (briot@litp.ibp.fr) is
currently recovering from a bad accident, and not reading email, so you
can find out more about these two via Jacques Ferber
(ferber@laforia.ibp.fr) or Loic Lescaudron (loic@litp.ibp.fr).  Jacques
has a number of related projects.  You might also look into ABCL/1 (I
understand it's available via Aki Yonezawa:
yonezawa@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp) or Orient-84 and its followups (via Mario
Tokoro: mario@mt.cs.keio.ac.jp).  You might also contact Sylvain Giroux
at U. of Montreal who has done some work extending ACTALK
(giroux@iro.umontreal.ca).  And I thought the U of Geneva had KNOS etc;
have you talked with Tchiritzis' group there?

	    INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON FEATURE INTERACTIONS
		IN TELECOMMUNICATION SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

	   St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, December 3-4, 1992

			     DESCRIPTION

This workshop is planned to encourage researchers from a variety of
computer science specialties (software engineering, protocol
engineering, distributed artificial intelligence, formal techniques, and
distributed systems, among others) to apply their techniques to the
feature interaction problem that arises in building telecommunication
software systems.

The feature interaction problem has been a major obstacle to the rapid
deployment of new telephone services.  Telecommunication software is
huge, real-time, and distributed; adding new features to a
telecommunication system, like adding new functionalities to any large
software system, can be very difficult.  Each new feature may interact
with many existing features, causing customer annoyance or total system
breakdown. Traditionally, interactions were detected and resolved on a
feature by feature basis by experts who are knowledgeable on all
existing features. As the number of features grows to satisfy diverse
needs of customers, managing feature interactions in a single
administrative domain is approaching incomprehensible complexity. In a
future marketplace where features deployed in the network may be
developed by different operating companies and their associated vendors,
the traditional approach is no longer feasible. How to detect, resolve,
or even prevent the occurrence of feature interactions in an open
network becomes an important research issue.

The feature interaction problem is not unique to telecommunication
software; similar problems are encountered in any long-lived software
system that requires frequent changes and additions to its
functionality.  Techniques in many related areas appear to be applicable
to the management of feature interactions.  Software methodologies for
extensibility and compatibility, for example, could be useful for
providing a structured design that can prevent many feature interactions
from occurring.  Formal specification, verification, and testing
techniques, being widely used in protocol engineering and software
engineering, contribute a lot to the detection of interactions.  Several
causes of the problem, such as aliasing, timing, and the distribution of
software components, are similar to issues in distributed systems.
Cooperative problem solving, a promising approach for resolving
interactions at run time, resembles distributed planning and resolution
of conflicting subgoals among multiple agents in the area of distributed
artificial intelligence.  This workshop aims to provide an opportunity
for participants to share ideas and experiences in their respective
fields, and to apply their expertise to the feature interaction problem.

We welcome papers on preventing, detecting, and/or resolving feature
interactions using either analytical or structural approaches.
Submissions are encouraged in (but are not limited to) the following
topic areas:
      - Classification of feature interactions.  
      - Modeling, reasoning, and testing techniques for detecting 
        feature interactions.  
      - Software platforms and architectures for preventing or 
        resolving feature interactions.  
      - Tools and methodologies for promoting software compatibility
        and extensibility.  
      - Environments and automated tools for related problems in other 
        software systems.

				FORMAT

We hope to promote a dialogue among researchers in various related
areas, as well as the designers and builders of telecommunications
software. To this end, the workshop will have sessions for paper
presentations, including relatively long discussion periods. Panel
discussions and a short tutorial on issues in the feature interaction
problem are being organized.

			      ATTENDANCE

Workshop attendance will be limited to 75 people. Attendance will be by
invitation only.  Prospective attendees are asked to submit either a
paper (maximum 5000 words) or a single page description of their
interests and how they relate to the workshop.  About 16--20 of the
attendees will be asked to present talks.  We will strive for an equal
mix of theoretical results and practical experiences. A set of working
notes will be provided at the workshop. Papers with the highest quality
will be considered for publication in a special issue or section of a
research journal.

Please send five copies of your full original paper or interest
