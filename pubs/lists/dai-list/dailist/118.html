For your possible interest, here is a talk I have scheduled in May in
Germany:

         Design Space Navigation as a Collaborative Aid
            May 10, 10:00am, at the GMD, Bonn
            May 19, 2:00pm, at U. of Kaiserslautern
            May 24, 10:00am, at FAW, Ulm am Donau

The Redux' server is an agent, with no domain-specific knowledge, that
provides generic coordination services to distributed design systems.
The coordination is accomplished by a ``wrapper'' technique requiring
relatively little modification of existing agents, yet the Redux'
coordination services significantly extend the usual ``ask/tell'' agent
protocols.  These advantages are obtained because the server is based on
a simple and ubiquitous search-based model of design decisions.  The
Redux' services and the mapping to other agents are illustrated by
experience with FirstLink, a Stanford University system for the
distributed design of aircraft cable harnesses.

Is anyone driving from or via Cleveland to the DAI'93 Workshop in
Pittsburgh?  I need a ride and would share driving and gas costs.

A couple of papers about autonomous mobile robots are now available via
FTP:

SPIN - Learning and Forgetting Surface Classifications
       with Dynamic Neural Networks

Herman Keuchel, Ewald von Puttkamer & Uwe R. Zimmer

This paper refers to the problem of adaptability over an infinite period
of time, regarding dynamic networks. A never ending flow of examples
have to be clustered, based on a distance-measure. The developed model
is based on the self-organizing feature maps of Kohonen [6], [7] and
some adaptations by Fritzke [3]. The problem of dynamic surface
classification is embedded in the SPIN project, where sub-symbolic
abstractions, based on a 3-d scanned environment is being done.

ALBATROSS - The Communication Scheme as a Key
            to Fulfil Hard Real-Time Constraints

Ewald von Puttkamer, Christopher Wetzler & Uwe R. Zimmer

Based on experiences from an autonomous mobile robot project called
MOBOT-III, we found hard realtime-constraints for the
operating-system-design. ALBATROSS is "A flexible multitasking and
realtime network-operating-system-kernel", not limited to
mobile-robot-projects only, but which might be useful also wherever you
have to guarantee a high reliability of a realtime-system. The focus in
this article is on a communication-scheme fulfilling the demanded (hard
realtime-) assurances although not implying time- delays or jitters on
the critical information-channels.  The central chapters discuss a
locking-free shared buffer management, without the need for interrupts
and a way to arrange the communication architecture in order to produce
minimal protocol-overhead and short cycle-times.  Most of the remaining
communication-capacity (if there is any) is used for redundant
transfers, increasing the reliability of the whole system.  ALBATROSS is
implemented on a multiprocessor VMEbus-system.

Accurate Position Estimation for an Autonomous Mobile Robot
   Fusing Shaft Encoder Values and Laser Range Data

Thomas Edlinger, Rainer Trieb and Ewald von Puttkamer

This paper describes the realtime position estimation method developed
for MOBOT-III, an autonomous mobile robot for indoor!applications.
MOBOT-III is designed to operate in an unknown or partially known
environment and uses a laser!radar as the main sensor for environment
perception. For environment modelling and task execution it is essential
to determine the exact position of the vehicle within the operating
environment. A method is presented, which extracts an invariant property
of the local environment by a statistical interpretation of the raw
sensor data. This feature is stored in a global map and is used for
position verification as long as the vehicle moves within this local
environment or whenever it reenters it.

An Efficient Navigation Strategy for an Autonomous Mobile Robot

Thomas Edlinger, Ewald von Puttkamer and Thomas Strauch

This paper describes the navigation component of MOBOT-III, a
laser-radar based autonomous mobile robot for indoor applications.
MOBOT-III has no preloaded world model, but builds up an internal map,
while exploring the environment. Based on a continuously updated part of
the world model, consisting of obstacle lines, the navigation module
constructs a free space graph to find a way from the startposition to
the desired destination. A method is presented to find a suboptimal way
without creating the complete graph.

Extracting Lines, Circular Segments and Clusters from Radar Pictures
   in Real-Time for an Autonomous Mobile Robot

Thomas Knieriemen, Ewald von Puttkamer, Joerg Roth

Autonomous mobile systems have to convert their sensor data in real time
into meaningful data structures to navigate with their help through
their environment.  Here a way is shown to extract a description of the
environment from a radar picture in real time with help of a curvature
function.  The mobile systems has as its environment a bureau like
indoor environment and obstacles detected by a laser radar are described
as lines, circle segments and clusters as building blocks of maps.  The
line extracting algorithm is compared to other line fitting algorithms
and the time needed measured from a number of different scenes. The
algorithm allows to process laser radar data with 250 ms/picture.

ALBATROSS - An Operating-System under hard Realtime-Constraints

Ewald von Puttkamer & Uwe R. Zimmer

Based on the experiences from an autonomous mobile robot project called
MOBOT-III, we found hard realtime-constraints for the
operating-system-design. ALBATROSS is "A flexible multitasking and
realtime network-operating-system-kernel". The focus in this article is
on a communication-scheme fulfilling the previous demanded assurances.
The central chapters discuss the shared buffer management and the way to
design the communication architecture. Some further aspects beside the
strict realtime-requirements like the possibilities to control and watch
a running system, are mentioned.

Hello, everyone.

Has any efforts been done toward modelling human's brain by integrating
DAI and Neural Networks?  Any suggestions or comments are welcome.
