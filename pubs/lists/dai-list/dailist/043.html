The Journal of Organizational Computing is a new quarterly journal that
publishes original research articles concerned with impacts of computer
and communication technology on organizational design, operations, and
performance.  It serves as a forum for stimulating and disseminating
research into the implications of these technologies for organizational
structure and dynamics, the technological advances needed to keep pace
with organizational changes, and emerging technological possibilities
for improving organizational productivity.  The journal's focus is not
on computing as it relates to individuals.

Theoretical, experimental, and survey research are all appropriate to
the Journal of Organizational Computing.  The journal's major editorial
areas are computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), groupware,
computer modeling of organizations, investigations of organizational
systems issues such as computer-aided coordination and organizational
learning, economics of organizational computing, and behavioral studies
of organizational computing.  The refereeing of papers in each of these
areas is directed by an Associate Editor.  The journal also publishes
relevant book reviews, meeting announcements, and brief notes.
Editorial comments and invited papers on organizational computing
occasionally appear as warranted by recent developments.

A special issue based on a conference entitled "Organizational
Computing, Coordination, and Collaboration," held at IC2 Institute at
the University of Texas will launch the journal in 1991.

               Call for contributions
                 to a special issue
                  on DIGITAL JOURNALS

Be they societies, participants in a field of study, or research
departments, scientific organizations thrive on the creation and
dissemination of knowledge. Traditionally, peer review journals have
been a major means for filtering, stimulating, qualifying, and
distributing scientific knowledge. Given the growth in science,
journals, and computing technology, the issue of using that technology
to supplement conventional journals is an important one for enhancing
productivity in scientific organizations. A major focus in exploring
this issue is the conception, design, implementation, utilization, and
evaluation of digital journals: computer based means for filtering,
stimulating, qualifying, and distributing scientific knowledge.

To further the state of knowledge about digital journals, the JOURNAL
OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING is soliciting contributions to a special
issue. These contributions might address such topics as digital journal
technology (specially group technology), economic, impacts,
administration, multi-media presentation, quality control,
customization, and their relationship to collaborators.

Outlines of original manuscripts should be submitted to the editor
(Prof. Andrew B. Whinston abw@emx.utexas.edu) by January 15,1992.

All submissions should conform to the guidelines of the journal.
Electronic submissions are welcomed.
Electronic submissions could be in any of teh following formats
1 LaTex
2 Postscript Files.
3 Microsoft Word and MacWrite files (Mac only) compressed using
Stuffit on BinHex

Questions and clarifications should be addresed to
