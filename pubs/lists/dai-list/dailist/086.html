Subject: What is DAI?

This years MAAMAW contained a panel session that concentrated on the
relationship between AI and DAI.  Where we are and where we're going.
Whilst it is pertinent to ask why we are asking the question in the
first place, that may be the topic for another discussion.  For now, I'd
like to present a view that, via an analogy, hopefully presents one
aspect of the question - how is DAI related to AI?  All comments
appreciated.

I would like to propose that the relationship between DAI and AI is akin
to that between CSCW and HCI.  Both CSCW and DAI started out as
`offshoots' from their `parent' disciplines, but now both are disciplies
in their own right.  Indeed, CSCW could be seen as a superset of what
HCI has to offer or is concerned with.  The same could be said of DAI.
We consider more than the basics of AI.  Just as CSCW encompasses social
aspects, so does DAI; likewise, distribution is a main point for both
disciplines (not necessarily spatial distribution, but distribution in
terms of considering more than one actor or agent).

So what comes of this brief consideration?  DAI is a field that sprouted
from AI not long ago, but can now be considered a superset of AI - it
considers all that AI considers, but with added sociological,
psychological, and philosophical aspects, not to mention the emphasis
being placed on emergence, which is becoming almost a discipline in its
own right.

Subject: Re: DAI Olympics

On the subject of DAI Olympics, I think the DAI workshop would be an
appropriate forum to discuss proposals and event spec out the selected
idea.  To add my two bits, I think a Mars Rovers (multiple) scenario is
realistic and possible to simulate with human in the loop (high-level
control).  The "application" has sufficient room to develop interesting
situations that call for various types of cooperation and distribution.
It has the "charm" of PHOENIX.

Subject: DAI competition - another twist

Another twist on the idea is to shift DAI Competition into a DAI
Cooperation.  Why compete - since as Candy put it, there is not enough
common ground - and any new domain would mean needless effort
distracting from current focus.

In a DAI Cooperation, people focusing on different aspects of DAI,
attempt to show that their system
- assumes that there are other agents in the world
- can interact with them
- can discover some attributes of these agents
- and can modify their behavior to reflect the presence of other agents

The collective of agents is scored on how well they are able to
function.  Some of our discussion in Gloucester workshop that was
triggered by Miro are relevant on how to score and what to score.

Sorry to be a bit terse, but as time permits I shall try to elaborate.

Ah yes, each agent is working on something that forms the core of what
their own world is, the interaction with other agents is not in any
DOMAIN.

        Tutorial and Workshop on Cooperating Knowledge Based Systems
                   September 23-24, 1992, Keele University

The UK Special Interest Group on Cooperating Knowledge Based Systems
(CKBS-SIGUK) sponsored by the UK Department of Trade and Industry,
invites you to register for a tutorial and workshop to be held at Keele
University from September 23 to 24, 1992.

Tutorial [Wednesday, September 23, 2-5 p.m.]

Topic:    Multi-agent Systems
Presenter:Dr. Donald Steiner, Siemens, Germany
          Dr. Steiner worked in some large US projects before joining
          Siemens to work on multiagent systems.

Workshop [Thursday, September 24, starting at 9am]

 Topics: These are expected to include [partial list]:

   o The recently proposed DARPA (US Department of Defence) language for
     multiagent systems

   o Design issues in a CKBS approach to telecommunication diagnostics

   o Optimisation in an intelligent data-network routing system

   o Some issues in Air Traffic Control

   o Applying CKBS techniques to electronic mail

   o Knowledge consistency

A draft workshop proceedings will include drafts/handouts, as available,
of the presentations at the conference.    The full papers will be
reviewed subsequently following their presentation at the workshop, and
those selected will constitue the final workshop proceedings.  Copies of
the final proceedings will be mailed to the attendees in due course.

Background

In CKBS a number of intelligent computer systems cooperate together to
solve problems that cannot be solved otherwise.  CKBSs may be described
as the next generation of intelligent systems, with a wide range of
industrial application areas, such as air traffic control,
telecommunications network management, distributed sensor networks,
distributed monitoring and fault diagnostics, intelligent manufacturing
systemsand so on.   The focus of CKBS is applied multiagent systems
where the techniques of distributed artificial intelligence and
distributed databases blend together to provide good solutions to real
world problems.

The first international conference on this theme was the CKBS'90 held at
Keele in October 1990.  The conference was considered by the
participants to be a valuable forum for the cross fertilisation of ideas
in this area and at their suggestion a special interest group, CKBS-SIG
International, was formed (managed by the DAKE Centre at Keele), in
order to provide a nucleus for further activities in this area.   The
CKBS-SIG (UK) is a subgroup of this larger SIG.  Attendance is welcome
from members of CKBS-SIG International and also from other interested
researchers.   The activity committee of the workshop consists of:

  Prof. S.M. Deen(Keele University) [Chairman]
  Prof. J. Doran(University of Essex)
  Dr. D. Grif#ths(British Telecom)
  Dr. P. Kearney(Sharp Laboratories, Europe)
  Prof. I. Mamdani(Queen Mary and West#eld College, London)

Subject: Job Opening: RA postion at Stanford

Job Description for Post-Doctoral Research Associate:

The Concurrent Product and Process Design Project at Stanford is seeking
a post-Doctoral Research Associate to participate in and lead research
on distributed concurrent engineering environments.  The position
requires an extensive background in Artifical Intelligence applied to
engineering and design, with considerable experience in modeling,
planning, knowledge representation, and the development of large,
integrated software systems.

The successful applicant will lead the development of "SHARE", an
innovative engineering environment comprising cooperating intelligent
agents (humans and software modules) and a distributed, shared
representation of designs and processes.  He or she will help supervise
students and junior staff, and will contribute to research in the areas
of computer-mediated team design, design representation and the
application of software engineering methodologies and tools to
mechanical design.

The SHARE project is directed by Professors Larry Leifer and Mark
Cutkosky of the Center for Design Research at Stanford, in collaboration
with Dr. Jay M. Tenenbaum, President of Enterprise Integration Inc. and
Consulting Professor, C.S. Department, Stanford.
