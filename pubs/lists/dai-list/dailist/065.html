I wish to address some of Mr. Petrie's remarks [DAI-List Digest #64]
because they are erroneous.

	1) We did not run "several" agents to obtain our results, we ran
at least 100, as clearly stated in the paper.

	2) We did *not* conclude that "it is better to have simple
cooperating processes than a single task-specific program".  What we
mean is that there is often enormous effort involved in constructing
task-specific programs and for some of those tasks it may be easier to
use a collection of simpler interacting programs.  These simple
programs also need not rely on perfect information from the other
programs in order for high performance to be acheived.  Of course, if
task-specific programs are available then they should be used,
preferably in a cooperative mode to acheive even greater speed.  Our
purpose was not to show how to solve cryptarithmetic problems via
cooperation (we know task-specific algorithms exist for this problem),
but to show on a specific, familiar example how cooperation of simple
programs can be used to improve performance over non-cooperative simple
programs.

Yes and no.  I've seen more than my share of graduate students whose
"parallelism" research consists in implementing on two microcomputers an
algorithm that could best be studied on a single sheet of paper.  On the
other hand, it's a substantial contribution to *prove* statements like
	"The key difference between cooperating
	and noncooperating agents is that hints
	effectively reduce the size of the
	search space by focusing the agents on
	much more plausible courses of action.
	Moreover, an agent searching one part
	of the space may find a hint useful to
	another agent in a different part of
	the space."
or
	"Hence, with specialization the faster
	performers benefit while the slower
	performers suffer."
Some people do not believe in cooperation, in the sense that they expect
communication costs to swamp any gains due to "specialization".  I rate
it useful for Clearwater et al. to have worked out some of the true
details behind this question.

Well, OK, I believe it should; do you have a good proof of that?  I
think it would be worth publishing?

I count at least two, but note how typical they are of what happens when
editors try to slim something down to keep it "popular" (*Scientific
American* commits this incessantly).  I suspect the authors themselves
have a bit more respect for the syntax of formal parameters.

My apologies to the *Science* reviewers, if they were not the ones
responsible in this case.
