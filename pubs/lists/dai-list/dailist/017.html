Many thanks to all of you who have so kindly sent me references on
network traffic control.  I have another research group working on DAI
approaches to air-traffic control.  If any of you are working on this
area, please let me know so that we can keep in touch.  Also, let me
know if you have published anything on this recently (excluding those
publications that appeared or were referenced in Readings in DAI edited
by Bond and Gasser, DAI Vol:1 edited by Huhns, or DAI Vol:2 edited by
Gasser and Huhns).

Many thanks for your help.
