10th AAAI International Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence

                          The Flying L Ranch
                            Bandera, Texas (near San antonio)
                          October 23-27, 1990


Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with how a
decentralized group of intelligent computational agents should
coordinate their activities to achieve their goals.  When pursuing
common or overlapping goals, they should act cooperatively so as to
accomplish more as a group than individually; when pursuing conflicting
goals, they should compete intelligently.  The objective of the 10th
Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence is to assess and advance
the state of the art in coordination among intelligent agents.  The
focus will be synthetic and pragmatic, investigating how we can
integrate theoretical and experimental ideas about knowledge, planning,
negotiation, action, etc. in multiagent domains to build working
interacting agents.

Participation at the Workshop will be by invitation only and will be
limited to approximately 35 people.  To participate, please submit a
technical paper describing original research or significant applications
in DAI to the Workshop chairman.  Preference will be given to work that
addresses one or more of the six basic problem areas of DAI listed
below.  We specifically discourage the submission of papers in areas
such as fine-grained parallelism, hardware or language-level
concurrency, and connectionism, because we feel that work in these areas
is more appropriate for other workshops.  A small number of "interested
observers" may also be invited to attend.  If you would like to be
considered for attendance on this basis, please submit a written request
justifying your participation.

Papers are solicited for (but not limited to) the following six basic
DAI topics:

1.  Task decomposition:  the use of multiple interacting knowledge
bases, distributed planning, and other ways to decompose a task,
distribute it among agents, and allocate resources.

2.  Communication and interaction among agents, including communication
protocols, Speech Act theory, and reasoning about communication.

3.  Maintaining coherence during problem solving, including issues of
distributed control and organization.

4.  Modeling other agents, such as their beliefs, plans, goals, and
problem-solving capabilities, as well as the collaborative process
itself.

5.  Recognizing and resolving disparities among agents, using
negotiation, belief and justification networks, open systems, and due
process.

6.  Building and simulating agents, using object-based concurrent
programming languages such as Actors, reflective languages, frameworks
such as ABE, MACE, RAD, and SOCIAL, simulation environments such as DVMT
and MICE, and blackboard systems.

The Workshop will have several types of sessions, including presentation
sessions for discussion of distinguished papers, panel discussions for
consideration of groups of related papers, and working sessions on
topics such as communication standards for agent interactions, and
methodologies and evaluation criteria for DAI research.


DATES:

Deadline for submission of papers (3 copies, please):  July 2, 1990.

Notification of acceptance:                            August 7, 1990.

Final papers due (for distribution at the Workshop):   October 1, 1990.

We expect that revised versions of the best papers from the Workshop
will be published as "Distributed Artificial Intelligence Volume III"
and in a special issue on DAI in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and
Cybernetics.
