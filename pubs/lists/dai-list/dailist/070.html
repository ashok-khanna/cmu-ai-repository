				 CIKM-92
		    First International Conference on
		  INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
				    
     November 8 - 11, 1992  Radisson Hotel, Baltimore, Maryland, USA
				    
			    Sponsored by ISMM
	      in cooperation with AAAI, SIGART, SIGIR, IEEE
   
The conference provides an international forum for presentation and
discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well
as recent advances on data and knowledge bases.

Authors are invited to submit papers and proposals for tutorials
concerned with theory or practice or both.  The focus of the conference
includes, but is not limited to, the following: application of knowledge
representation techniques to semantic data modeling; development and
management of heterogeneous knowledge bases; automatic acquistion of
data and knowledge bases, especially from raw text; object-oriented
DBMS; optimization techniques; transaction management; high performance
OLTP systems; security techniques; performance evaluation; hypermedia;
unconventional applications; parallel database systems; physical and
logical database design; data and knowledge sharing; interchange and
interoperability; cooperation in heterogenous systems; domain modeling
and ontology building; knowledge discovery in databases; information
storage and retrieval and interface technology.

The Outbreak of Cooperation

N. Glance and B. A. Huberman

Abstract

We study the ongoing collective action problem among intentional agents
whose choices depend not only on the past but also on their expectations
as to how their actions will affect those of others.  In this model
agents act on the basis of imperfect information.  We show that under
these conditions the onset of overall cooperation can take place in a
sudden and unexpected way.  Likewise, defection can appear out of
nowhere in very large, previously cooperating groups.  These outbreaks
mark the end of long transient states in which defection or cooperation
persists in groups that cannot sustain it indefinitely.

                  Conference Announcement and Call For Papers
                          FROM ANIMALS TO ANIMATS
Second International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB92)

                              Ilikai Hotel
                   Honolulu, Hawaii, December 7-11, 1992

This conference is the successor to SAB90 - which was held in Paris in
September, 1990.  Its object is to bring together researchers in
ethology, psychology, ecology, cybernetics, artificial intelligence,
robotics, and related fields so as to further our understanding of the
behaviors and underlying mechanisms that allow animals and, potentially,
robots to adapt and survive in uncertain environments.

The conference will focus particularly on simulation models in order to
help characterize and compare various organizational principles or
architectures capable of inducing adaptive behavior in real or
artificial animals.

Contributions treating any of the following topics from the perspective
of adaptive behavior will receive special emphasis.

Individual and collective behavior   Autonomous robots
Neural correlates of behavior        Hierarchical and parallel organizations
Perception and motor control         Emergent structures and behaviors
Motivation and emotion               Problem solving and planning
Action selection and behavioral      Goal directed behavior
 sequences                           Neural networks and classifier systems
Ontogeny, learning and evolution     Characterization of environments
Internal world models                Applied adaptive behavior
 and cognitive processes

Submission Instructions

Authors are requested to send two copies (hard copy only) of a full
paper to each of the Conference co-chairs (Meyer, Roitblat, & Wilson).
Papers should not exceed 10 pages (excluding the title page), with 1
inch margins all around, and no smaller than 10 pt (12 pitch) type
(Times Roman preferred).  Each paper must include a title page
containing the following: (1) Full names, postal addresses, phone
numbers, email addresses (if available), and fax numbers for each
author, (2) A 100-200 word abstract, (3) The topic area(s) in which the
paper could be reviewed (see list above). Camera ready versions of the
papers will be required after acceptance.  Computer, video, and robotic
demonstrations are also invited.  Please contact Herbert Roitblat to
make arrangements for demonstrations.  Other program proposals will also
be considered.

Meeting Site

The conference activities will be held at the Ilikai Hotel. The Ilikai

fine restaurants, Ala Moana Shopping Center, and Ala Moana Park.  The
Hotel overlooks the Ala Wai Yacht Marina where Waikiki Beach begins.
Room rates for the conference are $110 or $125 per night (single or
double).  Most rooms have been recently remodelled and provide ocean or
city views.  The hotel is adjacent to the beach and also offers two
swimming pools, a fitness center, and tennis courts.  Reservations must
be made directly with the hotel.  Conference rates will be available for
the weekend before and the weekend following the conference as well.
Arrangements have been made for a small number of student rooms in a
nearby hotel at about $55 per night (single or double).  Students are,
of course, welcome to stay in the conference hotel.  Reservations for
student rooms will be made through the official travel agent.  A small
number of travel scholarships may be available to defray part or all of
the expenses of attending the conference.  Interested students should
submit a letter of application describing their research interests, the
year they expect to receive their degree, and a brief letter of
recommendation from their major professor.  Please state the amount of
support required. The number and size of awards will be limited by the
total money available.

Persons with disabilities may contact Herbert Roitblat for information
on accessibility.  Advance notice is advised, if you have special needs
and request an accomodation.  The University of Hawaii is an Equal
Opportunity/Affirmative Action Institution.

Travel Information

Theo Stahl, Associated Travel, 947 Keeaumoku Street, Honolulu, HI 96814
(808) 949-1033, (800) 745-3444, (808) 949-1037 (fax) is the official
travel agent for the conference.  Participants are encouraged, but not
required, to make their travel arrangements through Ms Stahl.  United
Airlines is offering a special conference rate for participants from US
as well as European, Japanese, and Australian gateway cities served by
United.  Ms Stahl is very knowledgeable about the local travel market
and can make arrangements to visit neighbor islands (including Hawaii
with its active volcano) and for other activities.

Please make your travel arrangements early because Hawaii is a popular
destination in December and the conference is scheduled just before the
start of the busiest season.
