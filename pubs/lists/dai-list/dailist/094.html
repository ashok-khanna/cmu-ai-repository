           SOCIAL SCIENCE PERSPECTIVES ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 A Special Issue of The ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)

The ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS) announces a Special
Issue devoted to the applications of theories and methods of the social
sciences to understand the development, social organization, role, and
impacts of information systems in organizations.

Possible topics include studies of the social processes of implementing
large scale information systems, the relationship of information systems
developments to changes in organizational strategy, the role of
information systems in changing the organization of work, the ways that
information systems fit or help change organizational cultures, and the
social dynamics of groups that develop or use information systems.

Empirical studies which carefully examine key social processes that
influence the nature or impacts information systems are of particular
interest, whether they use qualitative or quantitative data. Theoretical
papers can also be appropriate if they carefully use empirical materials
to help illustrate and explain the value of the theoretical position
which is advanced.  Authors should take special care in indicating the
ways that their papers help advance the research frontiers.  The special
issue editor will be particularly sympathetic to papers that develop
new empirical or theoretical directions, as long as the rationale for
and value of the innovations is well developed.

The TOIS editors consider information systems to be a label with broad
meanings, and includes: electronic mail, books, libraries, classrooms,
museums, decision and meeting support systems, and entertainment
systems, as well as more traditional transaction processing systems and
networks of such systems.

The editor for this special issue is
Professor Rob Kling
Department of Information and Computer Science
University of California, Irvine
Irvine, Ca 92717
714-856-5955    kling@ics.uci.edu

The special issue will be published in July 1994. In order to allow
adequate time for review, revisions, and publication, five copies of
each paper must be submitted by February 26, 1993 to:

Dr. Robert B. Allen
Editor in Chief, TOIS
Room 2A-367
Bell Communications Research, Inc.
445 South Street
Morristown  NJ  07960-1910
[201/829-4315  rba@bellcore.com]

Please see the July 1990 issue of TOIS for guidelines about format.

High quality papers that are submitted or revised late, or whose focus
does not fit this special issue, might be accepted for publication in
subsequent issues of TOIS.  Papers will be reviewed as soon as they are
received.  Since some papers might require revision before final
acceptance, time is being allowed for revision and re-review of
promising papers.  It would be advantageous for authors to submit papers
as soon as possible to allow adequate time for reviews and possible
revisions.  Questions about the scope of the special issue should be
directed to Professor Rob Kling.

Call for papers and participation for

               Simulating Societies '93
                   24-26 July 1993
Approaches to Simulating Social Phenomena and Social Processes

Although the value of simulating complex phenomena in order to come to a
better understanding of their nature is well recognised, it is still
rare for simulation to be used to understand social processes.  This
symposium is intended to present original research, review current
ideas, compare alternative approaches and suggest directions for future
work on the simulation of social processes.  It follows the first
symposium held in April 1992 at the University of Surrey, UK.

It is expected that about a dozen papers will be presented to the
symposium and that revised versions will be published as a book.  We are
now seeking proposals for papers and for participation.  Contributions
from a range of disciplines, including sociology, anthropology,
archaeology, ethology, artificial intelligence, and artificial life, are
very welcome.

Papers on the following and related topics are invited:
*   Discussions of approaches to the simulation of social processes such
    as those based on distributed artificial intelligence, genetic
    algorithms and neural networks, nonlinear systems, general purpose
    stochastic simulation systems, etc.
*   Accounts of specific simulations of processes and phenomena, at a
    macro or micro level.
*   Critical reviews of existing work that has involved the simulation
    of social processes.
*   Reviews of simulation work in archeology, economics, psychology,
    geography, demography, etc. with lessons for the simulation of
    social processes.
*   Arguments for or against simulation as an approach to understanding
    complex social processes.
*   Simulations of human, animal and 'possible' societies.

'Social process' may be interpreted widely to include, for example, the
rise and fall of nation states, the behaviour of households, the
evolution of animal societies, and social interaction.

Registration, accommodation and subsistence expenses during the meeting
will be met by the sponsors.  Participants will need to find their own
travel expenses.  Proposals for papers are initially invited in the form
of an abstract of no more than 300 words.  Abstracts should be sent,
along with a brief statement of research interests, to the address below
by 15th March 1993.  Authors of those selected will be invited to submit
full papers by 1st June 1993.  Those interested in participating, but
not wishing to present a paper, should send a letter indicating the
contribution they could make to the symposium, also by 15th March 1993.

The organisers of the Symposium are Cristiano Castelfranchi (IP-CNR and
University of Siena, Italy), Jim Doran (University of Essex, UK), Nigel
Gilbert (University of Surrey, UK), and Domenico Parisi (IP- CNR, Roma,
Italy).

The symposium is sponsored by the University of Siena (Corso di laurea
in Scienze della Comunicazione), the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche
(Istituto di Psicologia, Roma) and the University of Surrey.

The meeting will be held at Certosa di Pontignano near Siena, Italy, a
conference centre on the site of a 1400AD monastery.

Proposals should be sent to:
Prof Nigel Gilbert, Department of Sociology, University of Surrey, 
Guildford GU2 5XH, United Kingdom
