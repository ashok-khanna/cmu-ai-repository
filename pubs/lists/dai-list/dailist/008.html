            SECOND CALL-FOR-PAPER NOTICE

                              A Working Conference On
                        COOPERATING KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS
                                 October 3-5, 1990
                            University of Keele, England


            The objective of the conference is  to  bring  database  and
            A.I.  researchers together, from both academia and industry,
            in order to discuss the issues of  the  next  generation  of
            knowledge  based systems.  The themes to be covered will in-
            clude:

                 Interaction of data and knowledge bases
                 Distributed knowledge base systems
                 Modular knowledge base systems
                 Cooperating expert systems
                 Multiagent systems
                 Mixed-mode systems

            It is hoped that  the  presence  of  both  database  and  AI
            researchers  will  help  to bring about a synthesis of ideas
            for fruitful industrial applications.  The conference is be-
            ing  organised  by the Data and Knowledge Engineering (DAKE)
            Centre at the University of Keele.  A  number  of  organisa-

            this event.
