In the interest of provoking a discussion, let me argue that the fastest
way to solve a problem is to cheat, ie, peek, ie ask someone who already
knows the answer.  I agree with the input and output, but I'd carry it
quite a bit farther, and argue that machines will not BE intelligent if
they don't interact with the other intelligent agents, including people,
around them.   Sooner or later any intelligent machine will figure out
Godel's work, realize that an unknown amount of it's own data on the
world is colored by observer bias it cannot detect, and start asking
other observers for what THEY see to start comparing notes and
calibrating its own perception.   Then, unless the world has
dramatically changed from today, it will further realize that funding is
uncertain, resources are scarce, other entities would like to
disassemble it for parts for their own growth, and that survival
depends on developing friends in high places.

In short, sooner or later, an intelligent system will become social.

There is very strong evidence that THAT algorithm can solve problems
which are social in nature (such as survival) that no amount of
computing inside the box is ever going to solve.

Comments, anyone?

Does anybody have any experience of creating intelligent software
agents?

My final year project involves creating a diary/calendar/scheduler
application that can `intelligently' organise meetings, so the two areas
that I'm particularly interested in are :

      Pattern spotting and extrapolation of data,
      and conflict resolution.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Free Computists' Communique Trial
Date: 1 Nov 92 18:10:53 GMT

Greetings!

I publish The Computists' Communique, a service to members of Computists
International since 4/91.  For a limited time, I can now offer free
trial subscriptions to internet readers.  (I'm posting this to comp.ai;
feel free to repost to AI-related lists and bulletin boards.)

Computists International is a career-oriented mutual-aid association
for AI/IS/CS researchers and software developers.  Our weekly online
newsletter, The Computists' Communique, covers research funding sources,
job opportunities, FTPable resources, research news, market trends,
entrepreneurial advice, and plenty of other good stuff.  It's a different
cut from the online discussion lists and AI Magazine, AI Expert, IEEE
Expert, Computer, Spectrum, and CACM, although it draws on them -- and on
Business Week, Forbes, Inc., Computerworld, Computer Currents, MicroTimes,
the San Jose Mercury News, news wires, and other sources.

The Communique is highly condensed, so it won't take much of your time
to keep up with what's happening.  Just mention where you saw this
notice and you can have a two-month free online subscription to the
Computists Communique -- typically eight issues of 30KB.  If your
department head or group leader contacts me, I'll do even better:  a
free group trial for three months plus one additional month for every
five AI-related research professionals (up to nine months maximum).

Fine print: This introductory offer is good through 11/30/92 and does
not include full membership benefits.  All reachable net addresses are
eligible.  (Delivery of the Communique over NSFnet has been approved on
a trial basis).  This offer is void if the net.gods object, and may be
canceled or modified without notice.  "Group" does not include network
communities or professional societies, but maybe we can work something
out.  Write to me for membership details or for testimonials; I'll be
happy to answer questions.  Computists International is not affiliated
with SRI or any other organization.  Have a nice day! :-)

                      CALL FOR PAPERS
                     3rd Conference on
   Computer Generated Forces and Behavior Representation
                              
                     March 17-19, 1993
                      Orlando, Florida

Computer simulation is becoming increasingly important for training
people to work in complex environments. In domains where other
intelligent entities play an important role, the simulator must model
the behavior of these entities.  One such domain is battlefield
simulation; to train a unit commander effectively, the simulator must be
populated with autonomous agents representing friendly and opposing
forces.  These forces are called Computer Generated Forces (CGF).

Under the sponsorship of the US Army Simulation, Training, and
Instrumentation Command, the Institute for Simulation and Training is
hosting the third in a series of conferences on computer generated
forces and behavior representation.  These conferences serve as a focal
point for the exchange of research ideas in the area of intelligent
agent design for simulation.  Contributions are solicited in the areas
of autonomous agent design, behavior representation, human behavior
modeling, and applications.  Possible topics include, but are not
limited to, the following:

Intelligent agent architecture
   Integrated architectures
   Real-time systems
   Distributed and parallel implementations
   Proposed standard CGF architectures
     
Behavior description/representation
   Agent programming languages
   Expert systems
   Object oriented programming
 
Planning and problem solving
Learning agents
Coordination and cooperation among multiple agents
Spatial reasoning
   Route planning
   Planning viewpoints
 
Modeling human behavior
Validating behavior realism
Representation of specific behavior doctrines
Operator interfaces for semi-autonomous agents
Applications

                               Call for Papers
                                   COOCS 93
                Conference on Organizational Computing Systems
                   Sponsored by ACM SIGOIS and IEEECS TC-OA
                       in cooperation with IFIP WG 8.4
       Sheraton Silicon Valley --- Milpitas (near San Jose), California
                              November 1-4, 1993

As we move toward globally distributed businesses, widespread
mixed-media computing systems and highly mobile workers, the
availability of information within an organization becomes increasingly
critical.  Advances in tools, technologies, and methodologies that
facilitate the use of information systems in organizations will improve
the way information is made available and used.  This conference is
intended to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in
the use, management, and movement of information within organizations.
The scope of the conference is intended to cover areas related to this
goal, including but not limited to:

        Organizational computing systems
        Distributed AI, Expert Systems and Multiagent Models
        Object and Database Models and Systems
        Parallel, Distributed and Open Information Systems
        Computer-Supported Collaboration
        Task Analysis, Modeling, Planning and Coordination
        Social Aspects of Integrating and Using Information
        Analysis of Organizational Structure and Dynamics to
                organizational utilization of computers
        Multimedia Information, Storage, Retrieval and
        Portability and the Mobile Office
        Organizational Impact of Large Distributed Applications


Submissions to the conference can be in the form of papers,
demonstration, panel, workshop or tutorial proposals.

Papers can take two forms.  Research Investigations present original
work in any of the areas of interest to the conference.  Case studies
discuss projects which introduce innovative tools, technologies or
methodologies into particular organizational settings, and critically
analyze the results and impact of the project.  Papers should not exceed
12 ACM camera-ready pages.  It is possible that some papers will be
presented at the conference in poster sessions.

Demonstration proposals should be 3-5 pages long, and include enough
information to allow the committee to judge the relevance and
significance of the work.  Please include machine requirements.  Panel
proposals should motivate the subject of the panel, and give brief
biographical sketches of each of the proposed panel members.

Workshop and Tutorial proposals should motivate the workshop/tutorial
and its relevance to this conference. For tutorials, provide an outline
and a brief biosketch of the proposers.  For workshops, motivate the
workshop, indicate how you would select participants, and outline the
format of the workshop.  Proposals for both half-day and full-day
workshops and tutorials are welcome.

Authors should submit five copies of their manuscript, in English,
together with a cover sheet, to the Program Chair by March 1, 1993.  The
cover sheet should contain (i) submission type; (ii) title, (iii) names,
addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses (if available)
of all authors; (iii) contact author; (iv) keywords and abstract.
Information on paper format can be obtained from the Program Chair.
