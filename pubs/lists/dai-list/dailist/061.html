Subject: Suggestions for Applications Wanted

Dear All,

The CONSENSUS project here at the University of Durham, England is
involved in research into methodologies for the development of large,
parallel and cooperating knowledge based systems.  This is a
collaborative project involving British Aerospace Ltd. and Cambridge
Consultants Ltd.

In a first major test application we have implemented a decision support
system for en-route air traffic control and now we are looking for a
second suitable test application.  We invite any suggestions for
candidate applications on which we can apply the methodology that has
been developed.

Since we have a development team of 4 and only about 6 months in which
to implement the second application, there are a number of requirements
the potential application should fulfill:

   1) the problem should be well-defined, preferrably with some
      existing set of requirements.
   2) there should be some inherent concurrency allowing the 
      construction of systems built of cooperating knowledge-based
      components
   3) the size should reflect the available manpower, and therefore
      be manageable
   4) the problem should not require a great amount of familiarisation
   5) the problem need not be very practical, but should concentrate 
      on more typical AI aspects such as decision taking and/or 
      planning

We have produced a methodology that combines a structured analysis
technique for the system specification with a system architecture that
builds systems out of cooperating knowledge based components.  The
second application will therefore serve to refine the methodology.

We would appreciate suggestions for a second application, and we are
also interested to hear of any progress that has been made with
methodologies that address the development of large, parallel
cooperating knowledge based systems, especially with real-time
implications.

Subject: CFP ISDSS meeting

ISDSS, the International Society for Decision Support Systems, will have
its second conference in Ulm, Germany, June, 22-25, 1992. The conference
will put particular emphasis on the following areas:

IDSS Foundations (e.g. concepts, architectures)
IDSS Development (e.g. tools, methods)
IDSS Usage and Evalutation (e.g. effects, metrics)
IDSS Applications (e.g. system features, experiences)

Unpublished papers are invited in the areas listed above. For this
conference, theoretical, empirical, and applied research will be
considered. Especially sought is work concerned with modeling and solver
integration, multiparticipant decision support, distributed/parallel
decision environments, DSS quality assessment, artificially intelligent
DSS, and multidisciplinary approaches to decision support.

A three page synopsis of the research paper should be submitted by
November 30, 1991. The submission should identify in which of the four
areas the paper fits. The synopsis will be refereed as a basis for the
organizing committee's decision about whether to invite a presentation
based on the paper. Notification of acceptance will occur by February
15, 1992. To be included in the ISDSS Conference Proceedings, the
complete version of the accepted paper, incorporating feedback from the
conference, should be received by August 31, 1992. The organizing
committee will subsequently edit a special issue of Decision Support
Systems composed of selected, fully-refereed papers from the ISDSS
conference.

All submissions should be sent to:

THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
ANNOUNCES ITS SECOND CONFERENCE (Second ISDSS-Conference)

EXPLORING THE NEXT GENERATION OF DECISION SUPPORT

June 22-25, 1992
Ulm, Germany

The ISDSS conference provides a forum for the international community of
DSS researchers and practioners to share ideas, insights, and
observations about the frontiers of the DSS field. It is intended to
promote the next wave of advances in the field through informative,
stimulative, and evocative interchanges among participants. The
conference includes overview lectures on trends in DSS, presentations of
DSS researcher papers, panel discussions, and system demonstrations.
There is a registration cap of 90 participants.

Registration fee for ISDSS member is DM 300,-, others DM 400,-. The fee
includes local transportation, refreshments, meals and social program.
