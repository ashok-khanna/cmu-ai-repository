                               ISADS 93
                          CALL  FOR  PAPERS
                 The First International Symposium on
                   Autonomous Decentralized Systems
                       March 30 - April 1, 1993
                 Hitachi System Plaza, Kawasaki, Japan
 
Co-sponsored by IEEE Computer Society
                Information Processing Society of Japan
                Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan
In cooperation with International Federation for Information Processing
                    International Federation of Automatic Control

Scope:
Continuous growth in the power, intelligence, and openness of computer,
communication, and control technologies has made it possible to realize
highly beneficial and dependable business and control systems.
Consequently, the adaptability, reliability, and expandability of
application systems are steadily improving.  Also, dynamically changing
social and economic situations are requiring new-age systems based on
newly emerging technologies and applications.  Such systems are expected
to have the characteristics of a living thing composed of largely
autonomous and decentralized components.  The systems may thus be called
Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS).

ISADS seeks papers that will foster increased interactions among
researchers and practitioners in computer, control, and other related
fields from academia and industry.

The scope of discussion on ADS shall include but not be limited to:
- Distributed and parallel computer systems / Large scale systems;
- Cooperative architectures (CSCW, ODP, DAF); 
- Local and wide area networks / Intelligent networks;
- Fault-tolerance, real-time, expansion and maintenance, and
  software engineering technologies for ADS;
- Heterogeneous distributed information systems;
- Decentralized-control, self-organizing, and robotic systems;
- Manufacturing systems;
- Biological and ecological systems.

Papers dealing with research, development, implementation and
applications of ADS, as well as surveys of the field, are welcome.

Plant Tour:
A plant tour of leading-edge industries in Japan is planned as part of
Symposium activities.  Visits to Kawasaki Steel Corporation and Central
Japan Railway Company are arranged on April 2, 1993 with the highlights
as a post symposium tour.  At the present, ADS have been operated at
these two sites as process control system for flexible manufacturing
with various-kinds small-quantities products and as traffic control
system for reliable train traffic regulation with 1,100 bullet-trains in
one day respectively.

Keynote Address:
Three distinguished speakers will deliver the keynote addresses during
the Symposium, as follows:
- Dr. Hiroshi Inose, Director General of National Center for Science
                     Information Systems and Chair of Industrial
                     Technology Council of the Japanese Ministry of 
                     International Trade and Industry (MITI)	
- Dr. Roland Huber, Director for the R & D Programs of the Commission of
                    Euroean Committees
- Dr. A. Nico Habermann, Professor of Carnegie-Mellon University

Submission:
Each paper must be limited to 6000 words(in English), full-page figures
being counted as 300 words, and must include a short abstract, a list of
key words, and the lead author's address.  Eight (8) copies of each
papers should be submitted to the Program Chair.  The lead author of
each submitted paper will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of
the paper.  One of authors will be required to present their paper at
the symposium.  No submission of papers via FAX or Email will be
accepted.

Subject: ICED93 - Workshop on Teamwork in Design

Workshop on Theory and Methods for Teamwork in Design

Next year, the 9th International Conference on Engineering Design,
ICED93 will be held from August 17-19 in The Hague, the Netherlands

One of the suggested topics of this conference is multidisciplinary
teamwork in product development.  We sent in a proposal for a workshop
on Theory and Methods for Teamwork in Design.

Important aspects of today's competition in manufactured products are
complexity, high quality, and short development time. The application of
quality function deployment, integrated computer systems and concurrent
engineering are but a few examples of ideas developed in research and
industrial practice to improve product designs to meet these demands.
Any of the methods used, manual or computer-based, will have to be able
to support the coordinated work of teams of experts, in all phases of
the product life cycle. To date, there is no coherent theory about the
interactions between the people, the (organisational and design)
environment, and the variety of design problems which characterize
teamwork in typical design situations.

The aim of the workshop is to provide a vehicle for intensive discussion
on selected conference papers treating the methods and computational
supports used by teams of designers and other specialists during product
development. The issues to be discussed at the workshop will include,
but are not limited to:

* What are the variables that distinguish teamwork from nonteamwork, and
  how do they affect design?

* How can we capture processes involving teamwork in design?

* What software/hardware configurations are available or planned to 
  support teamwork?

We would like to attract especially those who have done work in

* human aspects of teamwork 

* analysis of design activities within groups

* groupware: shared electronic sketching facilities, software for video
  conferencing, applications of multimedia/hyperdocuments in
  design/manufacture

If you are interested in presenting a paper in the workshop, please send
in three copies of the abstract of your paper before the 1st of
September 1992 to the conference organisation for review (see contact
address or ask us for further information ( both can send you a brochure
about ICED93)). Please add the following heading to your abstract:
"Intended for the workshop on teamwork in design". Acccepted papers will
be published in the proceedings. The workshop is open for attendence,
not only to those presenting a paper, but to all conference
participants.

We hope you will be able to contribute to the workshop. We are looking
forward to hearing from you or see you at the ICED93, sincerely,
