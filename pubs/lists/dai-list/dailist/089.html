			CALL FOR PAPERS

Special Track on Issues on Cooperating Heterogeneous Intelligent Agents
			to be part of the
     First International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative
		    Information Systems (ICICIS) 

 Held in cooperation with: IEEE CS, ACM SIGART, AAAI, IFIP TC-12, NGI

I. Description

The purpose of this call is to solicit papers for a special track that
will consist of a series of sessions on issues relating to heterogeneous
intelligent agents that are cooperating during problem-solving.
Heterogeneous intelligent systems can differ in their internal
structures, capabilities, and purposes.  Of primary interest are
approaches and techniques for overcoming limitations that are introduced
through the heterogeneity of information-storage and problem-solving
agents.

II. Topics

1. Studies of the types of cooperation and negotiation that can be
achieved by heterogeneous systems.

2. Knowledge-level analyses of the components that belong to such
systems, and formalisms for representing this knowledge.

3. Architectures and frameworks for combining independent AI systems to
enable them collectively to solve more complex problems.

4. Issues related to the integration of heterogeneous database systems
as information providers in problem-solving environments.

5. Intelligent computer environments that facilitate cooperation among
people of diverse abilities during a problem-solving process, including
developments in intelligent groupware systems.

6. Ontologies for integrating heterogeneous agents.

III. Format

Contributions should be submitted in double spaced format, not exceeding
the length of 5000 words.  Please indicate on the first page that the
paper is a submission to the special track on Issues on Cooperating
Heterogeneous Intelligent Agents.

	We further point out that one of the requirements in such an

	of factual information. The paper presents a framework for
	optimization in coupling an expert system and a database management
	system (DBMS) in such a way to satisfy this requirement. We adopt
	a loose coupling strategy as a practical solution allowing utilization
	of an existing DBMS. Specifically, it presents the technique of normalizing
	the logic query, implementation primitives, and the set of access
	strategies as mappings between the normalized primitives and implementation
	primitives. These techniques are discussed in the context of an expert
	system shell, SQL Inference Engine for Network Applications (SIENA),
	being developed at IBM research. The authors believe that these techniques

	that exploits the database algorithms executing on a commercially
	available, parallel architecture called a hypercube multicomputer.
	With this approach, we seek to achieve the high degree of computational
	parallelism necessary to explore rapidly the global-state space of
	even very complex protocols, significantly reducing the time required
	to verify a protocol and allowing formal verification to be included
	as a part of the process of protocol design. Our approach is based
	on the relational database algorithms for a hypercube system 
	and the relational algebra approach to verify
	finite-state protocols. }

   comments ={The development of intelligent routing control systems has become
increasingly important, both for using network resources efficiently and
making new and advanced services attractive to users. Intelligent routing
control is defined here as the process in which the network interrogates
the databases containing  the relationships between logical numbers, such
as personal or information identifiers, and physical addresses in the transport
network to find the terminal having the information required to process
a user request.

Our routing control system uses distributed databases, each of which manages
a switching system and all of which are connected through high-speed signaling
networks separate from the transport network. If the requested physical
address cannot be found in one database, search requests are distributed
at the same time to all other databases. For up to 100 million subscribers,
the routing control system can find a physical address within 1 s when each
database uses 10 memories accessed at 100 ns with an interdatabase linkage
speed of 14 Mbits/s.}

   Comments ={As computer networks proliferate, the imprtance of interconnecting
networks increases.  Major technical issues that must be solved  include
selection of  a protocol  level at  which to  interconnect,  addressing,
routing, fragmentation  and congestion  control.   Often, a  specialized
{\it gateway} device is used to interconnect networks and implement  any
necessary internet  protocols.    Two  leading  alternatives  have  been
developed by the DRAPA  Internet community (datagram internet  protocol)
and by  the CCITT  for public  data networks  (concatenation of  virtual
circuits).   The  new  ISO  standards  encompass  both  approaches,  but
providing interoperability between them is still a problem.}

            OPS5 with UMass GBB}",
   volume = {3},
   year = {1991},
   comments={Typically, AI shells have a Ptolemaic view of their universe. 
Although some  shells  provide  advanced  interfacing  capabilities  and
others can be embedded within a conventional application, most cannot be
easily  integrated   as   closely-coupled   components   of   a   larger
problem-solving system.   This  paper discusses  the requirements  of  a
problem-solving architecture that can : be tightly embedded within other
architectures and coexist with multiple instances of itself and of other
problem-solvers.  The additional effort needed to produce and  embedable
problem-solving architecture  is  minor,  compared  to  the  substantial
increase in applicability of the architecture.

A specific  need  for embedable  problem-solvers  arose with  the  UMass
Generic Blackboard Framework  (UMass GBB).   UMass GBB is  based on  the
blackboard   paradigm,   which   naturally   integrates    heterogeneous
problem-solving representations as individual knowledge sources  (KS's).
In principle, in UMass GBB,  a KS can be  written using any embedded  AI
shell.  Thus, this need was pursued by developing general specifications
for embedable problem-solving architectures, and then the specifications
were used to modify the public-domain version of OPS5 in order to  embed
it as an integral KS language within UMass GBB.}

is  becoming  an  increasingly  demanding  task  that  is  difficult  to
implement using prsend manual methods even when assisted by conventional
automation techniques.    Integration  of advanced  AI  technology  into
existing and future network management  systems may resolve some of  the
difficulties.   This paper  describes a  preliminary network  management
prototype that is based on the cooperation of two components.  A Network
Monitoring and Control System  (NMCS), which exploits advanced  database
management, graphics and man/machine interfcing techniques, is used  for
data collection  and  status evaluation.    The second  component  is  a
Rule-Based Expert  System that  uses its  acquired expert  knowledge  to
recommend appropriate  control  actions  to  alleviate  the  effects  of
network stresses detected by the NMCS. Preliminary results  demonstrate
the validity of  the above  concept.   Future research  will expand  the
scope of  this prototype  and will  develop an  organizational  multiple
network management  systems.   Both  hierarchical  and  non-hierarchical
organizations will be considered.}

   comments={With the 1984 divestiture of the Bell Operating Companies from
AT\&T, the newly formed Regional Operating Companies embarked upon a program
to deploy on infrastucture for new service offerings--an infrastructure
called the ``Intelligent Network.'' This network is changing the face of
telecommunications by allowing new services to be deployed quickly and
ubiquity and service uniformity. The first services on the new regional
Intelligent Networks were Data Base 800 (free phone) Service and Calling
Card Service, and today, these regional networks are handling millions of
800 number and Calling Cards per day.

This papaer traces the realization of the Intelligent Network concept, first
in the former Bell System in the early 1980's, and subsequently in the
Regional Operating Companies, post divestiture. It describes the history of
common channel signalling and the introduction of 800 Service, Calling Card
Service and Private Virtual Network Service. It introduces the familiy of
network nodes and operations systems that are the major players in the
Intelligent Network and suggests their potential application for a wealth of
new voice, data, and video services. Finally, it describes the next
generation of the Intelligent Network, called the Advanced Intelligent
Network, which through its service creation capabilities holds out a promise
for rapid service development and a cornucopia of new customized services.}

	narratives (stories like Hansel and Gretel) when the plans of two
	individuals are carried out in an interactive situation. A notation
	for representing interacting plans is presented and applied to a
	section from the brothers Grimms' story. The analysis shows how a

	interaction with others and how interactive episodes can be used
	deceptively by one party to achieve their own covert goals."

	systems, negotiation plays an important role in how agents
	cooperate. Negotiation among multiple agents involves agents
	reaching a consensus through the process of conflict detection,
	propagation and resolution. The paper describes the role of
	negotiation in the different stages of the problem solving process,
	namely during the formulation of goals, the selection of active
	goals, the allocation of goals, the achievement of these goals and
	the organization of agents. Previous work in this area is discussed
	with respect to the different stages where negotiation can be used."

	well in hierarchical organisational structures, many are adaptable
	to to much larger classes of structures."
