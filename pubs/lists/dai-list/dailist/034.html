Subject: Summer Position in DAI at GTE Labs
Date: Wed, 8 May 91 11:19:04 EDT

Dear Colleague,

Our Distributed AI project at GTE Laboratories has a need for a summer
student (June to September 91).  The requirements for that position are
described below.  I would appreciate it very much if you would pass this
on to those who might be interested.
________________________________________________________________
Summer Position:

The DAI project is developing a multiagent architecture for customer
network control and cooperative operation support systems.  The project
is currently in need of a person (summer position) to assist in building
domain models using the PRODIGY planning system developed at CMU.  This
position will also entail research responsibilities.  The candidate
should be able to contribute to current research activities on a general
interagent language and on multiagent joint planning and coordination
strategies.  A background in AI is required for this position.
Desirable attributes for the position include experience on Symbolics
and/or Sun platforms with demonstrated proficiency in LISP and ability
to sustain good team interaction.
________________________________________________________________

There is another set of tasks on our project for which a UNIX hacker may
also be a good person for the summer.  We need to build the graphics
demo and multimachine communication environment for our agents on the
new SPARC 2's we are acquiring.

GTE Laboratories provides a well-supported research environment, a
friendly atmosphere, proximity to an abundance of cultural centers in
the Boston area, as well as vast opportunities for personal and
professional growth.

I would need to get feedback before the end of May.  For more
information about this position, contact me (info below).  Email is
preferable, but if you need to use the USPS: GTE Laboratories Inc., 40
Sylvan Road, Waltham, MA 02254.  An equal opportunity employer, M/F/H/V.

Thanks in advance for your help.
