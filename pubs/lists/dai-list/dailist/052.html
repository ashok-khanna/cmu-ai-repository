Subject: DPS vs. MA?

I do feel the recent discussions concerning MA and DPS are of help to
me.  But when I read Werkman's message in Digest #48 just now (due to
the one-month failure of our mailer), immediately another way to
classify the distributed systems was reminded. Lesser and Corkill in
their paper entitled " Functionally Accurate, Cooperative Distributed
Systems " characterize distributed systems into four extremes:
Completely Accurate/Nearly Autonomous (CA/NA), Functionally
Accurate/Cooperative (FA/C), Completely Accurate/Cooperative (CA/C) and
Functionally Accurate/Nearly Autonomous (FA/NA).  Personally I am more
in favour of this classification as it DIRECTLY highlights two important
links amongst agents -- data and control uncertainties.  Explicitly
based on these two criteria, it becomes relatively easier to catalogue
the DAI systems, for example (please correct me if I am wrong),

-- DVMT (by Durfee, Lesser, Corkill, et al. at UMass) is a typical FA/C
system
-- ATC (Air-traffic Control by Cammarata, McArthur and Steeb at Rand
Corp.) falls into CA/C
-- the framework introduced in paper "Cooperation without Communication"
(by Genesereth, Ginsberg and Rosenschein at Stanford U.) and DSS
(Distributed Sensing System by Randall Davis and Reid G. Smith) falls
into CA/NA.

As a conclusion, I feel the reason we cannot draw a CLEAR line between
DPS and MA lies in the fact that we have not objectively specified what
should construct that line.  If we take the existing uncertainties of
data and control amongst agents as the object criteria, obviously Lesser
and Corkill have drawn a clear one.

Any comments are appreciated!
