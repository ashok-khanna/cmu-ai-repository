ORGANIZATIONAL FLUIDITY AND SUSTAINABLE COOPERATION

Abstract

We show that fluid organizations display levels of cooperation that are
higher than those found in groups that are either unorganized or have
fixed social structure.  By moving within the organization, individuals
cause restructurings that facilitate cooperation.  Computer experiments
simulating fluid organizations faced with a social dilemma reveal a
myriad of complex cooperative behavior that results from the interplay
between individual strategies and structural changes.  Significantly,
fluid organizations can display long cycles of sustained cooperation
interrupted by short bursts of defection.

Subject: Multiple defeasible hetereogeneous inheritance reasoner
Date: Fri, 5 Mar 1993 08:13:31 GMT

I have just uploaded the code for a multiple defeasible heterogeneous
inheritance reasoner as described in my dissertation:

Ballim, A.  (1992) "ViewFinder:  A Framework for Representing, Ascribing
and Maintaining Nested Beliefs of Interacting Agents," Ph.D.
Dissertation, Dept.  d'Informatique, Universite de Geneve, Geneva,
Switzerland.

to the ftp sites where the dissertation is stored (details below).  This
reasoner is based on the theory originally described in:

Ballim, A., D.  Fass & S.  Candelaria de Ram (1988a) "Resolving a clash
of intuitions:  Utilizing strict and defeasible information in
inheritance systems," Memoranda in Computer and Cognitive Science,
MCCS-88-119, Computing Research Laboratory, New Mexico State University,
Las Cruces, NM.

Ballim, A., D.  Fass & S.  Candelaria de Ram (1988b) "HETIS:  a
Heterogeneous Inheritance System," ISSCO Working papers, 55, ISSCO, 54
rte.  des Acacias, 1227 Geneva, Switzerland.

Ballim, A., S.  Candelaria de Ram & D.  Fass (1989) "Reasoning using
Inheritance from a Mixture of Knowledge and Beliefs," in Knowledge Based
Computer Systems (Proceedings of KCBS '89), S.  R.  Ramani & K.
Anjaneylu, eds., Narosa Publishing House, Delhi, 387--396.

The program is written in Sicstus prolog, and so should run with Quintus
and it should be easily convertible to any Edinburgh-style prolog.

Also archived at the ftp sites are my dissertation plus a copy of an
important program that forms a subpart of it (called ViewGen).  The
dissertation is concerned with representing,forming, and maintaining
nested models of agent attitudes, in particular belief.  The ViewGen
program implements one of the belief ascription algorithms described in
the dissertation, and is a core element in my book with Yorick Wilks,

As a courtesy to the people at this site (thank you Stefan) please try
to restrict ftp access to time slots outside office hours. The load on
the machine usually is pretty high between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. CET.
Currently there are no restrictions on ftp access on this host. It's up
to you whether it can be kept that way.

Please note that ftp access to ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de is monitored,
i.e., they keep a log of the hosts that had connections and which files
are up-/downloaded.

The dissertation is available in a number of formats.  Each tar file
contains the appropriate PostScript file, plus a readme file.

1) A5 format -- this is really A4, but with two pages side by side in
landscape mode (each being an A5 page). The file to get if you want this
is ViewFinder-A5.tar.Z

2) A4 format -- the file is formatted to fill an A4 page.
ViewFinder-A4.tar.Z 

3) US Letter -- the file is formatted to fill a US Letter page.
ViewFinder-US.tar.Z

ViewGen is available in the file ViewGen.tar.Z
and the inheritance reasoner is the file vf-hetis.tar.Z

    IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
                     CALL FOR PAPERS
       Special Issue on Dependability of A.I. Systems

Many systems with artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed to
deal with problems in industrial, scientific, and financial
applications. Despite the great potential of these systems and millions
of dollars invested on their research and development, the major concern
faced in industry today is whether these systems are dependable. This is
particularly important for applications that involve human safety. In
view of this important and evolving topic, a special issue of IEEE
Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering will be dedicated to this
topics. This special issue will cover formal techniques, systems, and
methodology to support the development and maintenance of dependable
A.I. systems including, but not limited, the following topics:

o Knowledge Elicitation and Acquisition
o Knowledge Base and Representation
o Validation and Verification of Knowledge Base
o Reliability of A.I. Systems
o Safety and Security of A.I. Systems
o Maintainability of A.I. Systems
o Portability of A.I. Systems
o Performance Evaluation
o Autonomous Decentralized Systems
o Distributed Real-Time AI Systems
o Friendly User Interfaces for A.I. systems
o Knowledge Base Tools 
o Architecture, Methodology, and their Comparative Study and Tool
  Support

Subject: Summary: Knowbots and Intelligent Agents
Date: Fri, 12 Mar 1993 18:01:54 GMT

Here is a summary of responses I received to the following query:
:Any pointers to articles on Knowbots and Intelligent Agents?  Who
:coined the term "knowbot"? How do the strategies that knowbots use
:differ from those of typical knowledge-based systems? 
-Jeff

I first ran across "knowbot" in the article "Networks" by Vinton G. Cerf
in the Scientific American Special Issue on Communications, Computers,
and Networks, September, 1991, page 74.  He remarks that "knowbot" is a
registered trademark of the Corporation for National Research
Innitiatives.

As an aside,the Prodigy network updated my access program extensively
without my request after I had to reboot from my original disks. Would
you consider this type of update a knowbot?

I've been looking for information on the subject myself. Here's one
pointer that could be useful: "Distributed Artificial Intelligence: An
Annotated Bibliogrpahy" (ACM SIGART Bulletin, August 1992, pp. 20-37).

The term "knowbot" was coined by Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf at the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) and is actually a
registered trademark of CNRI.  It is a type of intelligent agent
specifically conceived for use in CNRI's proposed digital library system
(see [6] for details).

Here's a somewhat dated list of knowbot references as the term "knowbot"
seems to be losing out to the more general term "intelligent agent" in
the literature.  Maybe someone else can post more current references on
knowbot-like intelligent agents...

of Intellectual Property Rights in a Digital Library System, May 18-19,
1989," Corporation for National Research Initiatives, Reston, VA, 1989.
(about 30 pages, includes sections on:  Definitional Framework,
Operation of a Digital Library System, Conditions and Enforcement,
Business Structures, Role of Government in a DLS, Conclusions on the
Workshop)

2. Anonomyous, "Gigabit Network Testbeds," Computer, 23(9):77-80,

5. Davis, Bob, "Group Wins Funds to Study Network of Fast Computers,"
_Wall Street Journal_, B4 (Eastern), 11 June 1990.  (discusses NSF/DOD
contract to Corp. for National Research Initiatives for research in
high-speed computer networks; doesn't discuss knowbots directly)

6. Kahn, Robert E., Vinton G. Cerf, "The Digital Library Project; Volume
1:  The World of Knowbots (DRAFT); An Open Architecture for a Digital
Library System and a Plan for Its Development," Corporation for National
Research Initiatives, Reston, VA, March 1988. (86 pages, including
sections on Architecture of a Digital Library System, Knowbots and
Their Applications, Implementation Plan)

7. Markoff, John, "For PC's, a New Class of Software," _New York Times_,
D6 (Metropolitan)/C6(National), 8 March 1989.  (discusses "knowledge
daemons," a.k.a. knowbots)

8. Markoff, John, "Creating a Giant Computer Highway," _New York Times_,
Business Section (3), p. 1., 2 September 1990. (discusses NSF/DOD
contract to Corp. for National Research Initiatives for research in
high-speed computer networks, including a few comments about knowbots)

9. Steinberg, Don, "Demon Knowbots," _PC-Computing_, 3(1):135-135,
January 1990. (discusses how a knowbot might work, mentions some
companies involved, e.g., Locus Computing Corp.)

_Science_, 248:674-675, 11 May 1990.  (discusses issues related to
locating/accessing scientific data on distributed network, including 5-6
paragraphs about possible use of knowbots)

Somewhere along the way, I picked up a net address to access a knowbot.
I don't remember where I saw it, but if you try
    telnet nri.reston.va.us 185
you reach a knowbot service.

I wasn't particularly happy with what I could get out of this knowbot. I
found NetFind more interesting.  Maybe knowbots have to evolve.
