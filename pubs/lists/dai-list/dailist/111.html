1) D. COCKBURN, L. Z. VARGA and N. R. JENNINGS (1992) "Cooperating
Intelligent Systems for Electricity Distribution", Proc. Expert Systems
1992 (Applications Track), Cambridge, UK. 

This paper describes the CIDIM (Cooperating Intelligent Systems for
DIstribution System Management) application in which a set of
conventional and A.I programs work together as an aid to the control
engineer. It will perform such tasks as fault diagnosis, lightning
location, user driven switch planning, safety checking, security
analysis and will collate the information produced by the various
systems for display on a graphical user interface. The communication and
cooperation necessary between the systems will be achieved by using the
results of the ARCHON project.


2) N. R. JENNINGS (1992) "On Being Responsible" in Decentralized A. I. 3,
(eds. E. Werner & Y. Demazeau), North Holland Publishers, 93-102. 

Joint responsibility is a mental and behavioural state which captures
and formalizes many of the intuitive underpinnings of collaborative
problem solving. It defines the preconditions which must hold before
such activity can commence, how individuals should behave (in their own
problem solving and towards others) once such problem solving has begun
and minimum conditions which group participants must satisfy.


3) N. R. JENNINGS (1992) "A Knowledge Level Approach to Collaborative
Problem Solving", Proc. AAAI Workshop on Cooperation Among Heterogeneous
Intelligent Agents, San Jose, USA, 55-64.

This paper proposes, characterizes and outlines the benefits of a new
computer level specifically for multiagent problem solvers. This level
is called the cooperation knowledge level and involves describing and
developing richer and more explicit models of common social phenomena.
We then focus on one particular form of social interaction in which
groups of agents decide they wish to work together, in a collaborative
manner, to tackle a common problem. A domain independent model (called
joint responsibility) is developed to describe how participants should
behave during such problem solving. Particular emphasis is placed on the
problem of ensuring coherent behaviour in the face of unpredictable and
dynamic environments. The utility of this model is highlighted in the
real-world environment of electricity transportation management. In this
domain, agents have to make decisions using partial, imprecise views of
the system and the inherent dynamics of the problem mean that team
members have to continually evaluate the ongoing problem solving
process. Joint responsibility provides the evaluation criteria and the
causal link to behaviour upon which individual and social situation
assessment is based


4) N. R. JENNINGS (1992) "Towards a Cooperation Knowledge Level for
Collaborative Problem Solving", Proc. 10th European Conference on
Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, Austria, 224-228.

The cooperation knowledge level is a new computer level specifically for
multiagent problem solvers which describes rich and explicit models of
common social phenomena. A cooperation level description (called joint
responsibility) is developed to describe how participants should behave
during interactions in which groups of agents collaborate to solve a
common problem. The utility of this model is highlighted in the
real-world environment of electricity transport management in which
agents have to make decisions using partial, imprecise views of the
system and cope with the inherent dynamics of the environment. In such
situations the tracking of social action becomes a primary
consideration; joint responsibility provides evaluation criteria and the
causal link to behaviour upon which such assessment can be based.


5) N. R. JENNINGS (1992) "Using GRATE to Build Cooperating Agents for
Industrial Control", Proc. IFAC/IFIP/IMACS International Symposium on
Artificial Intelligence in Real Time Control, Delft, The Netherlands, 691-696.

Communities of cooperating problem solvers have recently begun to emerge
as a paradigm for overcoming the complexity of building large software
systems in the area of process control. Each agent is capable of solving
some problems by itself, but its power can be extended by sharing
information and tasks with others. Also, more importantly, the community
as a whole exhibits some desirable problem solving characteristics (eg
graceful degradation of performance, robustness, etc.) as well as
offering the opportunity of connecting and integrating existing problem
solvers.  GRATE is a general purpose cooperation environment which
enables groups of interacting problem solvers to be built for the domain
of industrial control. It has been applied to two real-world problems in
this area:  electricity transport management and diagnosis in a particle
accelerator beam controller. We reflect upon GRATE's functional
architecture, its underlying principles and the insights gained during
this process.


6) N. R. JENNINGS and E. H. MAMDANI (1992) "Using Joint Responsibility to
Coordinate Collaborative Problem Solving in Dynamic Environments", Proc of
Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, San Jose, USA,
269-275. 

Joint responsibility is a new metalevel description of how cooperating
agents should behave when engaged in collaborative problem solving. It
is independent of any specific planning or consensus forming mechanism,
but can be mapped down to such a level. An application of the framework
to the real world problem of electricity transportation management is
given and its implementation is discussed. A comparative analysis of
responsibility and two other group organisational structures, selfish
problem solvers and communities in which collaborative behaviour emerges
from interactions, is undertaken. The aim being to evaluate their
relative performance characteristics in dynamic and unpredictable
environments in which decisions are taken using partial, imprecise views
of the system.


7) N. R. JENNINGS, E. H. MAMDANI, I. LARESGOITI, J. PEREZ and J. CORERA
(1992) "GRATE: A General Framework for Cooperative Problem Solving"
Journal of Intelligent Systems Engineering, 1 (2) 102-114.

As the deployment of expert systems has spread into more complex and
sophisticated environments, so inherent technological limitations have
been observed. As a technique for overcoming this complexity barrier,
researchers have started to build systems composed of multiple,
cooperating components. These systems tend to fall into two distinct
categories: systems which solve a particular problem, such as speech
recognition or vehicle monitoring, and systems which are general to some
extent. GRATE is a general framework which enables an application
builder to construct multiagent systems for the domain of industrial
process control. Unlike other cooperation frameworks, GRATE embodies a
significant amount of inbuilt knowledge related to cooperation and
control which can be utilised during system building. This approach
offers a paradigm shift for the construction of multiagent systems in
which the role of configuring preexisting knowledge becomes an integral
component. Rather than starting from scratch the designer can utilise
the inbuilt knowledge and augment it, if necessary, with domain specific
information. The GRATE architecture has a clear separation of concerns
and has been applied to real-world problems in the domains of
electricity transportation management and diagnosis of a particle
accelerator beam controller.

(1993), "Transforming Standalone Expert Systems into a Community of
Cooperating Agents", Int. Journal of Engineering Application of Artificial
Intelligence (to appear). 

Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) systems in which multiple
problem solving agents cooperate to achieve a common objective is a
rapidly emerging and promising technology. However, as yet, there have
been relatively few reported cases of such systems being employed to
tackle real-world problems in realistic domains. One of the reasons for
this is that DAI researchers have given virtually no consideration to
the process of incorporating preexisting systems into a community of
cooperating agents. Yet reuse is a primary consideration for any
organisation with a large software base.
  To redress the balance, this paper reports on an experiment undertaken
at the CERN laboratories in which two pre-existing and standalone expert
systems for diagnosing faults in a particle accelerator were transformed
into a community of cooperating agents. The experiences and insights
gained during this process provide a valuable first step towards
satisfying the needs of potential users of DAI technology - identifying
the types of changes required for cooperative problem solving,
quantifying the effort involved in transforming standalone systems to
ones suitable for cooperation and highlighting the benefits of a
cooperating systems approach in a realistic industrial application.

Distributed Artificial Intelligence: Theory and Praxis (eds. N. M. Avouris
and L.Gasser), Kluwer Academic Press 179-195.

This paper describes the state of the ARCHON project at its halfway
stage.  It outlines why a Distributed AI approach is appropriate for
large industrial applications, the benefits which accrue and highlights
those domain characteristics which have had significant bearing on the
design process. The ARCHON functional architecture is described and a
clear mapping with the design forces is made. The problem of
constructing a general architecture which is sufficiently powerful for
real-size applications is raised and two mechanisms used within ARCHON
for achieving this objective are identified. The first mechanism is to
combine generic, declarative knowledge related to cooperation and
control with situated action formalisms which are tailored to the
particular application. The second approach is to provide general
structures which can be instantiated with domain specific information.

10) N. R. JENNINGS, (1993), "Coordination = Commitment + Conventions", KEAG
Group Technical Report (submitted for publication). 

Distributed Artificial Intelligence systems, in which multiple agents
interact to improve their individual performance and to enhance the
system's overall utility, are becoming an increasingly pervasive means
of conceptualising a diverse range of applications. As the discipline
matures, researchers are beginning to strive for the underlying theories
and principles which guide the central processes of coordination and
cooperation. Here it is argued that commitments (pledges to undertake a
specified course of action) and their associated conventions (means of
monitoring commitments in a changing environment) are the foundation of
coordination in multiagent systems.  Having highlighted the necessity of
commitments and conventions, a review of several coordination models
which explicitly use these concepts offers some insights into how they
can be encoded in a formal framework. Finally three of the most
prominent coordination mechanisms, which do not explicitly involve
commitments or conventions, are reformulated in these terms to
demonstrate their compliance with the central hypothesis of this paper.

Dear Colleague,
 
You may be interested in the following joint GERMAN / UK CSCW SIG
Seminar aiming at the foundations of a multidisciplinary, integrated
theory of coordination.
 
			  Call For Papers
	TOWARDS THE INTELLIGENT FIRM: THE COORDINATION PERSPECTIVE
		  A Joint GERMAN / UK CSCW SIG Seminar

			Department of Trade & Industry
	      Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1
			   Monday 6th December 1993

Making human organizations more intelligent as they currently are is
perhaps one the most important challenges of organizational research
and information systems development today.  New approaches in
organizational theory do emphasize the need for downsizing and
decentralization of organizations. This causes the delegation of tasks,
competences and responsibilities and introduces (partial) autonomy to
deeper levels of organizational hierarchies.Recent work on information
system technology has already begun to develop different approaches to
cooperative computing such as Computer Supported Cooperative Work,
Man-Computer-Cooperation, Distributed Artificial Intelligence, and
Nonstandard Database Management Systems for teamwork applications.

No longer can such organizations be regarded as collections of personel
organized into some appropriate structure so as to facilitate control /
coordination between them. Interactions within organizations take place
increasingly between human-computer and computer-computer entities and
as such these need to be controlled and supported effectively. In order
to achieve this goal a truly integrated theory of coordination needs to
be developed.

Within this context the seminar aims at the theoretical foundations of
an integrated theory of coordination. Thus, it shall integrate existing
issues within the coordination debate. It will enhance our
understanding of these elements and their interrelationships. It will
synthesize disparate work identifying the key elements of an integrated
theory of coordination. To this end the seminar will take an
interdisciplinary approach based on work in social science,
organizational theory, CSCW, Distributed AI, and database support for
teamwork applications.

Papers are solicitated on the following and related areas:

o    Integrated and Interdisciplinary Theory of Coordination

o    Cooperation and Coordination in Human Organizations

o    Human Computer Cooperation and Coordination

o    Interaction among different coordination mechanisms (e.g., 
        between the different human and software agent levels)

o    Cooperation and Coordination between Software Systems 

o    Database Support for Teamwork Applications on either the Human   
     or the Software Level

Papers may be scientific papers focusing on a particular issue, or they
may provide thorough overviews from the current state of the art in one
or several of the above mentioned fields.

Format:

It is intended to publish the seminar proceedings in the BCS CSCW book
series on CSCW, and a full length paper will be required for this.
Contributions should be submitted in double spaced format,
approximately 4000 words.  In order to save efforts: anyone interested

Subject: CFP: 2nd Inter'l. Workshop on Robot & Human Comm. (RO-MAN '93)

CALL FOR PAPERS

RO-MAN '93 TOKYO
The IEEE 2nd International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication
Session on Emotional Communication and Dialogue in Virtual Realities
Session moderator:  John K. Myers

November 3-5, 1993
Science University of Tokyo,   Tokyo, Japan

  Recently many researchers have begun to work with autonomous agents in
artificial realities.  The most challenging research in this area
focuses not only on single autonomous agents interacting with their
worlds, but also on multiple autonomous agents communicating with each
other through dialogues and emotional signals.  What are these systems
capable of doing?  What algorithms and operators are necessary?  Where
will such systems go in the future?
  Human users are also experimenting with communication in virtual
realities.  The recent popular Multiple User Dungeon (MUD) programs
provide a way for users to interact with each other in a new mode of
communication.  What are the topics of these interactions?  What kinds
of dialogue patterns and strategies for emotional communication are
used?
  A few leading-edge researchers are also exploring the problem of how a
robotic intelligence can communicate with a human user.  How does
dialogue generation work?  What primitives are used for emotional
communication?  How can these be recognized or generated?  Real-world
psychological problems include what kinds of commands are used when
talking with an autonomous agent (e.g., the "Knowledge Navigator"), and
how do people feel when talking to or with agents.
  In the not-so-distant future, a virtual-reality interface to normal
computers, intelligent computer agents, and to other users (the
palantir telephone/TV) may be commonplace.  What knowledge
technologies will be required to achieve full communication?  How will
these be used?  What problems will occur?

This session attempts to advance the state of the art by providing a
platform to disseminate cutting-edge and futuristic research on these
topics.  Papers should emphasize the theoretical aspects of
communication, including but not limited to ontologies of emotional and
informative communicative acts, theories of emotions and of dialogue,
algorithms for recognition, generation, and interaction, psychological
studies, etc., etc.  Speculations and projections of what this
technology will lead to in the future are encouraged.  Papers on
implemented systems, and actual experiments, as well as position papers
and well-thought-out theoretical designs are all welcomed.

Please submit five copies of an extended summary of 300-600 words,
together with one or two figures that best illustrate your work, to:
  John K. Myers
  American Film Technologies
  11585 Sorrento Valley Road
  San Diego, CA  
  92121   USA
to be received on or before May 3rd, 1993.  Rough drafts of papers are
also welcome at this point.  Applicants will be notified of acceptance
or rejection by the end of June.  Successful applicants will be
requested to submit a final draft of 8 pages or less by August 28th.
The official language of the workshop is English.  A proceedings will be
published and distributed at the workshop.

If you are even thinking of possibly submitting an extended summary, I
ask that you send your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail
address to:  myers@atr-la.atr.co.jp before March 24th if possible.  I am
relocating, and this will aid in communication.
