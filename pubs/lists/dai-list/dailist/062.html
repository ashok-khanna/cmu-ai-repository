TOWARD AN INTERDISCIPLINARY THEORY OF COORDINATION

Thomas W. Malone and Kevin Crowston

(MIT Center for Coordination Science Technical Report No. 120, April 
1991)

This paper characterizes a new research area, called coordination
theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination.
Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from
disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations
research, economics, linguistics, and psychology.

In the framework presented here, coordination is analyzed in terms of
actors performing interdependent activities that achieve goals.  A
variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective and
commonalities across disciplines are identified.  Processes analyzed
include goal decomposition, resource allocation, synchronization, group
decision-making, communication, and the perception of common objects.

A major section of the paper summarizes recent applications of
coordination theory in three different domains:  (1) understanding the
effects of information technology on human organizations and markets,
(2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and
parallel processing computer systems.  In the final section of the
paper, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly
outlined.

Subject: Simulating Societies Symposium (second call)

Second Call for Participation

Symposium on SIMULATING SOCIETIES

2-3 April 1992
Guildford, Surrey, UK

Although the value of simulating complex phenomena in order to come to a
better understanding of their nature is well recognised, it is still
rare for simulation to be used to understand social processes.  This
symposium is intended to review current ideas on simulating social
processes, compare alternative approaches and suggest directions for
future work.

It is expected that about a dozen papers will be presented to the
symposium and that revised versions will be published as a text on
social simulation.  We are now seeking proposals for the papers and for
participation in the symposium.

Papers on the following and related topics are invited:

*  Discussions of approaches to simulation of social processes such as
those based on distributed artificial intelligence, non-linear systems,
general purpose stochastic simulation systems etc.

*  Accounts of specific simulations of processes and phenomena, at macro
or micro level.

*  Critical reviews of existing work that has involved the simulation of
social processes.

*  Reviews of simulation work in archeology, economics, psychology,
geography, etc. with lessons for the simulation of social processes.

*  Arguments for or against simulation as an approach to understanding
complex social processes.

'Social process' may be interpreted widely to include, for example, the
rise and fall of nation states, the behaviour of households, and social
interaction.

Participants' registration, accommodation and subsistence expenses
during the meeting will be met by the University of Surrey Department of
Sociology.   The assistance of the Johnson Wax Foundation is gratefully
acknowledged.  Participants will need to find their own travel expenses.

Proposals for papers are initially invited in the form of abstracts of
no more than 300 words.  Abstracts should be sent, along with a brief
statement of research interests, by 30th November 1991.  Authors of
those selected will be invited to submit full papers by 15th February,
1992.  Those interested in participating, but not wishing to present a
paper, should send a letter including brief details of their research
and the contribution they could make to the symposium, also by 30th
November, 1991.

The organisers of the Symposium are Jim Doran, Department of Computer
Science, University of Essex, Nigel Seel, Bell Northern Research Ltd,
and Nigel Gilbert, Department of Sociology, University of Surrey.

The symposium is the latest in a series of Surrey Conferences on
Sociological Theory and Method begun in 1981, which have explored
growing points in the discipline. Most of the symposia have resulted in
monographs; titles include Accounts and Action, Social Action and
Artificial Intelligence, Longitudinal Data Analysis, Sequence Analysis,
and Actions and Structure.

The Surrey campus is located in Guildford, a cathedral city 30 miles
southwest of London.  It is within 20 miles of both London airports and
35 minutes by train from London's Waterloo station.

Proposals should be sent by post, fax or email to:
Prof Nigel Gilbert, Department of Sociology,
University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, 
United Kingdom.
