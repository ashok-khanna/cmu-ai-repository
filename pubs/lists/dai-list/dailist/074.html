Subject: Real-Life Applications of DAI within the Industry?

Dear colleagues,

An industrial friend is looking for real-life applications (not testbeds
or prototypes) using Distributed AI (CDPS, multiagent systems) within
the industry in USA, Europe, or Japan.  If you have any information or
pointer, please Email them directly to me and I'll forward to the
concerned person.

                                  MAAMAW '92

                         Fourth European Workshop on
              Modeling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World

                               July, 29-31 1992
                    S.Martino al Cimino (near Rome), Italy

                               CALL FOR PAPERS

The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multiagent systems.  MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies.  While classical DAI research was mainly
concerned with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view
of a common goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several
autonomous agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and
abilities, share a common environment and pursue either shared or
competing goals.  MAAMAW is therefore interested both in classical DAI
problems (coordination, communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.)
and in theories of intention and action, or, more generally, in the
architecture of the autonomous agent.  Multiagent models are a new area
of research in rapid growth, of relevant interest both for AI and for
social and management sciences.  Both novel theoretical and
computational approaches to multiagent topics are encouraged.  The
submitted papers will undergo a strict selection.  MAAMAW is a 60-person
international workshop where you can discuss your ideas or exhibit your
systems.

Topics of MAAMAW interest include, but are not limited to:
          * Agents architectures (high level, reactive, situated
            agents)
          * Artificial life from a multiagent perspective
          * Cooperation, coordination, and conflict
          * Communication (protocols, linguistic strategies,
            negotiation approaches)
          * Distributed multiagent planning and group work
          * Distributed algorithms for multiagent interactions
          * Learning of cooperation and coordination
          * Hardware based on a multiagent perspective
          * Multiagent testbeds for simulating multiagent
            interactions
          * Formal specification and verification of agents and
            systems of agents
          * Conceptual and theoretical foundations of multiagent
            systems

This year the workshop will focus on:

          *** SOCIAL SIMULATION ***

with special reference to:
          * Social organization, social roles, norms
          * Power and influence between agents
          * Collective agents, joint intentions, commitment,
            responsibility in social action
          * DAI and the Multi-Agent perspective for the social
            sciences

Preprints of the proceedings will be available at the workshop.  Papers
from the proceedings will be revised and appear in a book of the
''Decentralized AI'' series published by Elsevier/North Holland.
