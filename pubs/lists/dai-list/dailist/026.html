Subject: DAI Research at AAII

The Australian Artifical Intelligence Institute (AAII) is involved in
various aspects of DAI research, including theoretical foundations,
system implementations, experimental simulation, and applications of
DAI.
 
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 
Research in this area is focused on the formalizations of a single
agent's mental state in terms of his beliefs, goals, actions, intentions
and commitment.  The role played by decision theory in the deliberative
process and its influence on the formation and revision of intentions
and goals is also being examined.

An extension of this enterprise is the formalization of the mental state
of a group of agents.  This involves notions such as mutual beliefs,
joint goals, social actions, group intentions and joint commitment.  The
latter is being examined with respect to different organisational
structures.

With the above formalizations we are developing representations for
global multiagent plans.  The primary aim of this work is to develop
techniques for collaborative planning among a group of agents and the
associated communication and synchronisation required.
 
SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION 
The collaborative planning system is to be based on the existing
embedded real-time reasoning system -- the Procedural Reasoning System
(PRS).  The philosophy of PRS, namely that agents do not plan from
scratch but rather carry situation-specific plans that are instantiated
and executed partially at the appropriate time, is carried through in
the multiagent case.  Thus, groups of agents have global plans which are
adopted and executed when the group has the appropriate mutual beliefs
and joint goals.  The system will be written in Common Lisp.

EXPERIMENTAL SIMULATION
Recent work has employed a simulated environment to explore the
interaction between agent and environment characteristics,
concentrating particularly on the role of intentions and commitment in
producing effective agent behaviour.  This approach will be extended to
multiagent domains, permitting experimental investigation of the effects
of different organisational structures and reflective and cooperative
strategies upon individual and group effectiveness.

APPLICATIONS 
Some of the above DAI research will be applied to real-world domains.
In particular work will be carried out on the following two projects:

Distributed Air-Traffic Management System 
-----------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype distributed reasoning
system that will coordinate the air-traffic within a group of airports
and the associated air-space.  Thus the air traffic management systems
at the different airports have to cooperate with each other and revise
their respective schedules so as to globally maximize the utilisation of
the entire air-traffic network.

The project is an extension of work currently being done for the Civil
Aviation Authority of Australia on a single airport air-traffic flow
management system.
 
Beyond-Visual-Range Air Combat Modelling
----------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to model individual and team tactics of
combat aircraft under different scenarios; namely, varying opposition
team tactics and weapons capabilities and varying the
certainty/uncertainty of the information available. The emphasis will be
on team tactics along with the dynamic reorganisation of teams and the
dynamic change of roles among the team members.
 
This is a joint project with the Australian Defense Science and
Technology Organisation's Aeronautical Research Laboratories.
 
Apart from the above DAI projects which have recently commenced, the
Institute has been working on multiagent embedded real-time systems over
the past couple of years.  Although not strictly DAI, (because the
global communication/ synchronisation/negotiation is hard-wired and
developed by the application developers) the following projects use a
multiagent architecture that might be of some interest to the DAI
community.
 
OASIS (Optimal Aircraft Sequencing Using Intelligent Search)
------------------------------------------------------------
This prototype system is designed to perform air-traffic flow management
for Australia's Sydney airport.  It monitors the progress of aircraft
destined to Sydney, sequences them based on different criteria and
operating conditions, and issues directives to the controllers to
implement these sequences.  It monitors these sequences in real-time and
revises them when necessary.  Thus it is a real-time embedded reasoning
and scheduling system.

OASIS is based on a multiagent architecture with one aircraft agent for
each aircraft (approximately 50 aircrafts at any one time) and a number
of global agents including the sequencer, wind manager, coordinator, and
trajectory checker.  While each aircraft agent models the flight of an
individual aircraft, the global agents are responsible for the global
tasks of sequencing, feedback and monitoring.

The system is currently running under a simulated environment and is
expected to be trialed at Sydney airport in June 1991.
 
IRTNMS (Interactive Real-Time Network Management System)
-------------------------------------------------------- 
This prototype system developed for Telecom Australia manages the
telephone network in real-time.  It receives raw data about different
parameters from the network in real-time and diagnoses different types
of problems.  The system then suggests and implements different control
measures to reduce or remove these problems.  It also continuously
monitors these control measures suggesting the increase, decrease or
removal of various control measures.
 
The system is once again based on a multiagent architecture with three
agents:  the DIAGNOSIS agent responsible for diagnosing problems, the
CONTROLS agent responsible for taking control measures, and the MONITOR
agent responsible for monitoring the status of the network and the
control measures.  All three agents operate in parallel, with possibly
different sets of data, and share information by message passing.

Real-Time Diagnosis for the Space Shuttle's Reaction Control System (RCS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RCS system was developed for NASA jointly at SRI International and
AAII.  It is an embedded reasoning system which monitors alarms,
diagnoses problems, and suggests corrective measures for the reaction
control system of the Space Shuttle.  The system has two agents: the
INTERFACE agent, which performs the low-level monitoring of temperatures
and pressures and the RCS agent, which is responsible for the high-level
diagnosis.
 
Anyone interested in obtaining more details about the above projects can
get in touch with me.  Some of the above mentioned work has been
published in conferences and the others are at different stages of
development.
