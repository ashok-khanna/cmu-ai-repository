          =========================

   The German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) at 
Saarbruecken invites applications for research positions in the project 
"AKA-Mod" (Modeling Cooperative Agents).
   The aims of the project are to study various aspects of distributed AI 
systems in the context of concrete application scenarios and to develop a 
testbed for multiagent systems.
   The ideal candidate has an excellent education in Computer Science 
(especially AI), research experience or good knowledge in the field of 
DAI, programming experience (LISP, PROLOG), and experience with 
Symbolics-LISP machines and SUN networks.
   Experience with the German Language might be good, but is not a must.
