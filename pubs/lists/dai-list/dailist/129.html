Subject: CFP 2nd Feature Interaction Workshop
Date: Thu, 29 Jul 1993 11:56:49 +0200 (MET DST)

Included is a Call for Participation for the 2nd International Workshop
on Feature Interactions in Telecommunications Software Systems. This CFP
is posted here since Distributed Artificial Intelligence has been shown
to provide useful technology for solving part of the feature-interaction
problem, and the organizers of the workshop would welcome further
contributions from that field.

Further information on the feature-interaction problem can be obtained
from several papers in the August issues of IEEE Computer and IEEE
Communications Magazine.  One paper in that issue of Computer deals with
the relation between DAI and the feature-interaction problem
specifically.  An abstract for that paper is also included.  Please
contact me if you want additional information on the relation between
DAI and the feature-interaction problem.

           Distributed Artificial Intelligence for
           Run-Time Feature-Interaction Resolution
			Hugo Velthuijsen 

ABSTRACT
A feature in a telecommunications system is a package of functionality
incrementally added to a service to enhance or modify it. A feature may
interact with its environment in a way that interferes with the
feature's desired operation. A feature's environment may include the
telecommunications system, other features and services, as well as other
instances of the same feature. The feature-interaction problem deals
with the detection, prevention, and resolution of undesired feature
interactions.

The feature-interaction problem has many different instances. This
article argues that some instances lend themselves to a distributed
artificial intelligence approach. The use of DAI techniques in current
telecommunications systems appears quite natural in light of two trends
in the way these systems are designed: the distribution of functionality
and the incorporation of "intelligence".

There are two basic ways to introduce agents into a telecommunications
system. In certain cases, it is feasible to encapsulate services or
features in agents. DAI techniques for dealing with interactions among
agents can than be used to detect and deal with interactions among the
encapsulated services or features. Agents can also be used to represent
a user's or network provider's notion of what is "desirable" operation
of services and features. DAI negotiation techniques may help in finding
an acceptable way to operate when conflicts arise over what is
desirable.

The author illustrates the relevance of DAI techniques to the
feature-interaction problem by discussing existing work (LODES,
TEAM-CPS, Multistage Negotiation, and Negotiating Agents) that addresses
one or more instances of the problem. Additionally, he identifies the
kind of cooperation and coordination that the feature-interaction
problem requires and the interesting research problems it poses to the
field of distributed artificial intelligence.

	  Second International Workshop on Feature Interactions
		  in Telecommunications Software Systems
			Amsterdam, The Netherlands
			      May 9-10, 1994
    
			       DESCRIPTION
    
This workshop is the second in a series, whose mission is to encourage
researchers from a variety of computer science specialties (software
engineering, protocol engineering, distributed artificial intel-
ligence, formal techniques, software testing, and distributed systems,
among others) to apply their techniques to the feature interaction
problem that arises in building telecommunications software systems (see
the back page for a description of the problem).  We welcome papers on
avoiding, detecting, and/or resolving feature interactions using either
analytical or structural approaches.  Submissions are encouraged in (but
are not limited to) the following topic areas:
  - Classification of feature interactions.
  - Modeling, reasoning, and testing techniques for detecting feature
    interactions. 
  - Software platforms and architecture designs  to aid in avoiding,
    detecting, and resolving feature interactions.
  - Tools and methodologies for promoting software compatibility and 
    extensibility.
  - Mechanisms for managing feature interactions throughout the
    service life-cyle.
  - Management of feature interactions in PCS, ISDN, and Broadband
    services, as well as IN services.  
  - Management of feature interactions in various of the operations
    support functions such as Service Negotiation, Service Management,
    and Service Assurance.
  - Feature Interactions and their potential impact on system Security 
    and Safety. 
  - Environments and automated tools for related problems in other
    software systems. 
  - Management of Feature Interactions in various proposed
    architectures such as TMN, INA, ROSA, CASSIOPEIA, SERENITE, or
    PLATINA.

				  FORMAT
We hope to promote a dialogue among researchers in various related
areas, as well as the designers and builders of telecommunications
software.  To this end, the workshop will have sessions for paper
presentations, including relatively long discussion periods.  Panel
discussions and tool demonstrations are also planned.

				ATTENDANCE
Workshop attendance will be limited to 90 people. Attendance will be by
invitation only. Prospective attendees are asked to submit either a
paper (maximum 5000 words) or a single page description of their
interests and how they relate to the workshop. About 16-20 of the

			    WORKSHOP STATEMENT

The feature interaction problem has been a major obstacle to the rapid
deployment of new telephone services.  Telecommunications software is
huge, real-time, and distributed; adding new features to a
telecommunication system, like adding new functionalities to any large
software system, can be very difficult.  Each new feature may interact
with many existing features, causing customer annoyance or total system
breakdown.  Traditionally, interactions were detected and resolved on a
feature by feature basis by experts who are knowledgeable on all
existing features.  As the number of features grows to satisfy diverse
needs of customers, managing feature interactions in a single
administrative domain is approaching incomprehensible complexity.  In a
future marketplace where features deployed in the network may be
developed by different operating companies and their associated vendors,
the traditional approach is no longer feasible.  How to detect, resolve,
or even prevent the occurrence of feature interactions in an open
network becomes an important research issue.

The feature interaction problem is not unique to telecommunications
software; similar problems are encountered in any long-lived software
system that requires frequent changes and additions to its
functionality.  Techniques in many related areas appear to be applicable
to the management of feature interactions.  Software methodologies for
extensibility and compatibility, for example, could be useful for
providing a structured design that can prevent many feature interactions
from occurring.  Formal specification, verification, and testing
techniques, being widely used in protocol engineering and software
engineering, contribute a lot to the detection of interactions.  Several
causes of the problem, such as aliasing, timing, and the distribution of
software components, are similar to issues in distributed systems.
Cooperative problem solving, a promising approach for resolving
interactions at run time, resembles distributed planning and resolution
of conflicting subgoals among multiple agents in the area of distributed
artificial intelligence. This workshop aims to provide an opportunity
for participants to share ideas and experiences in their respective
fields, and to apply their expertise to the feature interaction problem.

Background

In CKBS, a number of intelligent computer systems cooperate together to
solve problems that cannot be solved otherwise. These applied multiagent
systems can be described as the next generation of intelligent systems,
with a wide range of industrial application domains, such as air traffic
control, telecommunications network management, distributed sensor
networks, intelligent manufacturing systems, and so on. The focus of
research into CKBS is the blending of techniques from distributed
artificial intelligence and distributed databases to provide good
solutions to real-world problems.

The first international conference on this theme was CKBS'90 held at
Keele in October 1990 and was considered by the participants as being a
valuable forum for the cross fertilisation of ideas. Following which an
international special interest group, CKBS-SIG was formed (managed by
the DAKE Centre at Keele) to provide a nucleus for further activities in
this arena.

Last September the DAKE Centre organised, on behalf of the SIG, the 1992
UK workshop on CKBS to provide a meeting place for researchers from
academia and industry. This workshop proved very successful with plenty
of discussion among the delegates. The proceedings from which have
recently been published (ISBN: 0 952 1789 0 7) and can be obtained from
the DAKE Centre for 9.95 pounds.

Attendance at the 1993 workshop is welcome from all members of the SIG,
as well as from other interested researchers. The activity committee of
the workshop consists of:
	Prof. S. M. Deen (Keele University)  [Chairman]
	Prof. J. Doran (University of Essex)
	Mr. D. Griffiths (British Telecom)
	Dr. P. Kearney (Sharp Laboratories, Europe)
