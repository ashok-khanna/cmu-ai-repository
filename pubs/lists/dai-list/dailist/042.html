                        Call for Participation

  11th International Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence

                            The Homestead
               Glen Arbor, Michigan (near Traverse City)

                         February 26-28, 1992

Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with how a
decentralized group of intelligent computational agents should
coordinate their activities to achieve their goals.  When pursuing
common or overlapping goals, they should act cooperatively so as to
accomplish more as a group than individually; when pursuing conflicting
goals, they should compete intelligently.  The 11th Workshop on
Distributed Artificial Intelligence will bring together researchers
studying coordination from diverse perspectives, ranging from
distributed computing systems to discourse analysis, from formalisms for
representing nested beliefs in agents to cognitive studies of human
performance in organizations, from solving inherently distributed
problems in applications such as communication network managment to
analyzing the evolution of cooperation in populations of artificial
systems.  The objective is to identify and develop common theories and
approaches to coordination in order to improve our conceptual
understandings and practical implementations of coordination processes.

Participation at the Workshop will be by invitation only and will be
limited to approximately 40 people.  To participate, please submit a
technical paper describing original research or significant applications
in DAI to the Workshop chairman.  Preference will be given to work that
addresses one or more of the four DAI themes listed below.  We
specifically discourage the submission of papers in areas such as
fine-grained parallelism, hardware or language-level concurrency, and
connectionism, because we feel that work in these areas is more
appropriate for other workshops.  A small number of "interested
observers" may also be invited to attend.  If you would like to be
considered for attendance on this basis, please submit a written request
justifying your participation.

To encourage participants to relate their work to ongoing themes in DAI
beforehand, papers are solicited for (but not strictly limited to) the
following themes:

1.  Coordination/Collaboration Knowledge: The identification, encoding,
and use of generic knowledge for coordination and collaboration.  This
theme focusses on general knowledge about resolving conflicts,
compromising, and cooperating.

2.  Coordination as Search: When viewing coordination as a search
process, decisions are needed regarding algorithms for conducting the
search, heuristics for controlling the search, and protocols for
exchanging and updating portions of the search space.  This theme
broadly includes approaches such as distributed constraint satisfaction
search, search for compatible distributed plans, search in cooperative
problem-solving and design, negotiation search, and search for
appropriate organizational designs.

3.  Intelligent Agents in Enterprises and Applications: Embedding DAI
systems in computer networks used by people to solve problems allows the
automation of both cooperative problem-solving activities (such as
distributed interpretation or diagnosis) and coordination activities
(such as information filtration or resource allocation).  This theme
includes issues in identifying suitable applications of DAI technology
and in developing DAI agents that interact effectively with people and
each other.

4.  Modeling Through Communication and Observation in Adversarial and
Cooperative Systems: Building and maintaining models of other agents'
beliefs, abilities, goals, and plans is crucial for intelligent
interaction.  Topics in this theme include acquiring modeling
information (through communication and plan recognition) and using
models to make decisions about communication (deciding whether to tell
the truth, eliciting more information) and about other actions.

These themes are not mutually exclusive, and we welcome papers that
integrate insights from more than one of them.

As DAI matures, it is appearing more and more in real-world
applications.  This welcome development raises the need for engineering
principles that will help match particular techniques with kinds of
problems.  We welcome both theoretical and applied papers, and encourage
each to contribute to the development of these principles.
Specifically, theoretical papers should explain how their principles and
methods can be mapped to applications, while applied papers should
explain why they use the techniques that they do and why other
approaches are less appropriate for the problem at hand.

The Workshop will have several types of sessions, including presentation
sessions for discussion of distinguished papers, panel discussions for
papers sharing common themes, and working sessions on topics such as
unifying concepts behind coordination, and methodologies and evaluation
criteria for DAI research.

VENUE:

DAI'92 will be held at the Homestead in Glen Arbor, Michigan, 27 miles
from the Traverse City airport, on the shore of Lake Michigan and
adjacent to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  Sculpted by
glaciers and hundreds of feet in height, the dunes border the western
edge of the peninsula the Chippewa called "Leelanau," "the land of
delight." The environment is richly forested and surrounded with relics
of frontier America, and the resort has on-site ice skating, down-hill
skiing, and cross-country trailheads to 36 kilometers of trails through
the National Lakeshore (with equipment rental and instruction
available). We'll continue the DAI tradition of a participatory workshop
by active practitioners in a setting that offers seclusion, natural
beauty, and recreational intermissions.

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Papers for review should be a maximum length of 10 pages, in a legible
format.  Please submit 4 copies to Edmund H. Durfee (address below), and
indicate on the title page the theme(s) for which the paper is most
relevant.  Also, please include an electronic mail address for the
appropriate contact person.

DATES:

Deadline for paper submissions (4 copies, 10 page max):November 1, 1991.

Notification of acceptance:                           December 16, 1991.

Final papers due (for distribution at the Workshop):   January 17, 1992. 

We expect that revised versions of the best papers from the Workshop
will be considered for inclusion in an appropriate journal or in a
published collection.

GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION
edited by Melvin F. Shakun, New York University

The idea for the journal, Group Decision and Negotiation, emerges from
evolving, unifying approaches to group decision and negotiation
processes.  These processes are complex and self-organizing involving
multiplayer, multicriteria, ill-structured, dynamic problems. Approaches
include (1) computer group decision and negotiation support, (2)
artificial intelligence and management science, (3) applied game theory,
experiment and social choice, and (4) cognitive/behavioral sciences in
group decision and negotiation. A number of research studies combines
two or more of these fields. The new journal provides a publication
vehicle for theoretical and empirical research, and real-world
applications and case studies.

In defining the domain of group decision and negotiation, the term
"group" is interpreted to comprise all multiplayer contexts. Thus,
organizational decision support systems providing organization-wide
support are included.  Group decision and negotiation refers to the
whole process or flow of activities relevant to group decision and
negotiation, not only to the final choice itself -- e.g., scanning,
communication and information sharing, problem definition
(representation) and evolution, alternative generation and
social-emotional interaction. Descriptive, normative and design
viewpoints are of interest. Thus, Group Decision and Negotiation deals
broadly with relation and coordination in group processes.

Areas of application include intraorganizational coordination (as in
integrated design, production, finance, marketing and distribution,
--e.g., as in new products and global coordination), computer supported
collaborative work, labor-management negotiations, interorganizational
negotiation (business, government and non-profits), international
(intercultural negotiations), coordination of autonomous agents etc. The
journal will also cover development of software for supporting group
decision and negotiation.
