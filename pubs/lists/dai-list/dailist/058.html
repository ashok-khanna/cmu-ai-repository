                        Call for Participation

  11th International Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence

                            The Homestead
               Glen Arbor, Michigan (near Traverse City)

                         February 26-28, 1992

Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is concerned with how a
decentralized group of intelligent computational agents should
coordinate their activities to achieve their goals.  When pursuing
common or overlapping goals, they should act cooperatively so as to
accomplish more as a group than individually; when pursuing conflicting
goals, they should compete intelligently.  The 11th Workshop on
Distributed Artificial Intelligence will bring together researchers
studying coordination from diverse perspectives, ranging from
distributed computing systems to discourse analysis, from formalisms for
representing nested beliefs in agents to cognitive studies of human
performance in organizations, from solving inherently distributed
problems in applications such as communication network managment to
analyzing the evolution of cooperation in populations of artificial
systems.  The objective is to identify and develop common theories and
approaches to coordination in order to improve our conceptual
understandings and practical implementations of coordination processes.

Participation at the Workshop will be by invitation only and will be
limited to approximately 40 people.  To participate, please submit a
technical paper describing original research or significant applications
in DAI to the Workshop chairman.  Preference will be given to work that
addresses one or more of the four DAI themes listed below.  We
specifically discourage the submission of papers in areas such as
fine-grained parallelism, hardware or language-level concurrency, and
connectionism, because we feel that work in these areas is more
appropriate for other workshops.  A small number of "interested
observers" may also be invited to attend.  If you would like to be
considered for attendance on this basis, please submit a written request
justifying your participation.

To encourage participants to relate their work to ongoing themes in DAI
beforehand, papers are solicited for (but not strictly limited to) the
following themes:

1.  Coordination/Collaboration Knowledge: The identification, encoding,
and use of generic knowledge for coordination and collaboration.  This
theme focusses on general knowledge about resolving conflicts,
compromising, and cooperating.

2.  Coordination as Search: When viewing coordination as a search
process, decisions are needed regarding algorithms for conducting the
search, heuristics for controlling the search, and protocols for
exchanging and updating portions of the search space.  This theme
broadly includes approaches such as distributed constraint satisfaction
search, search for compatible distributed plans, search in cooperative
problem-solving and design, negotiation search, and search for
appropriate organizational designs.

3.  Intelligent Agents in Enterprises and Applications: Embedding DAI
systems in computer networks used by people to solve problems allows the
automation of both cooperative problem-solving activities (such as
distributed interpretation or diagnosis) and coordination activities
(such as information filtration or resource allocation).  This theme
includes issues in identifying suitable applications of DAI technology
and in developing DAI agents that interact effectively with people and
each other.

4.  Modeling Through Communication and Observation in Adversarial and
Cooperative Systems: Building and maintaining models of other agents'
beliefs, abilities, goals, and plans is crucial for intelligent
interaction.  Topics in this theme include acquiring modeling
information (through communication and plan recognition) and using
models to make decisions about communication (deciding whether to tell
the truth, eliciting more information) and about other actions.

These themes are not mutually exclusive, and we welcome papers that
integrate insights from more than one of them.

As DAI matures, it is appearing more and more in real-world
applications.  This welcome development raises the need for engineering
principles that will help match particular techniques with kinds of
problems.  We welcome both theoretical and applied papers, and encourage
each to contribute to the development of these principles.
Specifically, theoretical papers should explain how their principles and
methods can be mapped to applications, while applied papers should
explain why they use the techniques that they do and why other
approaches are less appropriate for the problem at hand.

The Workshop will have several types of sessions, including presentation
sessions for discussion of distinguished papers, panel discussions for
papers sharing common themes, and working sessions on topics such as
unifying concepts behind coordination, and methodologies and evaluation
criteria for DAI research.

VENUE:

DAI'92 will be held at the Homestead in Glen Arbor, Michigan, 27 miles
from the Traverse City airport, on the shore of Lake Michigan and
adjacent to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  Sculpted by
glaciers and hundreds of feet in height, the dunes border the western
edge of the peninsula the Chippewa called "Leelanau," "the land of
delight."  The environment is richly forested and surrounded with relics
of frontier America, and the resort has on-site ice skating, down-hill
skiing, and cross-country trailheads to 36 kilometers of trails through
the National Lakeshore (with equipment rental and instruction
available). We'll continue the DAI tradition of a participatory workshop
by active practitioners in a setting that offers seclusion, natural
beauty, and recreational intermissions.

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Papers for review should be a maximum length of 10 pages, in a legible
format.  Please submit 4 copies to Edmund H. Durfee (address below), and
indicate on the title page the theme(s) for which the paper is most
relevant.  Also, please include an electronic mail address for the
appropriate contact person along with the submission.

DATES:

Deadline for paper submissions (4 copies, 10 page max): November 1, 1991.

Notification of acceptance:                             December 16, 1991.

Final papers due (for distribution at the Workshop):    January 17, 1992.

We expect that revised versions of the best papers from the Workshop
will be considered for inclusion in an appropriate journal or in a
published collection.

Subject: Knowledge Sharing

Several people have asked me for more information on the DARPA sponsored
Knowledge Sharing Effort I talked about recently.  Here is a brief
overview.  Tim

                    THE KNOWLEDGE SHARING EFFORT

The Knowledge Sharing Effort is a consortium to develop conventions
facilitating sharing and reuse of knowledge bases and knowledge based
systems.  The goal of the effort is to define, develop, and test
infrastructure and supporting technology to enable participants to build
much bigger and more broadly functional systems than could be achieved
working alone.  The output of the effort consists of (1) public-domain
specifications and implementations of supporting technology; (2)
reports, papers, and technical articles; (3) a reusable public library
of proof-of-concept demonstrations.

Building new knowledge-based systems today usually entails constructing
new knowledge bases from scratch.  It could instead be done by
assembling together reusable components.  System developers would then
only need to worry about creating the specialized knowledge and
reasoners new to the specific task of their system.  Their new system
would interoperate with existing systems, using them to perform some of
its reasoning.  In this way, declarative knowledge, problem solving
techniques, and reasoning services could all be shared among systems.
This would facilitate building bigger and better systems cheaply.  The
infrastructure to support such sharing and reuse would lead to greater
ubiquity of these systems, potentially transforming the knowledge
industry.  Definition of conventions enabling sharing among
collaborators is the essential first step toward these goals.

Technical analyses of knowledge representation technology indicated four
complementary areas in which development of common, agreed-upon
conventions would enhance leverage between individual research efforts.
(These analyses were initiated in a three-day workshop involving over 40
top AI and database researchers from DARPA, NSF, and industry
communities.)  The Knowledge Sharing Effort is organized around working
groups addressing each of these four areas.  They are:

  INTERLINGUA: concerned with translation between different
  representation languages, with sub-interests in translation at design
  time and at run-time

  KRSS (Knowledge Representation System Specification): concerned with
  defining common constructs within families of representation languages

  EXTERNAL INTERFACES: concerned with run-time interactions between
  knowledge based systems and other modules in a run-time environment,
  with sub-interests in communication protocols for KB-to-KB and for
  KB-to-DB

  SHARED, REUSABLE KNOWLEDGE BASES: concerned with facilitating
  consensus on contents of sharable knowledge bases, with sub-interests
  in shared knowledge for particular topic areas and in
  topic-independent development tools/methodologies.

As of the end of summer, 1991, the effort had completed the first year
of its program.  In that first year, an overall model was formulated for
the architecture of large knowledge-based systems and the envisioned
development methodology for producing such systems.  The four working
groups were established and began work on their respective tasks.  The
groups working on translation, common languages, and communication
protocols have each produced draft specifications; these are being
circulated within the groups for refinement and will be disseminated to
the rest of the AI community over the coming year.  The group on
ontology libraries has been concentrating on experiments to foster a
better understanding of requirements; one such experiment has been
conducted in the first year, three additional experiments are planned
for the second.

More specifically, the Knowledge Sharing Effort has in the first year:

  - Defined a very general and very flexible model for the architecture
    of large, knowledge-based systems that allows for a development
    paradigm of composing these systems out of smaller, reusable modules
    assembled either at design-time or at run-time.  

  - Documented the model in an article to appear in the fall issue of
    AI Magazine.

  - Developed a draft specification for a knowledge interchange format,
    a mechanism for avoiding the cost of building translators between
    arbitrary languages by providing an intermediate language suitable
    for bi-directional translation between it and the others.

  - Developed a small testbed knowledge base and used it to demonstrate
    the viability of translation into the knowledge interchange format
    from three different representation languages.

Global goals for the upcoming year are to:

  - Publish specifications for the knowledge interchange format
    and for a common frame-based, object-oriented terminological
    representation language.

  - Disseminate a document on application interface and intermodule
    communication protocols.

  - Establish a set of test suites in an on-line generic knowledge
    base library.

  - Perform several experiments on collaborative, multisite 
    knowledge-based system construction utilizing the knowledge
    sharing conventions developed in this effort.

  - Publish reports from all working groups.

The Knowledge Sharing Effort currently involves participants from over a
dozen different research centers around the United States, as well as a
small number of centers abroad.  A representative list of participating
research centers includes AT&T, Carnegie-Mellon University, EITech,
Hewlett-Packard Research Center, Lockheed, Northwestern University,
University of Saarbrucken, USC / Information Sciences Institute,
Stanford Research Institute, Stanford University, Unisys Center for
Advanced Information Technology, University of Maryland, University of
Texas, and Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
