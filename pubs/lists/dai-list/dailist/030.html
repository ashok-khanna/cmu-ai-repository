(1) Distributed Planning and Problem Solving Systems (DPPSS)

DPPSS handle tasks that cannot be dealt with effectively and
efficiently by one single processor. Such tasks are characterized by
geographically distributed input/output operations, a large degree of
functional specialization, time-stressed demands for solution, and a
need for reliable computation and graceful degradation in case of
partial failure of components. The theoretical issues studied in this
project relate in general to problem decomposition, subproblem
distribution, subproblem solution and synthesis of the total solution.
Four domains of applications are described below as separate project
developments.

Participants: Ron Lo, Qing Ge, Ji Gao, John Stapp, Curt Chapman, Uttam
Sengupta, Cem H. Bozsahin, Raphael Malyankar, Parag Parekh, Francis
Annareddy, and Nicholas V. Findler.

(2) Studies on Distributed Air Traffic Control

A Location-Centered, Cooperative Planning System, based on a network of
loosely-coupled nodes (airborne processors), was developed. Nodes belong
to decentralized, dynamically formed (possibly overlapping) subgroups.
The knowledge base is distributed, and the control structure among the
subgroups is hierarchically organized and is based on
Nominator-Coordinator-Coworker relations. A node may, at the same time,
assume several roles as a Nominator, Coordinator and/or Coworker at
different levels.  Connection between Coordinators and Coworkers are
made through mutual selection and with minimum communication. The
planning paradigm adopted is simulation-based Incremental Shallow
Planning, a multipath and multistage search process. The information
structure which supports planning, 'Distributed Scratch Pads', enables a
self-healing process in case of partial failure of processors and
communication channels.  A series of experiments have been carried out
in a general-purpose DAI testbed to measure the respective levels of
control performance in three organizational structures: Local
Centralized Architecture, and Location-Centered Cooperative Planning
System with one- and two- level Coordinator-Coworker Hierarchy.

Participants: Ron Lo and Nicholas V. Findler.

(3) Distributed Hierarchical Control of Nationwide Manufacturing
Operations

The general paradigm comprises a group of dissimilar plants distributed
geographically. Each plant is connected to a transportation and a
computer network of limited capacity and varying reliability. The
constituent plants possess both spatial specialization (in terms of
their geographical location and connectedness) and functional
specialization (in terms of equipment, capabilities, skills and cost
functions). The environment is dynamic -- new orders come in, the
operational availability and the cost functions of manufacturing,
transportation and computational resources change unexpectedly. There
are two possible criteria of operation. The combine of all plants has
to produce a given number of final products either (1) at minimum
overall cost within a given period of time, or (2) at a given cost
figure within a minimum period of time. Either of these criteria
requires an optimum allocation schedule of the processing/assembly
operations to individual plants over space and time, while satisfying a
set of given and estimated constraints. The flow of control and
information between the decentralized, loosely-coupled collection of
problem solvers is defined by the manufacturing process of given
products. The negotiation process enables a node to reveal as much as
necessary of its status information to selected others. Network
perception keeps a node's model of the network uptodate on the basis of
messages sent and received.

Participants: Qing Ge, Ji Gao, Glen Reece, and Nicholas V. Findler.

(4) Distributed Control of Street Traffic Signals

This project is about the control of traffic signals by a network of
distributed processors situated at street intersections. Every processor
runs an identical expert system (with a somewhat different knowledge
base) and communicates directly with the four adjacent processors.
Messages can reach also indefinitely distant processors, modulated by
the needs of intervening ones. The information transmitted can be raw
data, processed information or expert advice. The rule-base of the
expert systems has a natural segmentation, corresponding to different
prevailing traffic patterns and the respective control strategies.
Multidimensional learning programs optimize both the hierarchy of the
rules and the parameters embedded in individual rules.  Different
measures of effectiveness can be selected as the criterion for
optimization. Traffic scenarios are automatically generated for a
'characteristic period' -- for a certain part of the day (e.g., morning
rush hours), a certain type of day in the week (e.g., regular work day),
a certain season of the year (e.g., vacation time). The results of our
first implementation, a running prototype simulation program, has proven
the feasibility and utility of the approach.

Participants: John Stapp, Curt Chapman, and Nicholas V. Findler.

(5) Distributed Control of Time-Stressed Allocation of Moving Resources
to Moving Tasks

There is a hierarchy of decision making entities, each with an area of
jurisdiction and a set of moving resources of different types. There
are scheduled and unscheduled tasks of different priorities and types
that need to be serviced by an appropriate resource-mix. The problem is
how to allocate the resources over space and time for optimum task
accomplishment while a set of constraints are satisfied.  Four
fundamental issues are being studied within this paradigm:
(a) What are the relative measures of effectiveness of strict
hierarchical versus flexible lattice-like structures for Command,
Control and Communication activities.
(b) The constant ownership of resources by the entities is replaced by
the idea of dynamic scoping when, as a result of lateral
communications, resources are loaned/returned to/from the nearest
qualified node within the current 'scope', in response to declared
needs.
(c) "Soft" real-time planning is performed in non-deterministic
environments when some plan components have strong precedence
requirements whereas others do not, and some actions have to be
completed before a given time point whereas others have more relaxed
time constraints. Accordingly, a priority number is associated with
each action being planned, which number is the product of constant
factors (e.g., the action's absolute and relative importance vis-a-vis
others) and varying factors (e.g., the action's current time
criticality). The priority numbers control the ordering of the
objectives of the planning process.
(d) A hierarchical planning mechanism first creates skeleton plans
which are then refined into instances of action sequences and
resource-mixes by a rule-based system using a time-critical inference
mechanism. The rules are arranged in a hierarchy of priorities so that
more and more details are taken into account with each iteration of the
inference mechanism. This ordering also guarantees that the result of
the planning process is always as good as possible to obtain within the
time available. The planner is supplemented with a simulation model for
plan verification and monitoring.

Participants: Uttam Sengupta, Cem H. Bozsahin, Raphael Malyankar, 
Parag Parekh, Francis Annareddy, and Nicholas V. Findler.

(6) Intelligent Distributed Simulation Models

The fusion of simulation modeling and knowledge-based decision-support
techniques is important as the combined system can gain from the power
and specialization of the components. Simulation is ideal for modelling
and understanding complex phenomena while knowledge-based systems
provide the cognitive support -- a property that simulation models
lack. However, the marriage of these two diverse techniques introduces
problems of communication and the need of a unified representation
scheme. Performance also suffers as both these techniques are
computationally expensive. Our Plan Generator for Multiple Unit Law
Enforcement Simulation is a knowledge-based planning system driven by a
sophisticated simulation model. It is designed to measure the
performance of Coast Guard resources under dynamically changing
conditions. It serves as a tool for planning resource schedules and
patrol routes, and for enhancing and measuring resource utilization.
Results from these studies can also be used in phasing out less
reliable/useful resources and acquiring new ones. We are studying ways
in which the total computational task can be divided into
geographically and/or functionally distinct subtasks, which are then
performed on several connected workstations.

Francis Annareddy, and Nicholas V. Findler.

	EUROPEAN SUMMER SCHOOL on MACHINE LEARNING
	ES2ML-91

	July 22nd till 31th 1991
	Priory Corsendonk,
	Oud-Turnhout, Belgium

The European Summer School on Machine Learning (ES2ML) is a non-profit
event organized by the European Machine Learning community. Its goal is
to educate on the state of the art in Machine Learning, the subfield of
Artificial Intelligence which is concerned with computational theories
of systems that learn. The school approaches Machine Learning both as a
research discipline and as a tool for developing real-world
applications.

ES2ML emphasizes the acquisition of research and development skills in
the area of Machine Learning. In addition, it serves as a forum for
exchanging views on current practice, needs and opportunities in the
research and industrial community. The objective is to learn not only
about Machine Learning but also about the broader context in which this
research is to be oriented, organized, validated and ultimately turned
into practice.

ES2ML-91 is patronized by the European Coordinating Committee for
Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI), the Belgian Association for Artificial
Intelligence (BAAI), the Commission of the European Communities (CEC),
the Belgian National Science Foundation (NFWO/FNRS) and the Institute
for Scientific Research in Industry and Agriculture (IWONL/IRSIA).
Additional sponsoring has been obtained from ALCATEL and KNOWLEDGE
TECHNOLOGIES

ES2ML-91 is organized by Walter Van de Velde (B) and Carl-Gustav Jansson
(S). All mail concerning the summer school should be sent to Walter Van
de Velde at the address mentioned at the end of this message or by email
to es2ml@arti.vub.ac.be.

PROGRAMME

The objectives of the third ES2ML are realized through an intensive
9-day course with hands-on practice, case- studies and plenty of time
for discussions and informal interactions. The participants have free
choice out of more than 60 hours of intensive classes, presentations,
practice, demonstrations and discussions. The various activities will
be flexibly organized and tuned to meet the audience's preferences and
interests.

The main courses will be focussed on, but not limited to, the following
areas of Machine Learning:

	Empirical and Analytical Learning Techniques
	Incremental and Integrated Learning
	Case-based and Memory-based Reasoning
	Genetic Algorithms
	Computational Learning Theory

Attendants wishing to deepen their understanding of state-of-the-art
techniques will acquire hands-on practice. Teaching assistants provide
guidance in small- scale implementation and application courses. In
addition a variety of demonstration systems will be present on-site.

Realistic case-studies are selected to emphasize emerging guidelines and
methodologies for the application of state-of-the-art techniques to
real-world tasks. Special sessions will be devoted to the following task
areas:

	Knowledge Acquisition
	Inductive Logic Programming
	Robotics and Autonomous Systems
	Diagnosis and Design Applications

Participants are invited to present their own applications and problems
through posters and short presentations to be organized during the
school. They are also encouraged to dynamically form panels and
discussion groups. Material as well as space will be plenty.

Finally a topical day on technology transfer will focus on the
problems, opportunities and the interplay between activities in
research and industrial communities active in the area of Machine
Learning.

INTENDED AUDIENCE

ES2ML will be interesting for researchers, developers and managers. The
attendees will learn, not only about specific techniques but also about
the opportunities and problems of applying these to, for example,
knowledge acquisition, robotics or design problems. ES2ML is useful
for managers that are considering to start their own applications of
machine learning. Courses provide in-depth studies of applications. The
school offers ample opportunity for informal discussion with the best
people in Machine Learning. Finally ES2ML wants to attract anyone who
is interested in the transfer process of advanced information
technology from theory to practice.

VENUE

ES2ML will take place near Turnhout (Belgium) in the Priory Corsendonk.
