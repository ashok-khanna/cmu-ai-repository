MA Authorship?
-------------

I've just read Long Qiegang's comment in DAI-52.  I think one of the
problems we might be seeing here is that, as computer scientists etc.,
we like to cleanly catagorise systems into some sort of classification
hierarchy. It looks like that "might" be possible if we take a holistic
view of DAI, ignoring the spectrum MA <----> DPS.  Realistically, I
think, it appears that we might view the spectrum MA <----> DPS as being
made up of points, where each point corresponds to a classification
hierarchy.  If memory serves me, I think I saw something in AI-Magazine
that attempted to do just this (circa 1985?).  Now might be a good time
to update that report.

What I think is important, and refreshing, is that this newsgroup has 
succeeded where others have failed (signal/noise > 1). (some of) The main 
players in this new field of research have carried out a worthwhile 
dialogue in front of us all.  In my view they have allowed me to
distinguish  between MA and DPS. 

What would I like to see? I think it would be nice if someone said (in
this newsgroup) "Okay, I will take the dialogue we have just had and
produce a paper." That way the dialogue is made available to others,
and we have an accepted terminology for future use.  In its own right, I
suppose, the creation of such a paper would be evidence of DAI.  That
is, the paper could be viewed from 2 perspectives.  First, a record of
the dialogue with its conclusion.  Secondly, as an example of an
existing distributed MA system within the scientific community (us, the
way we work together).
