                               MAAMAW 93
                      Fifth European Workshop on
            Modelling Autonomous Agents in a Multi-Agent World
                           August, 24-28 1993
                         Neuchatel, Switzerland

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Purpose:
The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multiagent systems. MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies. While classical DAI research was mainly concerned
with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view of a common
goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several autonomous
agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and abilities, share a
common environment and pursue either shared or competing goals. MAAMAW
is therefore interested both in classical DAI problems (coordination,
communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.) and in theories of
intention and action, or, more generally, in the autonomous agent and
multi-agent system architectures. Multiagent models are a new area of
research in rapid growth, of relevant interest both for AI and for
social and management sciences. Both novel theoretical and computational
approaches to multiagent topics are encouraged. The submitted papers
will undergo a strict selection. It is an international workshop to
discuss your ideas or exhibit your systems.

Multiagent Olympics:
There will be a competition and a prize for the most interesting
multiagent system (software, hardware). People willing to present a
system must contact in advance the local organizers (see the
registration form).

Subject: CFP 2nd Feature Interaction Workshop
Date: Mon, 12 Jul 1993 15:30:00 +0200 (MET DST)

			  CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
	  Second International Workshop on Feature Interactions
		  in Telecommunications Software Systems
			Amsterdam, The Netherlands
			      May 9-10, 1994

			       DESCRIPTION

This workshop is the second in a series, whose mission is to encourage
researchers from a variety of computer science specialties (software
engineering, protocol engineering, distributed artificial intelligence,
formal techniques, software testing, and distributed systems, among
others) to apply their techniques to the feature interaction problem
that arises in building telecommunications software systems (see the
back page for a description of the problem).  We welcome papers on
avoiding, detecting, and/or resolving feature interactions using either
analytical or structural approaches.  Submissions are encouraged in (but
are not limited to) the following topic areas:
  - Classification of feature interactions.
  - Modeling, reasoning, and testing techniques for detecting feature
interactions. 
  - Software platforms and architecture designs  to aid in avoiding,
    detecting, and resolving feature interactions.
  - Tools and methodologies for promoting software compatibility and 
    extensibility.
  - Mechanisms for managing feature interactions throughout the
    service life-cyle.
  - Management of feature interactions in PCS, ISDN, and Broadband
    services, as well as IN services.  
  - Management of feature interactions in various of the operations
    support functions such as Service Negotiation, Service Management,
    and Service Assurance.
  - Feature Interactions and their potential impact on system Security 
    and Safety. 
  - Environments and automated tools for related problems in other
    software systems. 
  - Management of Feature Interactions in various proposed
    architectures such as TMN, INA, ROSA, CASSIOPEIA, SERENITE, or
    PLATINA.

			  FORMAT

We hope to promote a dialogue among researchers in various related
areas, as well as the designers and builders of telecommunications
software.  To this end, the workshop will have sessions for paper
presentations, including relatively long discussion periods.  Panel
discussions and tool demonstrations are also planned.

			ATTENDANCE

Workshop attendance will be limited to 90 people. Attendance will be by
invitation only. Prospective attendees are asked to submit either a
paper (maximum 5000 words) or a single page description of their
interests and how they relate to the workshop. About 16-20 of the
attendees will be asked to present talks. We will strive for an equal
mix of theoretical results and practical experiences. Papers will be
published in a conference proceedings.

			    WORKSHOP STATEMENT

The feature interaction problem has been a major obstacle to the rapid
deployment of new telephone services.  Telecommunications software is
huge, real-time, and distributed; adding new features to a
telecommunication system, like adding new functionalities to any large
software system, can be very difficult.  Each new feature may interact
with many existing features, causing customer annoyance or total system
breakdown.  Traditionally, interactions were detected and resolved on a
feature by feature basis by experts who are knowledgeable on all
existing features.  As the number of features grows to satisfy diverse
needs of customers, managing feature interactions in a single
administrative domain is approaching incomprehensible complexity.  In a
future marketplace where features deployed in the network may be
developed by different operating companies and their associated vendors,
the traditional approach is no longer feasible.  How to detect, resolve,
or even prevent the occurrence of feature interactions in an open
network becomes an important research issue.

The feature interaction problem is not unique to telecommunications
software; similar problems are encountered in any long-lived software
system that requires frequent changes and additions to its
functionality.  Techniques in many related areas appear to be applicable
to the management of feature interactions.  Software methodologies for
extensibility and compatibility, for example, could be useful for
providing a structured design that can prevent many feature interactions
from occurring.  Formal specification, verification, and testing
techniques, being widely used in protocol engineering and software
engineering, contribute a lot to the detection of interactions.  Several
causes of the problem, such as aliasing, timing, and the distribution of
software components, are similar to issues in distributed systems.
Cooperative problem solving, a promising approach for resolving
interactions at run time, resembles distributed planning and resolution
of conflicting subgoals among multiple agents in the area of distributed
artificial intelligence. This workshop aims to provide an opportunity
for participants to share ideas and experiences in their respective
fields, and to apply their expertise to the feature interaction problem.
