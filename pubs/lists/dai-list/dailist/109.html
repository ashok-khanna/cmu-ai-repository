Subject: Negotiation & Conflict Resolution

We are aware of the work done by Drs. Sycara, Klein, Lander, Werkman and
Kannapan in the area of Conflict Resolution and Negotiation. We are very
interested in finding out about any other relevant work in this area and
key papers that have been published.

We are particulary interested in hearing about any implementations of
the conflict resolution and negotiation mechanisms, in what context they
have been implemented (e.g., Concurrent Engineering), how they were
evaluated, and how they performed.

If you have any information please send us some email, or send us your
best papers!

Many thanks for your help in advance.  Please forgive me if I've already
asked you about this issue.

                          CALL FOR PAPERS
                  Second International Conference on
       Information Systems and Management of Data - CISMOD 93

Date:    October 6-8, 1993
Venue:   New Delhi, India

AIMS OF THE CONFERENCE

The CISMOD series of conferences aim to provide an international forum
to exchange ideas and experiences on the research, development and
applications of data management methodologies, tools, techniques and
systems. Covering a wide range of issues and topics, these conferences
place special emphasis on original work connected with evolving
techniques in databases and their applications. State-of-art reviews and
new perspectives are also encouraged.  The CISMOD conferences are
therefore targeted to serve researchers, developers, managers, users and
others interested in the state-of-art activities in Information Systems
and Data Management. CISMOD'93 continues this tradition.

Hi,
 I'm starting a work on distributed artificial intelligence and I would
like to know about formal theory of DAI.  I mean mostly formal method
which I could use to describe a society of intelligent agents;
something similar to prof. Zeigler's endomorphic agents.  Please, let
me know anything you think I should know about endomorphic systems and
distributed artificial intelligence.

Thanks for your time and knowledge,
