You may wish to note the following book on DAI:

COORDINATING PLANS of AUTONOMOUS AGENTS

by

Frank von Martial
DETECON GmbH
Germany

appeared as "Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence", No. 610
Springer Verlag, June 1992
ISBN 3-540-55615-x
250 pages

A novel approach to coordinate activities of autonomous agents is
presented. The coordination of plans is triggered by the relations which
exist between the actions of different plans.
The main contributions of this book include:
1. a detailed taxonomy of relations between the plans of different
agents,
2. strategies for coordination and plan modifications based on these
relations, and
3. a negotiation framework for synchronizing activities.

The reader may also appreciate the thorough introduction to the field of
distributed AI and its subarea, multiagent planning (ca. 50 pages).

CONTENTS:
   Foreword (by Victor R. Lesser)

2. Cooperation and Coordination of Intelligent Agents
3. Actions and Plans in Multiagent Domains

Subject: Theoretical DAI???

This is an attempt to start a debate on the nature and role of theory
within DAI. I would like to see if we can come to any kind of consensus
on the following:

1) Is theory useful within DAI?
2) What kinds of things do we expect our theories to talk about?
3) Does DAI really have a common theoretical core?
4) What methodology should we adopt to improve our theories?

My own view is that at present theory is of limited use in DAI, mainly
because it is not sufficiently developed.  The type of use I see being
made of such theories is as a repository for our understanding of the
common core of matters of interest to the DAI community.  I believe that
such a common core will be found in a fairly coarse-grained model of
agenthood and interaction, but one where agents have some relevant
internal structure.  The last question is one I cannot easily answer.

I accept that this seems a very waffly start - but as far as I know it
is this type of general discussion for which this group was created.  I
would appreciate responses from anyone who disagrees with any of the
statements I have made, or wants to expand upon any of the points.

It has been pointed out to me in an e-mail reply that there are of
course many disciplines such as economics, sociology and distributed
systems which share (or appear to share) some of the same concerns with
DAI.  My point here is that the *types* of theories developed in these
disciplines are completely different.  Sociology tends to rely on
theories expressed in natural language; economics on real variables;
distributed systems on process calculi.  Which type of theory should we
be going for in DAI and why?  Which of these theories generates the most
insights?  Which is of most practical value?
