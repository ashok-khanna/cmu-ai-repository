Hi,

I have set up an FTP site for DAI information.  It will initially
support
* paper and technical report abstracts
* bibliographies
* back issues of DAI-List.

To contribute abstracts or bibliographies, please send them to me as
ASCII text and I will include them.  I will make provisions soon for
ASCII or Postscript versions of complete papers.

Directions for accessing the DAI Archives:

% ftp ftp.einet.net (or to 192.147.157.225)
Name: anonymous
Send e-mail address as password (for example: huhns@mcc.com).
Password: 

ftp> cd dai
ftp> ls
abstracts
bib
dailist
README.TXT
ftp> cd dailist
ftp> get 121.23may93

Back issues of DAI-List are stored as Number.Date (e.g., 121.23may93).
The abstracts subdirectory is currently empty, and the bib subdirectory
contains one large bibliography that I got from Ed Durfee in 1989.
The README.TXT file contains the information in this message.

Contact me for help in using this, or if you have any suggestions for
improvements.  I hope you find this useful.

Mike

COOPERATING HETEROGENEOUS SYSTEMS: A BLACKBOARD-BASED META APPROACH

It is increasingly the case that organizations rely upon diverse
computer systems to perform a variety of knowledge-based tasks.  This
not only presents technical issues of interoperability and integration,
but philosophical issues of how cooperation and interaction between
computational entities is to be realized.  Cooperating systems are
systems that work together toward a common end.  To develop cooperating
heterogeneous systems the technical and philosophical must find common
ground.  The concepts of cooperation must find realization in
technically sound system architectures.

The heterogeneity and complexity of knowledge sources make it difficult
to design and use an integrated system.  This is particularly true of
systems that are constructed of preexisting components, each of which
has its own task, design, and structure.  We advocate adding a uniform
metalayer between knowledge sources and the rest of the system.  The
layer consists of a family of interpreters, one for each knowledge
source, and metaknowledge.  A system architecture to integrate and
control diverse knowledge sources is presented.  The architecture is
based on the metalevel properties of the logic programming language
Prolog.  We describe an implementation of the architecture, a Framework
for Logic Programming Systems with Distributed Execution (FLiPSiDE).

Based on the vanilla blackboard interpreter, we present interpreter
enhancements that model the cooperative behavior of knowledge sources.
Examples of interpreters to handle shared semantics and multiple
interaction behaviors are shown.  We introduce a dedicated trigger
handler knowledge source to the design of control blackboard
architectures.  The advantages of such a knowledge source, including
dynamic modification of triggers, are described.  The support of human
users is presented as an example of integrating heterogeneous users with
the computational knowledge sources.  The FLiPSiDE architecture is
generalized to create a distributed Prolog environment.

As background we present the blackboard model and some of its
realizations, explain the concepts of metalevel systems, and examine
organizational learning and decision making to determine the essential
characteristics of cooperation.

Date: Wed, 26 May 1993 14:08-0400

Folks,

I would like to express my appreciation, and I am sure the appreciation
of the entire DAI community, to Katia Sycara and Michael Huhns for the
work that they have done on our behalf.  Katia organized an excellent
12th International Workshop on DAI.  Michael helped to develop the
consensus on how to proceed with the next DAI workshop and our first
international joint conference.  We are blessed to have colleagues in
our area of research as able as Katia and Michael.

Sincerely,
Carl Hewitt
