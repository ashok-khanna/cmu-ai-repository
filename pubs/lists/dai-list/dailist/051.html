Subject: DPS vs MAS

We (Keele) wish to express our appreciation to all those who have
contributed to the debate on DPS vs. MAS, originally initiated by Farhad
Haidari of Keele.  Having seen the contributions so far, we have formed
the following opinion.  Comments on this will be welcome.

Pure DPS and Pure MAS seem to lie at the two extremes of the same
spectrum.  A pure DPS is a special purpose system, built typically from
scratch, to solve a specific problem.  The problem is divided into
tasks, and special task performers (agents) are designed to solve these
tasks for that problem only.  All interaction (cooperation, coordination
if any) strategies are incorporated as an integral part in the design of
the system.  It is a kind of top-down designed system, since agents are
designed to conform to the requirements specified at the top.

DPS may also be described as a closed system, in the sense that the
interfaces of its agents are closed, i.e., the agents are not intended
to participate in other DPSs except the one for which they are designed.

In contrast in a pure multiagent system, the agents are autonomous,
potentially preexising, and typically heterogeneous.  Although an agent
here can also be a special task performer, it has an open (in the sense
of standard) interface, which is accessible to everyone (using the right
standard).  It can therefore participate in any multiagent systems
wherever its skill is called for, the open interface facilitating the
necessary interagent interactions.  An agent may act differently in
different situations, cooperating, competing or whatever, depending on
the requirements.  So an MAS can act as a DPS when required, but it can
also act differently when required.

An MAS can also be viewed as a bottom-up designed system, since in
principle agents are designed first (they can preexist), and the
solution strategy (top) for a given problem is specified later.

Most systems, however, are likely to lie away from the two extreme
points of the spectrum.

Subject: More on DPS vs. MA Systems

Based on the discussion so far it seems that DPS/MA systems can be
viewed from at least three valid perspectives, and there are different
definitions and characterizations from each perspective.

Perspective 1:  the viewpoint of the designer(s) of the system.  Jeff
Rosenschein has presented a definition from this perspective, where he
states that "a `pure' MA system is one where the agents have been
designed separately, by different designers."

Perspective 2:  the viewpoint of an observer of the system, who is
trying to characterize it, or the problems it is solving, as either DPS
or MA.  Les Gasser and Ed Durfee have presented definitions from this
perspective, based on the competition and cooperation that occurs in the
system and whether or not there is a common problem or goal being solved
by the system, or whether the goals require collective action.

Perspective 3:  the viewpoint of an observer of an agent in the system,
who is trying to characterize how autonomously the agent can or does
behave.  My contributions to the discussion have come from this
perspective.

Interestingly, all contributors to the discussion seem to agree that the
DVMT represents a DPS system, because 1) it was constructed by one
design team, 2) it had a single overall problem it was trying to solve
and whose solution required collective activity, and 3) its problem
solvers had insufficient autonomy to do anything other than work on
vehicle tracks.
