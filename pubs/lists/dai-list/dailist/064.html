               Fourth European Workshop on
       Modeling Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Worlds

                     July, 29-31 1992
                        Rome, Italy

                 PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

The purpose of this Workshop is to stimulate exchange and discussion of
research in the field of multi-agent systems.  MAAMAW is the European
forum for DAI studies.  While classical DAI research was mainly
concerned with distributed problem solving and task allocation in view
of a common goal, MAAMAW emphasizes the problems arising when several
autonomous agents, endowed with their own goals, knowledge, and
abilities, share a common environment and pursue either shared or
competing goals.  MAAMAW is therefore interested both in classical DAI
problems (coordination, communication, cooperation, negotiation, etc.)
and in theories of intention and action, or, more generally, in the
architecture of the autonomous agent.  Multi-agent models are a new area
of rapidly growing research that is of relevant interest both for AI and
for social and management sciences.  Both novel theoretical and
computational approaches to multi-agent topics are encouraged.  The
submitted papers will undergo a strict selection.  A 60 people
international workshop to discuss your ideas or exhibit your system.

Topics of MAAMAW interest include, but are not limited to:
          * Agents architectures (high level, reactive, situated agents)
          * Artificial life from a multi-agent perspective
          * Cooperation, coordination, and conflict
          * Communication (protocols, linguistic strategies, negotiation
            approaches)
          * Distributed multi-agent planning and group work
          * Distributed algorithms for multi-agent interactions
          * Learning of cooperation and coordination
          * Hardware based on multi-agent perspective
          * Multi-agent testbeds for simulating multi-agent interactions
          * Formal specification and verification of agents and systems
            of agents
          * Conceptual and theoretical foundations of multi-agent
            systems.

This year the workshop will focus on:

          *** SOCIAL SIMULATION ***

with special reference to:
          * Social organization, social roles, norms
          * Power and influence between agents
          * Collective agents, joint intentions, commitment, and
            responsibility in social action
          * DAI and the Multi-Agent perspective for the social sciences

Preprints of the proceedings will be available at the workshop.  Papers
from the proceedings will be revised and appear in a book of the
''Decentralized AI'' series published by Elsevier/North Holland.

I call your attention to "Cooperative Solution of Constraint
Satisfaction Problems", pages 1181-1183 of volume 254 of Science (22
November 1991), by Clearwater, Huberman, and Hogg, of the Xero PARC.

I have great enthusiasm that imminent breakthroughs will make
"cooperation" as exciting a topic as chaos, catastrophe, fractals,
high-temperature superconductivity, ... (there also will be the usual
charlatanry--a subject for another time).  This article is an accessible
introduction to one small aspect of this area.

There is little scientific meat in "Cooperative Solution ...":  two
graphs, and two formulas constitute most of its substance.  The article
reads like a project status report to management--that's not a curse,
just a description.  What the article *does* give are references to a
couple of interesting piece in the professional literature, and these
scattered assertions:
1.  the authors and their colleagues are crystallizing their results
into "a theory that elucidates the performance of cooperative processes
searching through a large problem space ...";
2.  "cooperative searches, when sufficiently large, can display
universal characteristics, independent of the detailed nature of either
the individual process or the particular problem ...:
a.  the existence of a sharp transition from exponential to polynomial
    time ...;
b.  the appearance of a lognormal distribution in the effectiveness of
    an individual agent's problem solving";
3.  the results seem to be good for at least two different forms of
cooperation:
a.  blackboard systems (agents communicate through a central data
    store--some think of this as a star topology);
b.  genetic algorithms (communication by differential reproduction);
4.  "striking overall improvements in performance become apparent" with
cooperation.  The authors constructed demonstrations of factors of
10-100; and
5.  "This work suggest an alternative to the current mode of
constructing task-specific computer programs that deal with constraint
satisfaction problems.  Rather than spending all the effort in
developing a monolithic program or perfect heuristic, it may be better
to have a set of relatively simple cooperating processes work
concurrently on the problem while communicating their partial results."

This last suggests to me conclusions of great practical and theoretical
importance.  In this posting, I want only to advertise the published
work mentioned above.  If the topic sufficiently interests others,
perhaps I'll note down some of my own speculations.

This is interesting and quite exciting of course, but the idea is not
completely new.  See in particular

1979 "Simplification by Cooperating Decision Procedures" by Nelson and
Oppen. TOPLAS 1(2), pp 245-257

In this paper, the authors give a rigorous formal description of a
method for obtaining a single decision procedure out of the cooperative
work of different decision procedures, which communicate by broadcasting
equality constraints; thus, equality constraints act as a kind of common
"interface", trough which different decision procedures can communicate.

I found the argument of this article somewhat hard to understand.  What
does cooperation have to do with finding speedier solutions to
cryptarithmetic problems?  The "hints" that agents post are simple
heuristics that could be incorporated into a (noncooperative) search
strategy.  Any stochastic search process using such heuristics should
observe the same lognormal distribution.

Still, the article was intriguing and I appreciate not having to read
too many equations.  Unfortunately there is an error in the first one.

The article in Science had some heavy statistics, which is why I
suppose it got published.  But I didn't think the conclusion was
supported by the experiment.

They ran a single agent choosing randomly, several agents working in
partitions, and several agents sharing hints.  From the improved
performance of the last case, on a toy example, they conclude that it is
better to have simple cooperating processes than a single task-specific
program. !!!

Aside from the fact that the latter approach was not compared, it is
clear from the results that the hints, a primitive heuristic, made all
the difference in efficiency.  A more supportable conclusion is that
task-specific programs, taking advantage of such heuristics, will always
win.  (Quote from the article: "The way agents interpret their hints has
a strong effect on the rate at which they solve the problem.")
