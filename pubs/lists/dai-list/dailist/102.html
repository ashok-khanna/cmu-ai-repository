		ViewFinder: A Framework for Representing,
	       Ascribing and Maintaining Nested Beliefs of
			    Interacting Agents

				 Abstract

Interacting with agents in an intelligent manner means that the computer
program is able to adapt itself to the specific requirements of agents.
The dissertation is concerned with an important feature necessary for
this ability to adapt:  the use of models of the beliefs and knowledge
of the interacting agents.

The objective of this dissertation is to detail a theory of belief, by
which is meant a theory of how the contents of nested belief models are
formed.  The work is motivated by (i) the aspects of representation,
formation, and revision of nested belief models that have been
neglected, and (ii) the lack of a unifying framework for all of these
features of nested beliefs.

In much research involving models of the beliefs of agents, the models
used are given.  While this is sufficient in highly constrained domains,
it is inappropriate in general.  In more complex domains, it is
necessary to dynamically generate these models.  This dissertation is
directly concerned with the problems of dynamically creating such nested
models of the beliefs of agents.

Major Contributions

Using Stereotypes for Belief Ascription:  The use of stereotypes (in
particular, hierarchically organized stereotypes) is shown to be an
excellent method for making shallow belief models, i.e., the system's
view of another agent, but to suffer from serious problems as a
mechanism for making deeper ascriptions.  A precedence inheritance
reasoner for stereotypes is developed as this is necessary in shallow
use of stereotypes, in deep use, and in the fused ascription process
later developed.

Perturbation as a Basis for Belief Ascription:  The perturbation model
of belief ascription is investigated, and shown to be excellent for
generation of deep belief models.  However, it relies upon beliefs
generally being common between the ascribing agent (the ascriber) and
the agent to whom the beliefs are being ascribed (the ascribee), and so
is inadequate when this assumption does not hold.

Ascription Operators:  The perturbation method of belief ascription
relies on counter-evidence to block ascription.  In the investigation of
counter-evidence a number of families of ascription operators are
identified.  In particular, a distinction is made between radical
operators, which can form a disjunctive result, and conservative
operators which form a unique result.  Different types of each of these
operators are developed.

Weighing Evidence Sources:  The basic perturbation mechanism for belief
ascription intuitively implies a simple recursive algorithm.  This is
shown to be false.  It is demonstrated that prior stored nested beliefs
of the agents involved in a nesting (and prior stored beliefs of their
views of each other) must be considered as sources of evidence and
counter-evidence for ascription.  A method for totally ordering these
evidence sources is developed.

A Fused Approach:  The stereotype ascription and perturbation ascription
are fused together via the notion of atypical beliefs .  These are
beliefs that are only held by particular groups of agents.  A mechanism
based on lambda expressions is investigated for fusing atypicality into
the perturbation mechanism.  Evaluation of these lambda expressions in a
nested environments investigated, as to is the nature of transformations
on them that is required when they are ascribed from agent to agent.
Improvements are made over previously descriptions of these processes.

Interpreted and Ascribed Beliefs:  Interpreted beliefs are those beliefs
attributed to an agent based on inferences from the utterances (or
actions) of the agent.  Ascribed beliefs are those beliefs attributed to
an agent based on principles of commonality and minimal evidence about
the probable background of the agent.  It is claimed that belief
interpretation requires belief ascription as a prerequisite.  Further,
although it might be expected that interpreted beliefs would always be
preferred to ascribed ones, it is claimed that this is not necessarily
the case and that this largely depends on the inference rules used to
interpret the beliefs.  It follows that interpretation rules must be
classed to give some indication of the reliability of their inferences.

Maintenance of Nested Beliefs:  A number of aspects of belief revision
with respect to nested beliefs are considered.  It is claimed that it is
necessary to distinguish between simulating an agents own revision
mechanism, and making revisions of the belief model of the agent because
the model has proved to be wrong.  In addition, it is shown how either
of these changes can cause the system to want to change its own beliefs,
but in different ways.  Simulating the agents own revision process is
more likely to cause the system to make revisions of its beliefs about
the domain, or topic of conversation, while revisions on the belief
model are more likely to cause the system to make revisions of its
beliefs about the agent.  An operation known as percolation is devised
to aid in the former revision process.

A Framework for Environments:  A general framework for environments is
developed.  The framework is deliberately designed to be open-ended,
i.e., not completely defined.  A number of important types of
environment are discussed.  It is shown how environments may be used as
a mechanism for reasoning about ordering relations, and how, thus, they
provide an appropriate medium for reasoning about different ordering
relations, such as confidence relations, inheritance leaning relations,
etc.  Particular attention is paid to the representational problems
discussed in the background section.

Ascription Operators as Environment Projection:  The ascription
operators previously developed are generalised to be operators that
cause projection of one environment on another.  Environment projection
operators are studied in more detail, and a number of extra projection
operators are proposed, including Bayesian projection, Fuzzy projection,
and Logic Foundational projection.

Environment Projection as a Fundamental Operator:  It is shown that
environment projection can be seen as a fundamental operator underlying
many important processes in AI, including belief ascription, inheritance
reasoning, truth maintenance, belief revision, merging of intensional
descriptions, and metaphor generation.  An environment framework may
thus serve as a basis for investigation, development, and implementation
of all of these processes.


[A number of people have asked if I was talking about electronic or
physical copies of my dissertation in the above message.  I was
talking about physical, although on reflection electronic is better for
me as I have to pay for printing and mailing myself. So, if you are
interested in an electronic copy, then mail me your email address and
tell me if you can handle A4 or only US Letter (the A4 version is more
compact because its a 2-up file, i.e., really A5).]

Finally, if you'd like more details on my belief work (as well as
information on facets not covered in my dissertation), then you could
run out and get a copy of the book:-)
