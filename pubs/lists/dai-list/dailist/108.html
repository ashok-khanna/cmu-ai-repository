  Expose of an ESPRIT-III project 
  Tasks 5.7, 5.8, 6.2 
  - looking for partners -

We -?the DAI-lab at Technical University of Berlin?- are currently
looking for partners for an ESPRIT-III project. In the following you
will find an expose of the project we would like to conduct. We would
also be interested in joining an existing group possibly already having
formulated a related proposal.

If the proposed project sounds interesting to you or if you know of any
other project that might be of interest to us please contact us,
preferrably via e-mail or fax by March 15th.  Regarding our own
proposal we suggest a meeting of potential partners on March 22nd in
Berlin to speed up the procedure.

(Proposed) Title: 
The DAI-Toolkit: An Experimental Testbed For Development and
Evaluation Of DAI Scenarios

ESPRIT-Areas:
 Domain 5 (CIME), 
   Task 5.7 (provision of tools ... industrial plant ...
             control systems),
   Task 5.8 (interactive ... production management systems ... 
             multisite)
 Domain 6 (Basic Research),
   Task 6.2 (basic aspects of multiple computing agents)

Keywords: 
 Distributed Artificial Intelligence, Multiple and Cooperating 
 Agents, CIM environments, experimental testbed

  Current state of DAI research

Over the last several years considerable efforts were spent on
exploring the behavior of 'cooperative' problem-solving. It could be
shown that this extension of the traditional AI approach often leads to
more sophisticated systems when compared to using monolothic approaches
- even more so if the problem is inherently distributed and complex (as
is the case with e.g., CIM-type problems). Up to now, most energy was
put into realization of concrete systems rather than modeling
distributed problem-solving applicable on a wider range of domains.
This can be seen as a revelation of a similiar problem tackled by the
AI communitiy in the early 80's - namely the lack of a methodological
background for building 'intelligent' systems.  Nevertheless, several
researchers have come up with tentative concepts (e.g., Gasser,
Lesser). Based upon those concepts, experimental testbeds have been
developed, e.g., MACE (Gasser et al.), MICE (Durfee et al.), providing
formal languages for modeling agents. It is quite difficult, though, to
specify the behavior of agents (like solving problems in a domain,
communicating, cooperating, etc.) in a manner more abstract than
conventional programming languages.

  Objectives of the project

The overall goal of the project proposed here is to develop a generic
experimental testbed for modeling DAI scenarios. It will then be
possible for developers of DAI systems to specify and define the
behavior of agents, like solving problems in a domain, communicating,
cooperating, etc. with greater ease.  The approach taken here is highly
influenced by the 'knowledge-level' debate initiated by Newell in his
presidential address to the AAAI 1980. He claimed that a distinct level
of analyses for problem solving systems above the symbol or program
level does exist.  Since then the 'knowledge level', as he coined it,
has been identified as the adequate level of abstraction for knowledge
acquisition and engineering by a variety of authors (e.g., Wielinga, et
al., Chandrasekaran et al.). In the same spririt one of the aims of the
project will be to allow specifying the behaviour of agents in DAI
scenarios at the knowledge level.  A generic testbed should also
provide a library of predefined methods. In addition to methods
specifying the behaviour of agents, like problem-solving,
communicating, cooperating, etc., knowledge acquisition methods
allowing for multiple expertise and diverging agents are needed.  In
order to 'test the testbed' some applications in the CIM area shall
verify the usefulness of the approach. The CIM area was chosen because
of the experiences the DAI lab has in this domain, the possibility of
acquiring the expertise from our industrial partners, and last but not
least the high economic potential lying here.  Contributions of the
DAI-Lab Emerging from several externally funded research projects in the
area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), the DAI-lab was
founded in April 1992 by Prof. Dr. Hermann Krallmann, head of the
department of systems analysis and EDP at Technical University of
Berlin . It is one of four work groups the department currently
consists of.

  Current projects

In close cooperation with industrial partners several projects are
currently in progress. The outcome of all is likely to influence the
project proposed.  Objective of the project CoKoM (Cooperated
Knowledge-based System for Manufacturing Control) is enhancement of a
software system developed in a foregoing project (Blackboard-DEC), the
distributed knowledge-based shop-floor control center, VerFLEX-BB.  One
of the main goals of the project is the extension and completion of the
problem solving methods. Furthermore, the system will be physically
distributed using broadband communication technologies, specifically
B-ISDN.  In another project, TeleCAS, the goal is to enhance and
embellish a software system for computer-aided selling, which was
basically developed in the INTERBIT project. Methods and technologies
of DAI will be put to use in order to physically distribute the system
via B-ISDN and incorporate multimedial aspects. The reusability of the
whole system is another major aspect of the project.  Whereas the above
described projects are funded by Deutsche Telepost BERKOM and are
conducted with Bosch-Siemens-Hausger{te GMBH, Berlin (a manufacturer of
household appliances) as the industrial partner, the third project is
sponsored by Deutsche Forschungs-gemein-schaft (DFG). It deals with
knowledge-based configuration and is another off-spring of INTERBIT.

  Areas of research

General subject of all research and practical work at the DAI-lab are
cooperating knowledge-based systems. In the long run all work at the
lab aims at realizing the above mentioned experimental testbed for
development of DAI systems. Relevant basic parts of this testbed were
already designed and over the coming years more components will be
identified and realized. The specific topics of current research
include:

  * Modeling Agents - Tentative Agent Model

A task group at DAI-lab is concerned with definition of a generic model
of agents. Taken into account are findings of others in this area as
well as practical experience gained in the development of the above
mentioned prototypical shop-floor control center. As a first result a
tentative agent model has emerged. It differs from other approaches as
it separates the so-called object-knowledge, consisting of methods
required for solving a problem, from meta-knowledge reasoning about
those methods (e.g., knowledge for selecting and combining certain
methods). This separation has lead to a lot of 'working packages' -
like specification and operationalization of problem solving methods,
cooperation methods, goal detection, selection mechanisms etc. which
can be easily tackled by different working groups.

  * Knowledge Acquisition

The goal of a second group at the lab is to develop knowledge-
acquistion KA tools for DAI scenarios. At the moment a specific KA tool
for the VerFLEX-BB system is under way. Enhancing the KADS methodology
for acquring multiple expertise is another topic of that group.

  * Communications and Man-Machine-Interfaces

It is intended to realize physical distribution of DAI systems to be
developed using broadband communications services, specifically B-ISDN.
As the intended systems will be quite powerful it is necessary to
provide adequate means for `using' the system. The user-interfaces will
therefore include concepts from multimedia technology.

  * Complementary Research - Technology Assessment

To the staff at DAI-lab technology assessment (TA) regarding
realization and implementation of their systems in real-life
environments is a crucial aspect. Therefore, aspects of TA will be
taken into consideration in all work conducted at the lab. Some of the
problems to be tackled here include qualification of workers using DAI
systems and loss of responsibility (or a feeling thereof) in workers
supported by such systems.

  Contributions of Others

We think that the development of a generic testbed for DAI applications
is a project so ambitious that several independent tasks can be easily
identified.  We are looking for partner research institutions and
application partners in industry that would like to contribute to the
described goals.  Also, we are interested in existing or planned
projects covering this subject area.  Please do not hesitate to contact
us.

			  Intentions in Time
		Robert P. Goldman and R. Raymond Lang
		      Technical Report TU 93-101

ABSTRACT:

Representing and reasoning about goal-directed actions is necessary in
order for autonomous agents to act in or understand the commonsense
world.  This paper provides a formal theory of intentional action based
on Bratman's characterization of intention.  Our formalization profits
from the insights developed by Cohen and Levesque in their formalization
of Bratman's theory.  We review Cohen and Levesque's formalization and
illustrate its weaknesses.  Using Allen's temporal logic as a
foundation, we construct a formalization that, like Cohen and
Levesque's, satisfies Bratman's desiderata for an acceptable theory of
intentional action.  We introduce a characterization of success and
failure of intentional action and show that our richer theory of time
allows us to formalize more complex intentional actions, particularly
those with deadlines.  Finally, we argue that the use of a syntactic
theory of belief allows us to accommodate a more descriptive theory of
intentional action by fallible agents.  Our work has relevance to
applications like multiagent planning, speech-act processing and
narrative understanding.  We are pursuing applications of this theory to
representing the content of narratives and to constructing and
understanding description-based communication.

In the the Intelligent Network Management (INM) application domain, a

use agents located at the nodes to cooperate with each other in order

In this paper, we present a model of a multiagent routing framework with
particular attention being addressed to three parts of the model.
Firstly, the routing table retained by the agents which details several
paths to each destination. We present techniques to 1) enable the agents
to choose between multiple paths for some destination, and 2) let the
agents update their table by comparing the tuples with those held by
other agents.

Secondly, the hierarchical organisation in which the agents cooperate.
We provide a structure whereby an agent can retain information not only
concerning its simultaneous membership of two independent hierarchies,
but also about frequently used routes. Thirdly, the information exchange
strategy which governs what knowledge is sent to which agent and when.
We provide an example of such a strategy which gives the agents timely
and accurate information to base their decisions upon.

We go on to provide an analysis of our routing model from a number of
criteria. The manner in which the multiagent framework improves the
coherence of the routing mechanism is investigated. The paper is
terminated with an introduction to a multiagent resource cost model."

	abstract="
Often when there are a large number of intelligent agents which need to
cooperate with each other, via communication, an organisation emerges.
One of the most versatile organisations is that of a hierarchy. In this
paper we present a method for deciding upon the optimal hierarchy which
the agents should collaborate within. This mathematical treatment is
used for determining the best route between agents in an Intelligent
Network Management (INM) framework.

Once the parameters (ie the group size and the number of levels) for the
best tree have been found, a two phase process of instantiating the
physical hierachy with such parameters must be undertaken. The first
phase is to construct a logical hierarchy of the available agents. This
hierarchy will be the best possible within the constraints imposed by
both the optimal parameters and any organisational requirements of the
system.  The second phase is to convert the logical hierarchy into a
physical one shared by all the agents concerned.

We propose techniques to achieve the two phases mentioned above. Namely
a constrained minimal spanning tree algorithm for the logical tree
creation.  While a collection of inter agent negotiation protocols are
used to enable the agents to decide on the physical tree instance."

	abstract=" This is a review of the work done on coherence,
presented in comparison with a coherence framework elaborated from the
discussions we have had. This report is raw, but it will surely be
cooked when scorching comments are made about it.

Coherence is the study of how activities carried out by autonomous
agents can be integrated to produce a required global outcome and how
well the system performs as a whole. A framework for understanding
coherence is described in terms of the symptoms, causes and cures of
incoherent behaviour. From this framework, a checklist of coherence
criteria is given which should be considered when building future multi
agent systems. A review of work done by other researchers is given in
comparison with our framework while the Air Traffic Control application
domain is considered with regard to the framework."

Subject:  communication in multiagent systems

Hi, my name is Michel Ludwig and I am working on a DAI project in
Fribourg Switzerland.  I am especially interested in the communication
mechanisms in multiagent systems.  I am looking for anything on
point-to-point communication, broadcasting, or any other way to
communicate.

Thanks in advance
