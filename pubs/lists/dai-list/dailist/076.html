Subject: New results on collective action problems

In a recent report, we elucidated the dynamics of ongoing collective
action among intentional agents with imperfect information.  Their
decisions on whether or not to contribute to the collective good
depended not only on the past but also on their expectations as to how
their actions would affect those of others.  We showed that in attempts
at collective action the onset of overall cooperation can take place in
a sudden and unexpected way.  These outbreaks mark the end of long
transient states in which defection or cooperation persists in groups
that cannot sustain it indefinitely.

These initial results were obtained for groups with uniform beliefs and
preferences.  In human societies, however, an essential element
contributing to the likelihood of collective action is that individuals
differ from each other both in their beliefs and in their estimates of
the costs and benefits of contributing to the collective good.  Thus,
whereas one individual might decide to participate in the group effort
on the basis of a few others having joined, another might wait until
many others have already done so.

We have now investigated the effects of diversity on collective action
problems.  First of all, we found out that diversity acts as an
additional source of uncertainty, thus shortening the time to an
outbreak.  Also, we showed that when several subgroups with different
beliefs are merged into a larger group, overall cooperation (or
defection) can appear in clearly separated stages.  These results were
obtained using a combination of analytical techniques and computer
simulations.  (B. Huberman and N. Glance)

Stan Rosenschein and I are editing a special issue of the AI Journal on
"Computational Theories of Interaction and Agency."  We started from the
observation that a wide variety of people in AI and cognitive science
are using principled characterizations of interactions between agents
and their environments to guide their theorizing and designing and
modeling.  I can send further details to anyone who's curious.

                            CALL FOR PAPERS
           Artificial Intelligence: An International Journal
   Special Issue on Computational Theories of Interaction and Agency 

Edited by Philip E. Agre (UC San Diego) and 
          Stanley J. Rosenschein (Teleos Research)

Recent computational research has greatly deepened our understanding of
agents' interactions with their environments.  The first round of
research in this area developed "situated" and "reactive" architectures
that interact with their environments in a flexible way.  These
"environments," however, were characterized in very general terms, and
often purely negatively, as "uncertain," "unpredictable," and the like.
In the newer round of research, psychologists and engineers are using
sophisticated characterizations of agent-environment interactions to
motivate explanatory theories and design rationales.  This research
opens up a wide variety of new issues for computational research.  But
more fundamentally, it also suggests a revised conception of computation
itself as something that happens in an agent's involvements in its
world, and not just in the abstractions of its thought.

The purpose of this special issue of Artificial Intelligence is to draw
together the remarkable variety of computational research that has
recently been developing along these lines.  These include:

 * Task-level robot sensing and action strategies, as well as projects
   that integrate classical robot dynamics with symbolic reasoning.

 * Automata-theoretic formalizations of agent-environment interactions.

 * Studies of "active vision" and related projects that approach
   perception within the broader context of situated activity.

 * Theories of the social conventions and dynamics that support activity.

 * Foundational analyses of situated computation.

 * Models of learning that detect regularities in the interactions
   between an agent and its environment. 

This list is only representative and could easily be extended to include
further topics in robotics, agent architectures, artificial life,
reactive planning, distributed AI, human-computer interaction, cognitive
science, and other areas.  What unifies these seemingly disparate
research projects is their emerging awareness that the explanation and
design of agents depends on principled characterizations of the
interactions between those agents and their environments.  We hope that
this special issue of the AI Journal will clarify trends in this new
research and take a first step towards a synthesis.  The articles in the
special issue will probably also be reprinted in a book to be published
by MIT Press.

The deadline for submitted articles is 1 September 1992.  Send articles

Queries about the special issue may be sent to the above address or to
