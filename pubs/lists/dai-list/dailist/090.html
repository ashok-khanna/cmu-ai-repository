human and artificial agents (CC, HC)

2) Modeling agents
- Agent architecture based upon beliefs, reasoning, actions,
communication, choice and evolution (GG, HC)
- Agent architecture based upon mental states (beliefs, knowledge,
actions, expectations, desires, and intentions) (JC1, MC2, LA)

3) Modeling users (students)
- With stereotypes (AP)
- Mathetics (formalizing learning and teaching processes) (AP)

4) Modeling societies
- Organizing bureaucratic agents in administrative organizations (LB)

5) Modeling agent reasoning

Subject: IC4 Conference (Preliminary Announcement)
Date: Tue, 15 Sep 92 8:58:07 CDT

The 4th OC3 conference will be held at the IC2 Institute in Austin, TX
on March 28-30, 1993.  As in the past, leading researchers and
practitioners from a wide range of backgrounds will present new ideas on
the impacts of computing on organizational structures and coordination
mechanisms, and new methodologies for software development in the
domain of business-oriented collaboration systems.  A unique feature of
the conference will involve Prof. Lynda Applegate leading a discussion
on two different cases that illustrate the potential of new computing
concepts to influence organizational processes.  Individuals who
register for the conference will be provided copies of the case to
study so that they can participate actively in the discussion.

                    CALL FOR PAPERS

       INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
                           IN 
           ACCOUNTING, FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT

   Special Issue on "Mathematical and Computational Models of
   Organizations: Models and Characteristics of Agent Behavior

The International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance
and Management (IJISAFM) is a heavily refereed journal published by John
Wiley.  A special issue on "Mathematical and Computational Models of
Organizations: Models and Characteristics of Agent Behavior," is being
co-edited by Professors Kathleen Carley
(Kathleen.Carley@centro.cs.cmu.edu -- Social and Decision Sciences,
Carnegie Mellon University), Les Gasser (Gasser@morue.usc.edu --
University of Southern California), Daniel O'Leary (oleary@mizar.usc.edu
-- School of Business, University of Southern California) and Michael
Prietula (mp2j@andrew.cmu.edu -- Carnegie Mellon University, Graduate
School of Industrial Administration).  Questions regarding the issue can
be directed to any of the co-editors.

The focus of papers can be on any aspect of mathematical and
computational models of organizations, with particular interest in
multiple agent models.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

1. Under what conditions does an organization exhibit learning or
intelligence greater than the sum of its agents?

2. How does organization theory relate to mathematical and computational
models of organizations?

3. How sophisticated do our models of intelligent agents need to be to
generate realistic organizational results?

4. What does organization theory gain by using more sophisticated models
of intelligent agents?

5. How should different types of agents be organized?

6. How do different types of negotiation strategies between agents
affect organizational behavior?

7. What is the empirical behavior of mathematical approaches?

8. How can an organization exhibit learning/intelligence greater than
the sum of the behavior of its agents?

A broad base of research approaches are considered appropriate for
consideration.

The deadline for paper submissions is February 28, 1993.  

As with all papers for the journal, four copies should be submitted to
