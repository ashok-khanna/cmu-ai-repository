Hi, I have a request. Does anyone know of any work being done on trust,
and the effects it can have on inter-'agent' relationships?
Specifically, I'd like to know of any work in the distributed AI area,
but anyone's thoughts on the subject would be interesting and useful.
I've written a few questions down that may help along the way...

How does trust enter into relationships?

Is trust an important factor in interagent discussions and communications?

How are cliques formed? (What role does trust play in this?)

Is a clique more succesful than an individual? Why?

Do we have different levels of trust?

Do we have different levels of information-secrecy? (And relate this to
trust levels?)

Thanks for your help.
Steve

PLEASE HELP ME CLARIFY THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERNCE BETWEEN (MA) AND (CDPS).

Referring to papers on Distributed Artificial Intelligence by Edmund H.
Durfee, Victor R. Lesser, and Daniel D. Corkill, CDPS is defined as a
research on how a loosely coupled network of problem solvers can work
together to solve problems that are beyond their individual
capabilities.  In CDPS, the agents or nodes have not always a global
problem to solve or a global goal to achieve as in Distributed Problem
Solving (DPS), but the agents may pursue their own set of local goals
and the systems' global behaviour may evolve thanks to the interactions
between the agents.

On the other hand, A.H. Bond and L. Gasser divide the world of DAI into
two primary arenas: Distibuted Problem Solving (DPS) and MultiAgent
systems (MA). In the second arena, (MA), research is concerned with
coordinate intelligent behaviour among a collection of (possibly
pre-existing) autonomous intelligent agents how they can cooprdinate
their knowledge, goals, skills and plans jointly to take action or to
solve problems. The agents may be working toward a single global goal,
or toward separte individual goals that interact.

  Now is there any difference between these two concepts?  If yes,
  please clarify.
