TITLE: Interaction Abstract Machines

AUTHORS: Jean-Marc Andreoli, Paolo Ciancarini and Remo Pareschi

ABSTRACT:

In this paper, we introduce the metaphor of Interaction Abstract
Machines (IAMs), in the same vein of such metaphors as the Chemical
Abstract Machine.  The main point about IAMs is in allowing interactions
among independent, locally defined subsystems---a crucial requirement
for capturing the global behavior of open systems.  IAMs amalgamate dual
concepts in distributed problem solving, such as blackboards and
broadcast communication, which are exploited to account for,
respectively, the tight integration and the loose integration of system
components.  The formal counterpart for the IAM metaphor can be found in
the computational model of Linear Objects (LO), whose aim is the
abstract modeling of concurrent agent-oriented computations and whose
operational semantics is given in terms of the proof theory of Linear
Logic, a framework recently introduced to provide a theoretical account
for the notion of (inter)action.

                   Junior Faculty Wanted!
     Vanderbilt University Center for Biomedical Informatics

     The Center for Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt University is
actively recruiting junior faculty able and willing to conduct leading
edge research in biomedical informatics.  One of the Center's long range
goals is to develop and demonstrate an organizational model linking
provision of the operation and decision support system infrastructure
with academic initiatives of biomedical informatics research and
training.  In addition, we seek to create a competitive edge for
Vanderbilt in the area of management and utilization of information as a
strategic resource.  Towards these ends we seek to fill several
research/clinical/staff (or some combination of the three) positions
within the medical center. Our current biomedical informatics research
initiatives are concentrated in five areas:

1.   The development of model system architectures.  An architecture
consists of methodologic or process related aspects and technical
components which must be provided to allow a systems infrastructure to
be made up of many individual pieces and yet to function as an
integrated whole.  New architectures will allow each user domain
(researchers, students or care providers) to have a system focused upon
their individual needs, while sharing the underlying resources.

2.   The development of structures to represent knowledge.  Such
structures permit mapping of the interrelationships of biomedical terms
and are necessary to integrate data and knowledge from multiple sources.
Such integration will let researchers collectively map the human genome,
learners bring multimedia resources to bear upon a question, and
clinical users intermix patient data with relevant knowledge sources.

3.   The investigation of techniques to present data so as to enhance
cognition.  Such techniques will permit a man-machine team to take
advantage of the human's ability to recognize patterns and the
computer's ability to remember and retrieve.  Graphics will help the
researcher detect trends, animations will let learners understand
interrelationships of concepts, and visual metaphors will alert
clinicians to significant combinations of findings.

4.   The investigation of methods of dealing with uncertainty.
Uncertainty is one of the key distinguishing features between a real
world environment and a test laboratory.  It must be resolved to know
how to guide a researcher to the correct resource, to evaluate a
learner's understanding, or to interpret changes in a patient's
condition.

5.   The development of methodologies to evaluate the impact of
informatics innovations on clinical, educational, research and
operational outcomes.  These methodologies will bring together ideas
from disciplines such as operations research, health science research,
epidemiology, statistics, and educational psychology.  New methodologies
are needed to separate the impact of the introduction of an innovation
from the effect of the many other changes which take place at the same
time in the complex biomedical environment.  Accurate assessment of
effectiveness is necessary both to redirect research efforts and to
justify major commitments of operational dollars.

     We are interested in receiving CVs from any National Library of
Medicine (NLM) trainees (or other interested parties) with an expected
completion/availability date of, or around, July, 1993.  For first
consideration, CV's should be received by November 1, 1992.

Subject: Call for Papers - Information Technology for Construction

     The Management of Information Technology for Construction
                  First International Conference
                           Singapore
                       17-20 August 1993

Conference Mission

The current use of Information Technology (IT) in construction is
unlikely to provide a strategic advantage either to practitioners and
the industry, or to clients and users of buildings.  There are many
reasons for this.  Unlike other sectors of the economy, the construction
industry is fragmented and not amenable to changes.  There are currently
no easy solutions, with or without IT, to achieve competitive advantage
or a better built-environment.  Changes in procedures, processes and
structure of organisations may be required if the most effective use of
IT is to be achieved.  These are unique challenges for the construction
industry.

It is timely to go beyond solutions which mimic and automate current
procedures and processes.  We must consider the wider impact of IT in
the next century and encourage the construction industry to evolve in a
way that maximizes the benefits to be gained from IT.  At the same time
we need to identify comprehensive solutions that must be developed.
Lessons can be learned by applying IT solutions borrowed from other
industries, such as integrating dissimilar CAD systems with programs for
cost, time and contract management, and the design of structure and
services subsystems.

Attempts to solve these problems appear fragmented at present.  A major
effort is thus needed at the international level to discuss the impact
of IT in the next century when the use of communications networks, new
media technologies and AI will be an integral part of the design,
construction and maintenance of buildings.  IT has the potential to
support and integrate the entire process in the life-cycle of the
built-form: from design to demolition.  IT can support and integrate
inter- and intraorganisational activities.  The aim of this conference
is therefore to plan and prepare a framework for such IT based support
systems.  A vision and an agenda for future research and development is
urgently required.

With this aim we invite you to contribute to a conference on this
important and urgent problem.  We solicit frameworks within which new
solutions will emerge rather than specific IT or computer solutions for
individual design or automation tasks.  We need a direction for change
for the construction industry in symbiosis with emerging IT Support
Systems (ITSS).

Conference Themes
IT Support Systems (ITSS) are needed to assist in the effective
management of the design and construction of buildings, the
built-environment, and the activities of the organizations within the
construction industry.  ITSS, which will integrate many aspects of the
design and construction process and inter- and intraorganisational
activities, may operate at many levels for:

A.  The Management of Organisations: Strategic IT planning for
competitive advantage.

B.  The Management of the Construction Process: IT for the total project
management function to coordinate the entire project.

C.  The Management of Design: Integrating diverse design functions of
the architect and the engineers; capturing knowledge (semantics) in the
design; conflict resolution and trade-offs.

D.  The Management of Information at the Project Level: The Project
Information System, which is constantly evolving from its embryonic form
at project inception into a complete product model that can be used for
construction, facilities management, and retrofitting.

E.  The Management of Information within Organizations: Enterprise
Information systems.  Specific information and knowledge bases to
support on-going projects mainly developed in-house.

F.  The Management of Information at Industry Level: Industry
Information Systems, Public and professional agencies providing access
to information bases through industry-wide communication networks.

G.  The Management of Resources: The management of labour, materials and
equipment within a project and the organisation.

H.  The Management of Knowledge: To capture knowledge (expertise) gained
from a project for use in future projects.  Human expertise is
unreliable and an organization may lose it altogether.

We welcome contributions in all of these areas.  It may be difficult to
separate subthemes as above because of the danger of segregating issues
in a cohesive problem, thus defeating the main aim of the conference.
Papers may thus address more than one of the sub-themes.  ITSS cannot
operate in isolation, and must be developed within an overall framework.
Each of the above themes is expected to recognise this and papers should
address sub- themes within the context of the overall conference
mission.

Submission of Abstracts
"MIT-Construction" Organising Committee invites you to submit a 250-word
ABSTRACT of original work for presentation at the conference.  Selected,
