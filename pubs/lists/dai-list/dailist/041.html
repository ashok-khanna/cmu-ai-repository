Subject: Full-time position for DAI researcher
Date: Wed, 10 Jul 91 12:13:00 EDT

Dear Colleague,

The DAI-LIST has recently helped us to fill a summer position in our
Distributed AI project at GTE Laboratories. We were very happy about
that. We now have an opening, described below, for a full-time DAI
researcher. The requirements for that position are described below.  I
would appreciate it very much if you would bring this opportunity to the
attention of those who might be interested and qualified.

_____________________
Position Description:

The Distributed AI project at GTE Laboratories is developing a
multiagent architecture for customer network control. Our mission is to
develop prototype cooperative systems for the next generation of
telecommunication operations support systems. We are taking a pragmatic
approach to agent-building and coordination of distributed problem
solvers: our current testbed uses agents based on PRODIGY planners and
we are also experimenting with various cooperative approaches to
multiagent fault management.

We are currently looking for a researcher with experience in Distributed
AI, multiagent planning or in closely related fields.  Telecommunication
expertise is not a prerequisite.  This person will be expected to
support the current project framework but also to assume leadership,
specifically in the area of interagent coordination.  The project is
multidisciplinary and, in addition to telecommunications aspects, it
also involves many areas of AI with which the candidate should be
familiar: planning, distributed agent architectures, computational
models of discourse, etc.

The position involves both systems level research and implementation
activities.  A solid computing background is required for this position.
Specific experience on UNIX platforms with demonstrated proficiency in
LISP is highly desirable.  Excellent communication skills and ability to
sustain good team interaction will be necessary.

1  Introduction

NTT Communication Science Laboratories were established as the 12th
laboratory of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation on July 4,1991.
This laboratory conducts basic research into computer science, with
emphasis on artificial intelligence, cryptography, and parallel
architecture.

    The main goal of NTT Communication Science Laboratories is to
contribute to the advances of computer science and basic research is
performed with a long range view.  In particular, many distributed
artificial intelligence (DAI) topics are being researched by the
artificial intelligence research group. Our research effort on DAI
ranges from multiagent problem solving algorithms, and models and
programming languages for describing agent's behavior.  Current research
topics and publications of interest are given in the next three
sections.

2  Multiagent Programming Language

2.1  Agent Oriented Programming

We are currently developing a programming language in which one can
program agents so that they cooperate by communicating with one another.
The language has the following features.

1) The language adopts a version of agent rationality: agents take
actions according to situations to fulfill their commitments.  In other
words, a program for an agent specifies actions that the agent should
take in a certain situation to fulfill its commitments. 2) Program is
regarded as a mentalistic notion such as knowledge and commitment.
Adopting modal and temporal logic to represent the mental states of the
agents, we express programs as logic sentences. 3) Communication
primitives based on the speech-act theory, such as informing and
requesting are provided. With these primitives, one can write programs
for agents so that they interact with one another.

      ming Language," Research Note, Information Processing
      Society of Japan, Vol. 90, No. 101, pp. 167-174, 1990 (in
      Japanese).

2.2  Multiagent Production System

Parallel production systems have been studied in two categories:
parallel rule matching, which aims to parallelize the matching process
to compress each production cycle; and parallel rule firing, which aims
to parallelize multiple rule firings to reduce the total number of
sequential production cycles.

   We are currently extending our theory of parallel rule firing to
create a basis for multiagent production systems, where multiple
production system programs compete or cooperate to solve a single or
multiple problems. An agent architecture based on metalevel control and
a new transaction model for multiple production systems are being
investigated.

      Procedural Programming Languages for Controlling Pro-
      duction Systems," IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelli-
      gence Application (CAIA), 1991.

3  Multiagent Problem Solving: Algorithm

3.1  Distributed Constraint Satisfaction

Viewing cooperative problem solving as distributed constraint
satisfaction provides a useful formalism for characterizing multiagent
techniques. We have formalized distributed constraint satisfaction
problems (DCSPs) and compared algorithms for solving them. In
particular, we have developed the new techniques called Distributed ATMS
(Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System) and Asynchronous
Backtracking that allow agents to act asynchronously and concurrently,
in contrast to the traditional sequential backtracking techniques
employed in constraint satisfaction problems. Our experimental results
show that solving DCSPs in a distributed fashion is worth while when the
problems to be solved by individual agents are loosely-coupled.

      Constraint Satisfaction Problems," Journal of Information
      Processing Society of Japan, Vol. 31, No. 1, pp. 106-114,
      1990 (in Japanese).

      tributed Constraint Satisfaction for DAI Problems," 10th
      Distributed Artificial Intelligence Workshop, Chapter 18,
      1990.

3.2  Cooperative Search

The motivation of this research is to find an algorithmic basis for
cooperative problem solving.  A typical exampleis to solve a maze with
two agents. One enters from the entrance and the other enters from the
exit. In such a problem, we found that the goal of each problem solver
changes dynamically in response to the decisions of the other problem
solver.

    Thus, as the first step towards cooperative search, we in-
vestigated the Moving Target Search (MTS) algorithm, where the location
of the target may change during the course of the search. We have proved
that if the average speed of the target is slower than that of the
problem solver, then the problem solver is guaranteed to eventually
reach the target.  An implementation with randomly positioned obstacles
confirms that the MTS algorithm is highly effective in various
situations. (This work has been done with Richard E. Korf of UCLA.)

      IJCAI-91, 1991 (to appear).

4  Multiagent Problem Solving:  Model

4.1    Negotiation

Negotiation is one of models for achieving coordination among agents. We
have developed a negotiation paradigm called `multistage negotiation' in
collaboration with V. R. Lesser (University of Massachusetts), S. E.
Conry and R. A. Meyer (Clarkson University).  This paradigm was
originally developed for restoring disrupted circuits in a
communications network and was extended for solving a distributed
constraint satisfaction problem.

    In multistage negotiation, an agent can acquire sufficient
information about the impact of its local decisions so that the agent
can make its local decisions that are correct from a global perspective
without providing complete internal information to all agents.

      tocol for Multistage Negotiation," 9th Workshop on Dis-
      tributed Artificial Intelligence, pp. 129-161, 1989.

   2. Susan E. Conry, Kazuhiro Kuwabara, Victor R. Lesser,
      and Robert A. Meyer, "Multistage Negotiation for Dis-
      tributed Constraint Satisfaction," IEEE Transactions on
      Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 1991 (to appear).

4.2    Organizational Adaptation

Research on Organizational Problem Solving aims to create a new paradigm
for adaptive multiagent problem solving in dynamically changing
environments.  Organization has emerged as a key concept for structuring
the activities of collections of problem-solvers.  Organization
self-design has been studied as an adaptive approach to long term,
strategic work-allocation and load-balancing.  We introduce two new
reorganization primitives, composition and decomposition. They change
the population of agents and the distribution of knowledge in an
organization.

    To create these primitives, we formalized organizational knowledge,
which represents knowledge of potential and necessary interactions among
agents in an organization. We developed computational organization
self-design techniques for agents with architectures based on production
systems to take advantage of the well-understood body of theory and
practice. (This work has been done with Les Gasser of USC.)

      tional Approach to Adaptive Production Systems," AAAI-
