This conference is designed to bring together researchers who are
investigating new methodologies, tools, and technologies for using
computer systems in organizations. As we move towards widespread
multimedia, globally distributed businesses and highly mobile workers,
electronic information movement and management will play a more
significant role in facilitating our work.  We want to address issues
related to this goal, including:

  -- Organizational computer systems
  -- Distributed AI, Expert Systems, and Multiple-Agent Models
  -- Parallel, Distributed, and Open Information Systems
  -- Object and Database Models and Systems
  -- Coordination and Collaborative Technology
  -- Information Economics
  -- Organizational Modeling, Planning and Coordination
  -- Social Aspects of Integrating and Using Information
  -- Multimedia Information, Storage, Retrieval, and Communications
  -- Portability and the Mobile Office
  -- Organizational Impact of Large Distributed Applications

*Formerly Conference on Office Information Systems (COIS)
