          11th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence
                    Amsterdam RAI International 
                   Exhibition and Congress Centre
                        The Netherlands
                       August 8-12, 1994

Organized by the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial
Intelligence (ECCAI) and hosted by the Dutch Association for Artificial
Intelligence (NVKI)

The European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) is the
European forum for scientific exchange and presentation of AI research.
The aim of the conference is to cover all aspects of AI research and to
bring together basic research and applied research.  The Technical
Programme will include paper presentations, invited talks, panels,
workshops, and tutorials. The conference is designed to cover all
subfields of AI, including non-symbolic methods.

ECAIs are held in alternate years and are organized by the European
Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI). The 11th
ECAI in 1994 will be hosted by the Dutch AI Society (NVKI). The
conference will take place at the Amsterdam RAI, International
Exhibition and Congress Centre.


E X H I B I T I O N
An industrial and academic exhibition will be organized from August 9 -
11, 1994.  Detailed information will be provided in the second call for
papers or can be obtained at the conference office (for the adress see
elsewhere).

                 C A L L  F O R  P A P E R S 

T O P I C S  O F  I N T E R E S T 

You are invited to submit an original research paper that represents a
significant contribution to any aspect of AI, including the principles
underlying cognition, perception, and action in humans and machines; the
design, application, and evaluation of AI algorithms and intelligent
systems; and the analysis of tasks and domains in which intelligent
systems perform. Theoretical and experimental results are equally
welcome. Papers describing innovative ideas are especially sought
providing such papers include substantial analysis of the ideas, the
technology needed to realize them, and their potential impact.

Of special interest this year are papers which address applied AI. Two
kinds of papers are sought. The first category is case studies of AI
applications that address significant real-world problems and which are
used outside the AI community itself; these papers must justify the use
of the AI technique, explain how the AI technology contributed to the
solution and was integrated with other components, and most importantly
explain WHY the application was successful (or perhaps why it failed) --
these "lessons learned" will be the most important review criteria. The
second category is for papers on novel AI techniques and principles that
may enable more ambitious real-world applications. All the usual AI
topics are appropriate. These papers must describe the importance of the
approach from an applications context, in sufficient technical detail
and clarity, and clearly and thoroughly differentiate the work from
previous efforts. There will be special prizes for the best papers in
both these areas.

S U B M I S S I O N  O F  P A P E R S

Authors are requested to submit to the Programme Chairperson 5 copies of
papers written in English in hardcopy format (electronic and fax
submissions will not be accepted).

Each submitted paper must conform to the following specifications.
Papers should be no longer than 5500 words including references. (Each
full page of figures counts as 1100 words.) Papers longer than this
limit risk being rejected without refereeing. A separate title page
should include the title, the name(s) of the author(s), complete
address(es), email, fax and telephone numbers, the specification of
between one and four Content Areas, preferably chosen from the list
below and an abstract (maximum 200 words). The title page should also
contain a declaration that the paper is unpublished, original work,
substantially different from papers currently under review and will not
be submitted elsewhere before the notification date other than to
workshops and similar specialized presentations with a very limited
audience. Papers should be printed on A4 or 8.5"x11" sized paper in
letter quality print, with 12 point type (10 chars/inch on a
typewriter), single spaced. Double sided printing is preferred.  Authors
who wish to check that their submission will fit into the final CRC
format will be able to obtain detailed instructions including a latex
style file and example postscript pages after October 15 by anonymous
FTP from agora.leeds.ac.uk, directory ECAI94, or by e-mailing
ecai94-style@scs.leeds.ac.uk with a message body of "help".

When submitting a paper an electronic mail message should also be sent
to ecai94-title@scs.leeds.ac.uk giving information in the format
specified below. If an intending author has no e-mail facilities then
this requirement is waived.

Papers should be sent to:

                       	CALL FOR PAPERS
THE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING SYSTEMS

Poznan, Poland, June 21-24, 1994

This conference encompasses the technical aspects of specifying,
modelling, designing, implementing, operating and evaluating distributed
computing systems and applications.  The technical areas covered
include:

- Distributed System Architecture and Shared Memory
- Distributed Operating Systems
- Distributed Databases and Information Systems
- Distributed System Services and Management
- Distributed Applications and Cooperative Work
- Communication Architectures and Protocols
- Languages, Tools, and Software Engineering
- Distributed Algorithms and Methods
- Real-Time and Continuous-Media Issues

Reliability / availability, performance, security, and coping with
heterogeneity are important aspects in all areas.  Of particular
interest are papers which address experiences with concrete distributed
systems and applications, and the impact of user / system mobility and
multimedia requirements on distributed system structures and algorithms.

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS
Authors are requested to submit six copies (in English) of their double-
space typed manuscript (maximum of 20 pages) with an abstract to Dr.
Svobodova by October 15, 1993.  The conference language is English and
final papers are restricted to eight IEEE model pages.  A submission
letter that indicates which of the conference areas is most relevant to
your paper must accompany the paper.  In case of multiple authors, an
indication of which author is responsible for correspondence and
preparing the camera-ready paper for the proceedings should also be

Supplementary information:

Poznan is the capital of the Wielkopolska Province, the cradle of the
Polish nation.  Situated halfway between Warsaw and Berlin, it is a
significant cultural, scientific, industrial, and commercial center.
Poznan has many interesting historical buildings, the most famous being
the 16th-century Renaissance Town Hall on the Old Market Square.  Poznan
is also a place of international fairs, which attract companies from the
whole world.  Consequently, Poznan has a rather substantial hotel
capacity in different price categories.

Poznan has a well-established technical university where research in
distributed systems and databases has been carried on since many years.
In March 1992, a new private school, the Franco-Polish School of New
Information and Communication Technologies was founded in Poznan.  This
school belongs to the system of the prestigious French "Grandes Ecoles"
of Telecommunications.  Next year, this school will have about 100
students, who, besides technical subjects, study intensively French and
English.

Conference site

ICDCS-14 will be held in the former castle from the 19th century, which
today serves as the cultural center.  Most of the tourist attractions
(the Old Town, museums, theaters) as well as hotels are within easy
walking distance from this building.

Participants

One of the main reasons why ICDCS will be held in Poland is to open it
up to the participants from the East/Central European countries.  Many
organizations and companies pledged to support the conference in order
to enable a broad participation from these countries.  A "Work in
Progress" session is planned to provide a forum for researchers whose
projects are not yet sufficiently well advanced to merit a full
conference paper.

Workshop on Services in Distributed and Networked Environments

This workshop is planned to be held in Prague, Czech Republic, June
27-28, 1994, that is, just after ICDCS-14.  Given enough interest, a
special bus will be organized to take those people who wish to
participate in both events from Poznan to Prague.  There are also direct
trains between the two cities as well as a regular bus service.
