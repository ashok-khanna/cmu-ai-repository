We have a new paper available, entitled "Computational Ecosystems in a
Changing Environment" by N. Glance, T. Hogg and B. A. Huberman, Xerox
PARC, Palo Alto, CA. 94304. The abstract reads as follows:

We study the adaptive behavior of a computational ecosystem in the
presence of time-periodic resource utilities as seen, for example, in
the day-night load variations of computer use and in the price
fluctuations of seasonal products.  We do so within the context of the
Huberman-Hogg model of such systems.  The dynamics is studied for the
cases of competitive and cooperative payoff functions with
time-modulated resource utilities, and the system's adaptability is
measured by tracking its performance in response to a time-varying
environment.
