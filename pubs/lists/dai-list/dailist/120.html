I am involved in a project investigating how computing can provide
"intelligent" agents/services to improve the functionality of existing
workflow technology. Some key areas we have identified for further
investigation include task assignment (computer-supported assignments of
tasks to agents based on an expressive model of the organization's
hierachy, resources, members, their skills, experience and workload
etc), exception handling (providing customizable policies for dealing
with contingencies like approaching/passed deadlines, missing resources,
changing requirements) and queue management (identifying opportunities
to reduce work by merging common subtasks across multiple tasks in an
individuals' work queue).

Just to give you an example, we have been investigating the use of
rationale capture technology to record the reasons for a given workflow
having a given structure to facilitate computer-supported workflow
modification in response to exceptional conditions such as resource
availability changes.

I would appreciate any pointers people can offer to publications or
research groups addressing this area, and would be glad to share the
pointers I already have.  Thanks.

Mark, to give some input relating to your query on intelligent flow
management based on rationale, you may know that we are working on a
number of task planning systems (based on Nonlin, O-Plan and O-Plan2)
including work with the the US government as part of the Planning
Initiative.  These all use goal structure/rationale capture as their
underlying process and plan representation.  in work with Japan, we have
done scheduling applications of the same architecture (a variant called
TOSCA - The Open SCheduling Architecture) in manufacturing.

We have put considerable thought into how the work we have done can be
used to link levels of business process modelling and strategic decision
making, tactical plan elaboration, and operational dispatch through
intelligent work flow management with explanation and rescheduling aids
based on process and plan rationale.

We have just won a large (2.4 milion pounds) project in the UK with
government support as part of the UK Itelligent Systems Integration
porgramme.  Our consortium involves 4 other groups to explore this
further.  We have explored our thinking with flow manager product
companies as we are sure that flow managers are the way to deliver the
benefits of the work we are doing.  This project is called ENTERPRISE.
Two user sites are involved in tnbe project.  AIAI is one of the main
technology providers.  This is effectively one of the large scale
enterprise integration pilots called for in the working sessions if the
First Conference on Enterprise Integration Modelling.

We have a number of projects internally and with clients which
instantiate parts of the overall ideas and are in productive use for
them.  Our HARDY diagramming aid (in C++) already allows for capture of
processes and defintion of processes, output of quality manuals and the
like.

                     Call for Participation
                    ACM Multimedia 93 Workshop on
                    Programming Abstractions for
                 Distributed Multimedia Applications

                          August 3, 1993
                        Anaheim, California

Workshop Description

This one day workshop is aimed at identifying high-level abstractions
that are suitable for expressing the communication and coordination
needs of distributed multimedia applications.  Today's networks support
only very general-purpose, low-level mechanisms (based on TCP/IP or
similar protocols) for programming such applications. This makes the
task of programming distributed multimedia applications very complex and
cumbersome.  A natural approach to overcome this complexity is to
provide a software layer that customizes the general-purpose, low-level
mechanisms for the specific task of developing distributed multi-media
applications. The ease and convenience of application development
depends crucially upon the suitability of the programming abstractions
provided by this layer.

Experience with distributed multimedia applications so far suggests that
there are two important classes of abstractions that address independent
functional aspects of networked multimedia applications: session (also
called conference) abstractions, and transport abstractions. The session
abstractions provide mechanisms for coordinating the activities of
agents involved in a communication session.  They may also provide
mechanisms for negotiation among the agents to resolve conflicting
policies and requirements of the agents.  Connections among these agents
are described by the transport abstractions.

The workshop addresses issues in developing effective abstractions for
conveniently programming distributed multimedia applications, and
involves the participation of researchers from a variety of areas
including:  multimedia communications, computer communications,
information networking, telecommunications, real-time systems, open
distributed systems, software engineering, and programming languages.

Workshop Format:
     The workshop is organized around the following main activities: a
set of invited talks that cover the foundations and state-of-the-art in
public network and internet based multimedia communications, and several
expert panels focusing upon:

1. Initiation and management of sessions.

2. Specification of processing, presentation and transport of multimedia
streams.

3. Mechanisms for describing, accessing and managing network and
application provider services.

The aspects covered under each of these topics include:  convenience and
expressive power of abstractions, separation of concerns, security and
privacy, mechanisms for policy enforcement, fault-tolerance, network
resource optimization, extensibility and application interoperability.

Workshop Location:
     The workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM Conference on
Multimedia (sponsored by SIGBIO, SIGCHI, SIGCOMM, SIGGRAPH, SIGIR,
SIGLINK, and SIGOIS) In Anaheim, California. Participation in the
workshop is free of charge, but participants must register for the ACM
Multimedia 93 in order to attend the workshop.

			Call For Papers
     KI-93 Workshop on Communication, Coordination and Cooperation 
                      in Multiagent Systems

In the framework of the 17. (engl. Bezeichnung der Fachtagung) for
Artificial Intelligence,September 13-16, 1993, Humboldt University,
Berlin and in connection with a meeting of the GI Fachgruppe
1.1.6.Distributed Artificial Intelligence of the German Society for
Informatics (GI).

Topics:
A central problem of distributed AI is the adequate description of
communication in support of coordination and cooperation in multiagent
systems.  Some traditional applications are tailored specifically to a
particular application thereby mixing different levels of abstraction.
Others lean heavily on the speech-act theory and have difficulties using
it for describing dialogues. At least three aspects are to be
distinguished:
* Connection to OSI/ISO layer model
* Structure of the co-operation protocols from message types to dialogues
* Relationship to metalayer, which is relevant for adequate protocol
selection.

Even though many details are being discussed controversially by the DAI
community the necessity of a communication standard for multiagent
systems is not contested. Goal and approach The workshop goal is to
place known approaches into a common framework for reasons of
comparision and thereby advancing the standardization efforts. The
organizers of the workshop attempt to reach a targeted concentrated and
structured discussion at the workshop.

* Introductory lectures
  communication and cooperation,
  coordination & cooperation
* selected lectures
* comparison and classification of the talks in a summary 
* Discussion, specifically addressing the following questions:
* What does the interface to ordinary communication look like?
* What is the purpose of a standard for communication protocols?
	(Can KQML serve as a model for such a standard?)
* What levels of abstraction are to be distinguished?
* How are task-specific protocols (e.g., for task assignment) and
domain-specific protocols (e.g. for manufacturing) dealt with in the
context of standards.

Participants who intend to give a lecture are requested to send a
three-page extended abstract to the organizers. Addressing the questions
given above will be welcomed. All lecturers will receive the selected
contributions of the other lecturers in advance and are requested to
establish a relation to their work.  After the workshop all
contributions, summaries of discussions and a summary of the workshop
will be mailed to the participants.

Deadlines:
May 28, 1993  Submission of Contributions
July 1, 1993  Notification about acceptance of participation or
contribution.  Everybody who has registered for KI-93 is invited to
participate.
