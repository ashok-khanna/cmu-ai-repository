Below are references to two articles concerning collective
problem-solving that might be of interest to the DAI community -- they
certainly are fascinating in their own right.  Also, the March 1990
issue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences has peer commentary on an article
titled "Can a Species be Intelligent?"

Nigel R. Franks, "Army Ants: A Collective Intelligence,"  AMERICAN
SCIENTIST, March-April 1989, pp 139-146.

Thomas D. Seeley, "The Honeybee Colony as a Superorganism,"
AMERICAN SCIENTIST, November-December 1989, pp 546-553.
