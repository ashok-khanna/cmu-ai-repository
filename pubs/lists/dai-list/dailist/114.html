Subject: Thesis on Distributed Automated Deduction

Dear readers,

I am working in distributed automated deduction.

By automated deduction I mean theorem proving in first order logic with
equality, with inference rules like resolution, paramodulation, i.e.,
"expansion" rules, and subsumption and simplification, i.e.,
"contraction" (or deletion) rules. (This is not meant to be exclusive.)

By distributed automated deduction, I mean the possibility of having
several concurrent, asynchronous, deductive processes working to the
solution of the given theorem proving problem.

I recently graduated from SUNY at Stony Brook with a thesis on this
subject.  For those interested, I am appending an extended version of my
thesis abstract.

TITLE:			Distributed Automated Deduction
AUTHOR:			Maria Paola Bonacina
ADVISOR:		Prof. Jieh Hsiang
SCHOOL:			Dept. of Computer Science, SUNY at Stony Brook
GRADUATION DATE:	December 1992

ABSTRACT:

This thesis comprises five main contributions:

1. an abstract framework for theorem proving,
2. an analysis of the parallelizability of theorem proving strategies,
3. a methodology for parallel theorem proving in a distributed
   environment, termed deduction by "Clause-Diffusion",
4. a study of special topics in distributed deduction with contraction
5. and an implementation, the theorem prover "Aquarius",
   of the Clause-Diffusion methodology.

1.  In our abstract framework, Knuth-Bendix type completion procedures
are treated as semidecision procedures for theorem proving, rather than
procedures to generate confluent systems.  A theorem proving derivation
is conceived as a process of reducing a proof of the target or goal.
Accordingly, all the fundamental notions of contraction inference rules,
redundancy of clauses, refutational completeness of the inference
mechanism and fairness of the search plan, are defined in a
target-oriented fashion.  The most important feature of our framework is
that it provides the first notion of fairness for theorem proving, which
is weaker than the fairness property required to generate confluent
systems.  A weaker fairness requirement means that fewer inference steps
are necessary.  Therefore, a weaker fairness requirement is a
theoretical precondition to the design of more efficient theorem proving
strategies.

2.  We classify three classes of theorem proving strategies, i.e.,
Subgoal-reduction strategies, Expansion-oriented strategies, and
Contraction-based strategies, and three types of parallelism, i.e.
parallelism at the Term level (fine grain), parallelism at the Clause
level (medium grain) and parallelism at the Search level (coarse grain).
We analyze the applicability of these three types of parallelism to
strategies in the three above classes with respect to several issues,
including:  how dynamic is the data base of clauses during the
derivation, the possibility of conflicts between parallel inferences,
the duplication of clauses, whether the memory is shared or distributed,
and more.  The result of this analysis is that while subgoal-reduction
strategies are amenable to all three types of parallelism, and
expansion-oriented strategies still admit both parallelism at the clause
level and parallelism at the search level, only parallelism at the
search level is suitable for contraction-based strategies.  The abundant
use of contraction rules, which makes these strategies so efficient in
sequential execution, makes their parallelization more challenging.

3.  The Clause-Diffusion methodology realizes parallelism at the search
level, by having concurrent, asynchronous, deductive processes searching
in parallel the search space of the problem.  The search space is
partitioned among the processes by distributing the clauses and by
subdividing certain classes of inferences.  The processes communicate by
exchanging data and they halt successfully as soon as one of them finds
a proof.  Policies for distributing the clauses and for scheduling
inference and communication steps complete the picture.  While the
Clause-Diffusion methodology applies to theorem proving in general, it
has been designed to provide solutions to the problems in the
parallelization of contraction-based strategies, since they have been
among the most successful.  We describe backward contraction, i.e., the
task of maintaining clauses reduced in a dynamically changing data base,
as the main obstacle in parallel theorem proving with contraction.  If a
finer granularity of parallelism is adopted, e.g., parallelism at the
clause level in shared memory, this difficulty appears as a
write-bottleneck, which we have called the Backward Contraction
Bottleneck.  The Clause-Diffusion approach avoids this problem by
adopting a mostly distributed memory and new distributed global
contraction schemes.

4.  We have given a definition of distributed derivations and
characterized their fairness requirements, including fairness of
inferences and fairness of communication.  We have shown that the
Clause-Diffusion methods are fair.  Also, we have observed that the
uncontrolled application of subsumption in a distributed data base may
violate the fairness and the monotonicity - a dual property of soundness
- of distributed derivations.  This discovery has propelled a
reexamination of the subsumption inference rule, which we view as a
replacement rule, rather than a deletion rule.  Our new distributed
subsumption inference rule preserves both fairness and monotonicity,
without reducing the contraction power of subsumption.

5.  We conclude with the description of the distributed theorem prover
Aquarius, including some experiments, and with directions for future
research, such as the design of Parallel Search Plans.

Subject: Request for info on DAI tools and testbeds
Date: Thu, 1 Apr 93 16:56:05 +0100

Hello netters and news readers!

I am in the process of doing a survey in Distributed AI regarding two
specific areas of DAI software/systems:
	- tools 
	- testbeds

As AI people's understanding of tools and testbeds can be quite
different (experience :-)), I give a characterization of the kind of
things that in my opinion qualify for these two areas below (after the
signature).

I am very grateful for every hint I get.  For both kinds of systems,
please specify in every case
	- the name of the system
	- a contact (author, implementer, provider of further info)
	- an abstract of its functionality
	and, if possible
	- implementation language and state (in use, in development))
	- availability (commercial/proprietary/public domain)
	- how to use it
	- how to integrate it in DAI sw systems
	- other relevant info (ftp source: host, Internet-Id, dir)

Please respond via email to gkk@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de.  I will collect
the responses and mail/post a summary to all the newsgroups/lists I
posted this article to (probably around end of April).  Also, most
likely a report from our research institute will be available on the
topic.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation!

So long,
Gerhard K. Kraetzschmar                      FORWISS

Things that qualify for DAI tools:

The general idea here is to substantially reduce the effort needed for
implementing DAI systems, e.g., by providing a framework for multiple
agents communicating via a specific protocol, etc. That is, I look for
software systems and utilities that implement specific DAI concepts,
technologies or architectures, such as (just a few examples)
- an implementation of the contract net protocol
- an implementation of a distributed TMS
- an system that allows for easy configuration and programming of
	multi-agent systems with a specific architecture
- the implementation of a mechanism for enabling/ensuring cooperative
	behavior between agents
- the implementation of a mechanism for resolving conflicts between
	competing/non-competing agents
Note, that the software should provide significantly more support than
e.g., CommonLisp + C interface + TCP-IP + (lightweight) processes, and
one or more DAI technologies should be more or less directly applicable.

Things that qualify for DAI testbeds:

Software environments, that allow testing and evaluation of DAI systems,
such as multiagent systems (MAS) and (cooperative,) distributed problem
solvers ((C)DPS). They must provide functionality to define and simulate
an environment for the DAI system to be evaluated in, as well as an
interface to the DAI system. Certain restrictions, like "can interface
only via TCP/IP" or "good only for LISP-implemented agents" are
acceptable. The testbed must provide functionality to perform
experiments with a DAI system under varying environment conditions,
record internal data of the DAI system during experiments for later
evaluation, and enable the experimenter to repeat experiments and
reconstruct critical or interesting situations.

An essential criterion is that the testbed should allow (and actually
has been used) to test and evaluate more than one specific DAI system or
architecture. Probably there are more testbeds around that do NOT meet
this essential criterion; if this is the case, please send info, but do
clearly state that testbed X has been developed to evaluate DAI system
Y, but (in theory/with some work/easy but not done) could be used to
evaluate DAI system Z as well.

Subject: Request for information on distributed reason maintenance
Date: Thu, 1 Apr 93 17:01:12 +0100

Hello netters and news readers!

Together with several colleagues I am working on
	-> distributed reason maintenance 
(reason maintenance in distributed systems, e.g., multiagent systems)
and
	-> distributed belief revision
(belief revision in distributed systems, e.g., multiagent systems).
We know of several other efforts in this regard, including
	- DTMS (Bridgeland/Huhns)
	- BRTMS (Horstmann)
	- DATMS (Mason/Johnson)
and, e.g., the thesis of Afzal Ballim announced previously here.

However, we appreciate any further helpful comments or references.
Any hint is welcome!

Please respond via email (do not post to this list or newsgroup) to
	gkk@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de
I will collect the responses and mail/post a summary to all the 
newsgroups/lists I posted this article to.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation!

Subject: IJCAI Workshop on Knowledge Sharing and Information Interchange
Date: Thu, 1 Apr 1993 07:07:23 -0800

			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

    IJCAI'93 Workshop on Knowledge Sharing and Information Interchange

                   August 28th, 1993 - Chambery, FR

Connecting Knowledge Based Systems (KBSs) with conventional software or
with other KBSs poses problems of knowledge sharing and information
interchange.  Possible solutions of knowledge representation problems
are the subject of intense discussions in the American AI Community and
in Europe through European Community ESPRIT funded research projects,
academic research, and the newly formed EuroKnowledge initiative.

This one-day Workshop during IJCAI'93 will confront the different
approaches on Knowledge Sharing and Information Interchange and promote
communication between researchers.

The following subtopics are of interest for the Workshop (others can be
considered):
    * a common language for knowledge interchange (scope, semantics,
      syntax), 
    * translation/mapping from a formalism to the common language,
    * generic ontologies,
    * use of a single knowledge representation formalism for the
      development of all KBSs,
    * reuse of existing KBs (methodological issues, standards).
    * potential of a standard query language/communication protocol.

Organization:
   The maximum number of attendees is 35. The language is English.  For
each subtopic, several position statements will be made.  Follow up
discussions are then planned. The aim of this workshop is to promote an
open exchange of ideas rather than a formal speaker/audience format.  A
round table will be organized to conclude the day.  The Contact Person
will assure the organization of minutes taking and production of the
synthesis of the Workshop.  Several overviews will be added to this
report:
     * the DARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort,
     * the EuroKnowledge initiative,
     * the IMKA effort.

Submission:

People wishing to present a communication (about 15 minutes) at the
workshop should submit a short position paper (about 1700 words).  Other
persons wishing to attend the workshop should submit a short
presentation paper (about 500 words) describing why their contribution
to the workshop would be of interest (i.e. the research they have been
conducting in the domain or in a related domain).

Three copies (hard copy, Latex on e-mail or fax) have to be sent to the
contact person. Papers must include: author's name(s), affiliation, main
field of specialization, complete postal address, phone and fax number,
and e-mail.

Schedule:
   position paper, intention of participation:  April 23 
   Notifications:                               May 3
   Final copies of position papers:             July 2


Practical information:
   According to the IJCAI'93 organization, each workshop attendee must
have registered for the main conference. The fee of the workshop are an
additional 300 FF (about 55 $)
