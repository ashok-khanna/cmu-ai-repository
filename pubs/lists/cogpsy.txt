A new mailing list has been started. The main aim of this 
mailing list is to inform about connectionist research in 
cognitive psychology. The mailing list is primarily intended
for discussion of issues relating to cognitive psychology 
and connectionism and the dissemination of information
directly relevant to researchers in the fields of cognitive
science. Examples of information are announcements of new
techreports, dissertations, theses, conferences, seminars,
or information about articles, research, or information  
about bibliographic issues.

Requests to have a name added to the list, and similar
administrative matters, should be sent to the following
address:
        cogpsy-request@phil.ruu.nl
        
Contributions can be sent to:
