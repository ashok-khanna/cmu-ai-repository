REVERSIBLE GRAMMAR IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

Edited by Tomek Strzlakowski


PREFACE


Reversible Grammar


The notion that a single grammar could be used in natural language analysis and
generation is by no means a surprising one. Intuitively we feel that it should
be possible to propose a set of rules or principles which would define the class
of well-formed expressions of a given language independently of any particular
task. Yet despite the variety of linguistic theories available today this result
remained elusive until recently. In the past few years, however, there has been
an increasing interest in using reversible and bidirectional grammars in natural
language processing.  Significant new results have emerged from research in
theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics and computer science.


What is a reversible grammar? To a degree at least the answer may depend on
whom we ask. A linguist may say that a reversible grammar is a specification
of a language that can be used for both analysis and synthesis of well-formed
expressions. Since a grammar can be viewed as a transducer between linguis-
tic surface strings and some internal representations of meaning, reversibility
means the ability to perform such translations in both directions, using in each
case the same grammar.  The practical aspects of this bidirectionality are by
no means trivial, and involve completeness and soundness of the linguistic cov-
erage, redundancy and ambiguity of representation, sharability of information,
and various types of preferences.


A computational linguist, on the other hand, will primarily be concerned with
how to construct efficient programs that can interpret a given grammar:  as
a parser (to recognize well-formed strings and assign them appropriate rep-
resentations), as a generator (to produce appropriate surface strings given an
internal representation of meaning and speaker's intentions), or both (to create
a program that can accomplish either task). These three options can be further
elaborated as follows:



  1.A grammar can be compiled into two separate programs of a parser and


                                 ix

    a generator with each program requiring a different evaluation strategy,
    though possibly within a uniform architecture.

  2.The parser and the generator are separate programs but they are exe-
    cutable using the same evaluation strategy, e.g., top-down left-to-right,
    and therefore are inverses of each other.

  3.There is only one program implementing both the parser and the generator
    and the evaluation strategy can handle it being run in either direction, 
    e.g., head-driven evaluation.



Each of these options touches on different computational problems of attaining
reversibility, thus showing yet another aspect of reversible grammar.  While
option (1) is primarily a compilation problem, options (2) and (3) must deal
directly with program reversibility, a problem discussed by various researchers
including [7], [3], and [21]. Options (2) and (3) may in fact be considered as
opposite ends of an entire spectrum of options. Those closer to (2) assume
existence of a cheap, but restrictive evaluation strategy, such as the depth-
first left-to-right, and thus restrict the class of bi- and multi- directional 
programs to a small, uninteresting set. Therefore a uni-directional program
needs to be inverted for computation in the reverse. As we move away from (2) 
and towards (3), the restrictions upon the evaluation strategy are relaxed, 
and the class of bidirectional programs grows, and so does the cost of 
computation; however, no explicit program inversion is required.


Exploring bidirectionality of natural language processing has long been believed
desirable for reasons to be summarized below, and this viewpoint has been reit-
erated by many researchers (e.g., [11], [8], [1], [19], [4]). One of the earlier
works emphasizing the significance of bidirectionality in natural language proc-
essing was [13], which presented a simple system for translating short para-
graphs in English into semantic network representation and generating English 
summaries from the semantic networks using, in both cases, the same Horn clause
program.  At the same time, it has been common knowledge that except for
very simple systems, a straightforward application of e.g., a natural language
parser to a generation task faced very serious efficiency problems, especially
within chiefly procedural systems such as DIAGRAM [9].  The emergence of
unification-based linguistic formalisms [2], [8], [10] has paved the way for 
vigorous research on reversibility which eventually led to practical results.1
 
 
What are the advantages that we may expect from a bidirectional natural
___________
  1 Unification, being an associative and commutative operation, lends itself 
naturally to inversion.

language system beyond its mathematical properties? Among the arguments
for adopting a bidirectional design in natural language processing the following
are perhaps the most widely shared:



    A bidirectional natural language system, or a system whose inverse can
    be derived by a fully automated compile-time process, greatly reduces the
    effort required for system development, since we need to write only one
    program or specification instead of two. This is especially true if creating
    the single specification does not require substantial extra effort as com-
    pared to one-directional design. The actual amount of savings ultimately
    depends upon the extent to which the system is made bidirectional, for
    example, how much of the language analysis process can be inverted for
    generation.

    Using a single grammar underlying both the analysis and the synthesis
    processes leads to more accurate capturing of the language. Although no
    natural language grammar can be guaranteed to be complete, the gram-
    mars used in parsing tend to be unsound, in that they frequently over-
    accept, i.e., accept some ill-formed strings as legitimate sentences.  This
    becomes immediately visible when a parser is run in the reverse on the rep-
    resentations it produces. The grammars used for generation, on the other
    hand, are usually made "too tight" as a result of limiting their output to
    the "best" surface forms. It is clear that such grammars are dramatically
    incomplete for parsing. A reversible system for both parsing and genera-
    tion requires a finely balanced grammar which is sound and as complete
    as possible.  Writing a balanced grammar puts more pressure upon the
    linguist but, it should also be noted, a reversible grammar can serve as a
    powerful debugging tool in building such systems.

    A reversible grammar provides, by design, a match between a system's
    analysis and generation capabilities, which is especially important in in-
    teractive systems.  A discrepancy in this capacity may mislead the user,
    who tends to assume that what is generated as output is also accept-
    able as input, and vice-versa. While this match can often be achieved in
    non-reversible systems where the parser and the generator are constructed
    independently of one another, it comes at the cost of a substantial effort.

    Finally from the computational viewpoint a bidirectional system can be
    expected to be more robust, certainly easier to maintain and modify, and
    altogether more perspicuous.

Contents of this volume


This volume contains 15 papers representing varying perspectives on reversible
grammars: from a linguistic and psychological phenomenon to a computational
property of certain classes of programs to an application tool.  The papers
give an up-to-date and highly representative review of this active research 
field and its impact on other areas of computational linguistics including 
natural language generation, machine translation, semantic and pragmatic 
processing.  I attempted to subdivide these articles into 6 thematic groups 
each containing 2 or 3 closely related papers, as follows:



  1.Linguistic Theory group including papers by Marrafa and Saint-Dizier,
    Dymetman, and Newman and van Noord. Papers in this groups concen-
    trate on selected linguistic aspects of reversibility.

  2.Uniform Architecture group including papers by Zajac, Ishizaki, and Hasida.
    These papers discuss problems of uniform architecture in language analysis
    and synthesis tasks.

  3.Reversible Computation group including papers by Block and Strzalkowski.
    These papers consider computational aspects of reversible grammars and
    reversible computation.

  4.Shared Preferences and Knowledge group including papers by Barnett,
    Fedder and McDonald. Papers in this group investigate different knowl-
    edge requirements and preferences of analysis and synthesis processes.

  5.Machine Translation group including a paper by Estival and a paper by
    Barnett, Mani and Rich. Application of reversible grammars in machine
    translation research is discussed.

  6.Systemic Grammar group including papers by Fawcett and O'Donoghue.
    These papers present a different and somewhat dissenting view on re-
    versible grammar from a generative perspective.



Marrafa and Saint-Dizier present a natural language processing formalism based
on type construction principles, inspired by the work of Ait-Kaci, and const-
raint logic programming. Their approach to reversibility assumes one declarative
grammar from which two separate parser and generator machines are derived.
These machines operate under similar architectures, but reflect differences one
may expect to occur between language analysis and synthesis tasks. The for-
malism is demonstrated in applications to secondary predication and small
clauses in Portugese.

Dymetman discusses two distinct notions of reversibility: one understood as
uniformity of implementation of parsing and generation, and the other as an
inherent property of certain grammars. This paper attempts to define formal
characteristics of a reversible grammar, understood as a transducer between
linguistic representations, using the notion of finite enumerability of parsing
and generation.


Newman and van Noord investigate some implications of the use of reversible
grammars in natural language generation systems, particularly upon the tra-
ditional separation of the generation task into strategic and tactical compo-
nents. They argue that a strict integration of parsing and generation equipped
with some monitoring mechanism is necessary to achieve a flexible and efficient
system, e.g., one that can generate unambiguous utterances. In this paper, re-
versibility is regarded as a primarily computational relation between a 
linguistic transducer's input and output.


Zajac's paper describes a uniform computational architecture for developing
reversible grammars, to be used in parsing, generation and bidirectional trans-
fer in machine translation. He opts for complete bidirectionality where there is
only one grammar and one evaluator program which uses a highly flexible evaluat-
ion strategy in which directionality depends only upon specification of input. 
This is realized through a declarative rewriting system of typed feature 
structures (TFS) in which both the grammar and transfer rules can be encoded.


Ishizaki discusses a design of a reversible system architecture that includes 
handling of pragmatic information (in addition to syntax and semantics). At the
core of this design is a reversible deductive engine that extends deduction with
abductive assumptions.  The paper distinguishes between reversible architec-
ture (with one processing module) and a bidirectional architecture where two
separate modules (a parser and a generator) share a common set of constraints.


Hasida extends the notion of uniform architecture beyond the problems of pars-
ing and generation and presents a generalized set of constraints for controlling
computation of any kind. He demonstrates how efficient computational schemes
for parsing and generation emerge automatically from this overall design.


Block's paper introduces Trace and Unification Grammar (TUG) formalism, a
reversible unification grammar system based on Chomsky's Government and Binding
theory. In this system reversibility is viewed as an ability to translate a 
single grammar into two distinct programs for parsing and generation. The parser
(using LR(k) technique) and the generator (a head-driven process) reflect 
different perspectives on language processing in not sharing either an

evaluation strategy or an architectural design.


Strzalkowski discusses a general computational method for inverting a unifica-
tion-based parser into an efficient generator. This paper concentrates on com-
putational aspects of reversibility presenting a detailed algorithm for inver-
ting and optimizing uni-directional programs.  Various efficiency problems 
related to left-recursion, non-determinancy, and local and global information 
flow in logic grammars are resolved.


Barnett's paper discusses the problem of preferences in parsing and generation:
in parsing they lead one to select the best interpretation for an utterance, in
generation the most appropriate utterance is selected to express a meaning.
He points out that while many of these preferences can be shared by both
processes (e.g., low attachment of prepositional phrases), others may be more
problematic (e.g., anaphora resolution). Several strategies for making prefer-
ences bidirectional are proposed.


Fedder describes a method of augmenting a grammar with pragmatic and
discourse-level information that can provide preferences in sentence generation.
The paper attempts to determine the information that a bidirectional grammar
needs to possess and examines the complexity of the resulting system.


McDonald's main argument is that a reversible natural language system must
involve a knowledge base of the language user, and that the pivot point - where
parsing ends and generation begins - is quite close to speaker/hearer mental
representation.  He points out that while a single linguistic representation is
desirable and natural, parsing and generation are unlikely to follow the same
algorithm for efficiency reasons. This paper also outlines a reversible 
architecture involving Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) and `exploded tree 
families'.


Estival discusses an application of reversible grammar technology to machine
translation.  She points out that while a direction-neutral description of lan-
guage is possible and desirable, the same program cannot be effectively used for
both analysis and generation tasks. Grammar reversibility is viewed primarily
as a sharable declarative grammar from which two separate and potentially
quite different programs for parsing and generation are derived.


Barnett, Mani and Rich take on the problems of interlingua-based reversible
machine translation between languages that are not ordinarily easy to line up,
e.g., English and Japanese. A closest-fit generation algorithm for lexical 
choice is described as a version of head-driven generation method.

Fawcett presents a `generationist' view of grammar reversibility, from the per-
spective of systemic grammar which, unlike most other grammars, has been
primarily used in generation.  In this somewhat dissenting view a semantic
interpreter, and not the parser, is to be taken as an inverse of the generator.


O'Donoghue's paper follows up on Fawcett's and discusses details of an inverted
generator system used for semantic interpretation within the systemic grammar
framework. This work represents an approach which is opposite to the usual
parser-to-generator inversion.
