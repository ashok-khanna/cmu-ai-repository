\chapter*{Using the Kluwer Academic Publishers LaTeX Macro Package}

\section*{Technical Book Style}
Welcome to the use of the Kluwer \LaTeX\ macro package for the 
production of technical books to be published by Kluwer Academic Publishers.
You will find that most of the
commands found in the \LaTeX\ book will work exactly the same with
the use of this package. The few new commands, or commands that
are used somewhat differently will be shown here, followed
by a set of sample pages. The sample pages will be interspersed
with pages of the \LaTeX\ code that produced them, so 
that by comparing the code with the results
you can quite quickly see how to use the commands needed to
format your article.

If you are preparing an article for an edited book, please see the
documentation for edited books,\hfill\break editedbk.doc.

If you find that you are having a problem {\bf after you have read
this documentation carefully}, help may be had by sending email
to Suzanne Rumsey at {\tt prod@world.std.com}. If possible,
please email a small sample file demonstrating your problem.

\LaTeX\ is run on booksamp.tex.



\subsection*{The Basic Style}

The basic documentstyle for Kluwer books is `kluwerbk'. 

\verb+\documentstyle{kluwerbk}+

\subsection*{Font style files}
The default font selection will be Computer Modern, but
the user can choose to use PostScript fonts, which will give
the book a more finished look. Your choice should be determined
by which fonts you have available on your system. Most likely the final
version of your book will be produced using PostScript fonts but in the
earlier versions it is fine to print your book using Computer Modern fonts.

There is no difference in the use of the macros in 
whether or not you use PostScript. You may notice that
the command \verb+\bit+ which will produce bold italics
with the PostScript font file, but will produce Computer Modern bold when 
the cmfonts file is used.

The optional style file
`{\tt[psfonts]}' is used for PostScript font declarations, used like this:

\verb+\documentstyle[psfonts]{kluwerbk}+

\vtop to0pt{
\subsubsection*{Changes in the psfonts.sty file}
If you do use PostScript fonts, you may need to make changes in 
the psfonts.sty
file to make the PostScript font name match the names available on
your system. The PostScript names vary according to what driver
program (dvips, dvi2ps, dvipsone, etc.) you use to translate
your .dvi file into PostScript to appear on your printer. The naming
conventions used here are those used by the Arbortext dvips driver.

There are comments in the psfonts.sty file to show you where to make
the changes, and what the Adobe font names are for each font named.
\vss}
\newpage

If you look in your directory where the .tfm files are stored, you
can find the names of your PostScript fonts. Then you can
change the psfonts.sty file, as in the following examples.


Part of the original file:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
...
%% Times-Roman
\def\timesroman{psmtimr }

%% Times-Bold
\def\timesbold{psmtimb }
...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

Changed version, using the Y\&Y font names:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
...
%% Times-Roman
\def\timesroman{tirx }

%% Times-Bold
\def\timesbold{tibx }
...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode



\subsection*{Double Space Option}
You may also use the {\tt dblspace} option to increase the vertical 
distance between lines in your text, to make an easy to
read draft version of your article. Use one of the following
documentstyle declarations:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentstyle[psfonts,dblspace]{kluwerbk}
\documentstyle[dblspace]{kluwerbk}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{Edited book style}
To make an edited book for Kluwer, you must use the
optional style file, editedbk.sty, i.e.,

\begin{verbatim}
\documentstyle[psfonts,editedbk]{kluwerbk}
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Please see the documentation that is written specifically for
edited books:\hfill\break editedbk.doc.}

\subsection*{New Use for Double Backslashes}
Double backslashes maybe used to start a new line in the
title, chapter title, author names, appendix title, and section heads.

For instance:\verb+\section{This is a\\ Test Section Head}+

\t
\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\section{This is a\\ Test Section Head}
\endt


\newpage

\section*{Front Matter Commands}
This section shows the beginning commands in the preparation of your book.
A full sample is found on the next section `Sample Front Matter'.

The user should enter the following commands underneath
the \verb+\begin{document}+ command:

\begin{verbatim}
\title{(Title of Book)}
\end{verbatim}
Double backslashes may be used to arrange the lines in the
book title on the title page.

\begin{verbatim}
\author{(First LAST)}
\affil{(Author affiliation)}
\location{(Author location)}
\end{verbatim}

This set of three commands should be used for each author.
All three are needed for correct macro functioning.
Note that the author's last name should be entered in all caps.

If you want to have several authors, with a single affiliation,
you may separate authors with a double backslash.

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Carolyn SMYTHE\\ George SANTAYANA}
\affil{Cambridge University}
\location{Cambridge, UK}
\end{verbatim}

If you have a number of authors with separate affiliations, 
enter a new group of 

\verb+\author \affil \location+  

as you see on the sample page.

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Second AUTHOR}
\affil{Second Affiliation}
\location{Second Location}
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection{Title page and Author title page}

After the above commands are entered, the title page and author title page
commands may be used:

\begin{verbatim}
\titlepage
\authortitlepage
\end{verbatim}

\vtop to0pt{
\verb+\title+, \verb+\author+, \verb+\affil+, and \verb+\location+ 
should all be entered before
using the commands \verb+\titlepage+ and \verb+\authortitlepage+.
\vss}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Table of Contents, List of Figures and List of Tables}
Table of contents, LOF, and LOT are produced the same way with this
package as they are with standard \LaTeX. 

\begin{verbatim}
\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables
\end{verbatim}

List of figures and list of tables are at the author's option.
You may find it necessary to edit the *.lot or *.lof file in 
the following case. If you have a chapter that does not include
any figures or tables, you may want to remove the chapter
call from the .lof or .lot file, i.e.,

\begin{verbatim}
\contentsline {listenv}{{\pbf Chapter\ 3}}{33}
\end{verbatim}
\vskip-12pt
\noindent for instance, if there are no figures found in that 
chapter.

\subsubsection{Preface}
Making the preface is done with \verb+\preface Here is your preface...+.

\newpage
\subsection*{Sample Front Matter}
The beginning of the sample file, booksamp.tex, shows all of these
commands being used. The following example shows the beginning of the file.
You can see the results of these commands in the sample pages, later in
this documentation.

\vtop to0pt{
\code
\begin{verbatim}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% booksamp.tex File
%% for kluwerbk.sty, Kluwer Technical Book style
%% Comments included.

%% You may use either [psfonts] as an optional style file:
%  \documentstyle[psfonts]{kluwerbk}

\documentstyle{kluwerbk}

\begin{document}

%%   You may use \\ to break lines in title, chapter title, and section heads.

%%   \title, \author, \affil, and \location should be entered before
%%    calling for \titlepage and \authortitlepage

\titlepage
\authortitlepage

\tableofcontents
%\listoffigures
%\listoftables

\preface
This is a sample preface.
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vss}


\newpage

\section*{Part, Chapter and Section Heads}
The command for making a part or chapter is not changed from
ordinary \LaTeX\ 

\noindent
\verb+\part{Your Part Title}+.
\verb+\chapter{Your Chapter Title}+.

\noindent
Remember that you may use double backslashes if you want
to specify when a new line starts in the chapter title.

\subsection*{Shortened Version of Chapter Title}
You may need a shortened version of your chapter title so
that it will fit in the running head. This is how to do it:

\verb+\chapter{Here is an Extremely\\ Verbose Chapter Title}+

\verb+\chaptermark{Shortened Title for Running Heads}+

\subsection*{Section Heads}
There is little that needs be said about section heads except
that you can break lines with the double backslash, and
that they should be entered using upper case for the
first letter of important words and lower case for the rest.
Even though the section heads appear in the text with all
caps, the upper and lower case is necessary when the section head
appears in the table of
contents.

\vtop to 0pt{
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\section{This is a Section}
\subsection{This is a Subsection Head}
\subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection Head}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\t
\section{This is a Section}
\subsection{This is a Subsection Head}
\subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection Head}
\endt
\vss}


\newpage
\section*{Itemized List}
The default level of itemized list produces square bullets. Generally
this is the form of list to use in your book.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item
This is a sample list item. This is a sample list item.

\item
Here is the second list item. Here is the second list item.
Here is the second list item. Here is the second list item.
\end{itemize}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\t
\begin{itemize}
\item
This is a sample list item. This is a sample list item.

\item
Here is the second list item. Here is the second list item.
Here is the second list item. Here is the second list item.
\end{itemize}
\endt


\subsubsection{Figure and Table Captions}

With the Kluwer macros, the normal caption is entered as in
standard \LaTeX:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\caption{(Write caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}


However we also have some special use captions.

\noindent
{\bit
For double captions:}


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\dblcaption{(Write caption here.)}{(Write second caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\noindent
{\bit
For continued captions:}


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\contcaption{(Write caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}


Narrow captions are made to be positioned next to the illustration
instead of beneath it.

\noindent
{\bit
For narrow captions:}

\vskip1sp
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\narrowcaption{(Write caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
{\bit
For narrow continued captions:}

\vskip1sp
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\narrowcontcaption{(Write caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}


\noindent
{\bit
To make a figure caption to be turned sideways:}

\vskip1sp
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{widefigure}
\caption{(write caption here.)}
\end{widefigure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Table Captions}

Table captions work the same way, except the table instead
of the figure environment is used, i.e.,


\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
\contcaption{(Write caption here.)}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

If you want more space between the table caption and the table
you can set the dimensions: \verb+\abovetableskip=<dimen>+ and
\verb+\belowtableskip=<dimen>+.

There is also a command to make a table caption that
is intended to be printed sideways on the page:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{widetable}
\caption{(write caption here.)}
\end{widetable}
\end{verbatim}
\newpage
\subsection*{Lettered figure and table captions}
The Kluwer macros give you the opportunity to use a letter with
your caption number. The resulting number/letter combination can
be cross-referenced. The new command to use is\newline
\verb+\letteredcapion{<letter>}{<caption>}+.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1a}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1b}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\label{normalfig}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\specialt
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\end{figure}
\endspecialt


\newpage

And, of course, this works just the same for table captions:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcr}\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table1a}
\end{table}
\noindent Showing references: first lettered table is \ref{table1a}, first 
lettered figure is \ref{figure1a}, second lettered figure is \ref{figure1b}.
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\specialt
\vskip-24pt
\textwidth=6.5in
\hsize=6.5in
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}\noindent
Showing references: first lettered table is 1.1a, first 
lettered figure is 1.1a, second lettered figure is 1.1b.
\endspecialt

The command \verb+\lettereddblcaption{<letter>}{<caption>}
{<letter>}{<caption>}+ will allow you to use letters for
a double figure or table caption:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\lettereddblcaption{a}{(Write caption here.)}
{b}{(Write second caption here.)}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\vtop to0pt{
\results
\makeatletter
\def\@captype{figure}
\lettereddblcaption{a}{(Write caption here.)}{b}{(Write second caption here.)}
\makeatother
\endresults
\vss}



\newpage
\section*{Making Lettered Equations}
Equations are made as they normally are in \LaTeX, with the
exception that in the Kluwer book style you have the option
of lettered equations, as demonstrated here.
You can use the command
\verb+\mathletter{<letter>}+ to determine the letter. 
The equation counter will advance only the
first time that \verb+mathletter{<letter>}+ is used until
the next equation that is unlettered.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Lettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}
\end{equation}

Second lettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}
\end{equation}

Unlettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\vtop to 0pt{
\results
Lettered equation,
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}
\end{equation}

Second lettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}
\end{equation}

Unlettered equation
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}
\endresults
\vss}
\newpage

To use letters with eqnarray:


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Formally, this amounts to calculating:
\begin{eqnarray}
g_i(y|f)&=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{a}\\
g_2(y|f)&=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{b}\\
g_3(y|f)&=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)\mathletter{c}\\
g_4(y|f)&=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{eqnarray}
where $g_i(y|F_n)$ is the function specifying...
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results
Formally, this amounts to calculating:
\begin{eqnarray}

\endresults


\newpage
\section*{Macros for Programming Examples}

\subsection*{Boxed code examples}

\verb+\begin{codebox}{(width of box)}...\end{codebox}+
are used to call attention to a particular piece of 
programming code.

Lines will be preserved as you see them
on the screen, as will spaces at the beginning of the line.
To produce printed `{\tt\string{}' 
brackets, precede them with {\tt\string\string}.

You may use codebox in a figure, as in the following example:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{codebox}{\textwidth}
DO*(j=(l+1), p)\string{
          float t; int i;
          t=0.0
              DO(i=1, n)\string{
                  t=t+col[i]
\string}
\end{codebox}
\caption{This is an example of some programming code.}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\specialt
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{codebox}{\textwidth}
DO*(j=(l+1), p)\string{
          float t; int i;
          t=0.0
              DO(i=1, n)\string{
                  t=t+col[i]
\string}
\end{codebox}
\caption{This is an example of some programming code.}
\end{figure}
\endspecialt


\newpage
\subsubsection{Unboxed code sample}

The command \verb+\begin{codesamp}...+ \verb+\end{codesamp}+
are used
when you want to demonstrate some programming code, unboxed.
As with codebox, 
lines will be preserved as you see them
on the screen, as will spaces at the beginning of the line, and
to produce printed `{\tt\string{}' 
brackets, precede them with {\tt\string\string}.

\verb+\begin{codebox}...\end{codebox}+ can be inserted within

\subsubsection{To Illustrate an Algorithm}

This is the command to use when you want to illustrate an algorithm
with some pseudo code. A backslash followed with a space will
indent the line. Every line will be printed
as it is seen on the screen. Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

Remember
\verb+\bit+ will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
boldface in Computer Modern.

\subsection*{References}
References may be made with or without Bibtex. This section will
demonstrate how to make references without Bibtex; the following
section will describe the steps needed to make a bibliography with
BibTeX.

The reference section can be made with the commands

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{references}
....
\end{references}
\end{verbatim}

Each reference item starts 
with the command \verb+\bibitem+ followed by a term surrounded
by curly brackets which is used for cross-referencing the 
bibliographic entry. The number of the bibliographic
entry will be printed when the term is used with \verb+\cite+:
\verb+\cite{jacobs}+, for example. (The file must be \LaTeX ed
twice for this to work. The first time the file is processed,
\verb+\cite{label}+ will produce `[?]'.)

\subsection*{Using BibTeX}
The Kluwer style does allow the use of BibTeX.

BibTeX is a separate program which can be used with LaTeX to
produce a database file and build a bibliography. Its use is described
in the LaTeX book, p. 74--75, and p.~140--147.  
If you have never used Bibtex before,
you might consider doing so. The major advantages to using BibTeX are
that you can build a database of your references
that you can reuse for other books or articles, and
you can choose from a number of bibliographic styles.

To use BibTeX follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Make a xxx.bib file, with `xxx' being any file name you choose. 
This is the database file
including all the references. The form that these entries should take
is described in the LaTeX book.

\item
In your .tex file enter \verb+\bibliographystyle{(style)}+. Your choices
of bibliography style are:{\tt plain, unsrt, alpha, abbrv}. The styles
are described on p.~74 of the LaTeX book.

Next you must write \verb+\bibliography{xxx}+, with `xxx' being the name of 
the .bib database file that you have written. You can also use more
than one .bib file, in which case you must separate the filenames with
a comma: \verb+\bibliography{xxx,yyy}+.

\item
Run Latex on the .tex document, producing the usual .aux file. When you
look at the .aux file you will see that it now contains
\verb+\bibstyle{(style)}+ and \verb+\bibdata{xxx}+.

\item
Run BibTex on the .tex document, producing  a .bbl file, 

\item
And, finally, run LaTeX on the .tex file, and Voila! there is your
bibliography, neatly done in the style you have chosen. The citations
in the text will also take the form you have chosen when you named
the bibliography style.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

Here is an example:

First we make a file called sample.bib which contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
@BOOK	(samp:key,
	AUTHOR = "Strunk, Jr., William and E. B. White",
	TITLE= "The Elements of Style",
	PUBLISHER = "Macmillan",
	EDITION = "Third",
	YEAR = 1979,
	ADDRESS = "New York")

@BOOK	(second:thing,
	AUTHOR = "Calvin Coolidge",
	TITLE= "The Cats of Maine",
	PUBLISHER = "Silly Press",
	YEAR = 1984,
	ADDRESS = "Chatham, Maine, USA")
\end{verbatim}

Then, in our .tex file we enter citations and the two
bibliography commands:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Here are citations, \cite{samp:key}, \cite{second:thing}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{sample}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

Next, we run LaTeX on the .tex file. When we look at the .aux
file we have just produced, we see that it now contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
\bibstyle{plain}
\bibdata{sample}
...
\end{verbatim}


Then  we run BibTeX on the same .tex file to
produce the .bbl file. You can look at, and edit the .bbl file
if you'd like.


\newpage
Finally, we re-LaTeX our .tex file and produce these results:

{ \linewidth=28.5pc
\t

Here are citations, [2], [1].

\begin{thebibliography}{1}

\vskip1sp
\vskip-24pt

\newblock {\it The Elements of Style}.
\newblock Macmillan,

If we were to use \verb+\bibliographystyle{alpha}+, we would
get these results:

\chapter*{Making Your Index}
\vskip20pt


There are four steps needed to make an index: 

\begin{itemize}
\item
Marking the words to
be indexed in the text, 

\item
Running \LaTeX\ on the file,
 
\item
Sorting the {\tt.inx} file, and

\item
Printing the formatted index.
\end{itemize}



Each step will be explained
briefly here, and in more detail in the following sections.

\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\section*{Marking the text}
There are two kinds of index entries in the text:

\vskip-\parskip
\btt{inx\lc{\tt word or words}\rc}, and 

\vskip-\parskip
\btt{inxx\lc{\tt word or words}\rc}.


The first form will print the term between curly brackets
on the page and will also send it to an {\tt.inx} file
along with the current page number.

The second, called a `silent' entry, will not print on the page but will send
the material between curly brackets to the {\tt.inx}
file along with the current page number.

\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\begin{description}
\item[CAREFUL:]
Do not leave an empty space between the silent index entry
and the word preceding it. An extra space will appear in your text
if there is a space both before and after the \btt{inxx} command.
Your input should look like this: 

{\tt\dots 
some words\btt{inxx\lc index entry\rc \dots}}\vskip-\parskip\noindent
Not\vskip-\parskip\noindent
{\tt\dots 
some words \btt{inxx\lc index entry\rc \dots}}

Remember that starting a new line in your editor will also generate
an empty space, so do not do this either:

{\tt\dots 
some words\vskip-\parskip\noindent
\btt{inxx\lc index entry\rc \dots}}
\end{description}


\newpage
\subsection*{Subheadings in the Index}
To form an index entry as a subheading of another 
index entry, repeat the first entry and
follow it with the new entry.

For example:

After you have typed
\btt{inx\lc trees\rc} or \btt{inxx\lc trees\rc},

you may type
\btt{inxx\lc trees,green\rc} to cause `green' and
its associated page number to be placed in the index
under the entry for `trees.' 


A third level of subheading is
produced in the same way: 
\vskip-\parskip
\noindent
\btt{inxx\lc trees,green,pointy\rc}.
This will format `pointy' underneath the entry for `green'.

\section*{\LaTeX ing the file}
When you \LaTeX\ {\tt filename.tex}  containing the
marked entries you will automatically produce
a {\tt filename.inx}.  

\section*{Sorting the {\tt.inx} file}
You can sort the {\tt filename.inx} file
with a sorting routine on your system.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
The MS-DOS command is {\tt sort $<$ filename.inx $>$ filename.srt}.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
The Vax VMS command is {\tt sort filename.inx filename.srt}.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
The UNIX command is {\tt sort -f filename.inx > filename.srt}.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
Apparently there is no sort routine as part of the Macintosh
software but there are public domain Macintosh sorting packages available.

\section*{Marking the {\tt.srt} file}
If you want to make additions to the index entries
such as ``See Also Douglas Firs'' or
to change the fonts of certain entries or
to add a large letter and a ruled line before
each new alphabetical group, you can do this in {\tt filename.srt}.
However, you do not need to even look at this file if you
do not wish to make changes to the index.

For more information see ``Making typeface changes to index entries'' and
``Adding material to your sorted file'' below.

\section*{Printing the Index}
The command: \btt{printindex} will print the index.
This command will input the {\tt filename.srt} file
to generate your index,
formed in double columns, with a dash between sequential page numbers
and with subsidiary entries formatted below their major entry.

More information on each step follows. 
%\newpage


\section*{Entering words to be indexed in the text}
As described earlier, entries are to be marked either

\btt{inx\lc (entry)\rc} 

or

\btt{inxx\lc (entry)\rc} 

\begin{description}
\item[CAREFUL:]When you mark an index entry with \btt{inx} the
word or words will print in the text as well as in the auxiliary file.

However, don't try to use this method of marking a word or phrase if it
is in the argument of another macro.  

To index a word or words that are inside a
macro argument, use the second
method: rewrite the word or words outside the macro and precede
it with \btt{inxx}.
If in doubt follow the second method
which may be slightly more effort, but whose results will be more predictable.
\end{description}

\subsection*{To call attention to a particular pagenumbers in the index:} 
You may
mark index entries with one or two asterisks.

\btt{inx\lc index entry$\ast$\rc} or \btt{inxx\lc index entry$\ast$\rc} 
will cause the page number to be
underlined.

\btt{inx\lc index entry$\ast\ast$\rc} or \btt{inxx\lc index entry$\ast\ast$\rc} 
will cause the page number to 
appear in boldface.  You may want to use this as a method of
calling attention to the definition of a term (underlined) or
an example of the term in use (boldface).

\newpage
\subsection*{Examples of first, second or third level index entries} 
As mentioned above, second
level entries are produced by writing the primary term,
then a comma, then
the word you are indexing. For example, index entries written on a page 33:

{\obeylines\parskip=0pt
\btt{inx\lc First Level\rc} (or \btt{inxx\lc First Level\rc})
\btt{inxx\lc First Level,Second Level\rc}
will yield the index entries
\hskip2pc First Level, 33
\hskip3pc Second Level, 33
with the page numbers produced automatically. 

\vskip6pt
The third level is produced similarly:
\btt{inx\lc First Level\rc} (or \btt{inx\lc First Level\rc})
\btt{inxx\lc First Level,Second Level\rc}
\btt{inxx\lc First Level,Second Level,Third Level\rc}

Results in:
\hskip2pc First Level, 33
\hskip3pc Second Level, 33
\hskip4pc Third Level, 101}

%\newpage

\begin{description}
\item{\bf CAREFUL:}

\item{\bf Spaces:}
Notice that there
are no spaces after the comma in the index entry.
It is important to keep spaces from appearing between
entry levels for the index
formatter to work correctly.

\item{\bf Consistency:}
Capital and small letters will not be distinguished by the index
formatter but will be sorted differently. Therefore you must be
careful to be consistent in capitalization.  

\item{\bf Commas:}
Since commas are used to separate arguments in the index
entries, you must write \btt{,} when you actually want a comma
to appear in the formatted index. For example:

\btt{inxx\lc Nixon\btt, Richard Milhous\rc}

will print in the index as:

\hskip2pc Nixon, Richard Milhous, 72

If you forgot to put the backslash in front of the comma after
`Nixon' as in the following:

\btt{inxx\lc Nixon, Richard Milhous\rc}

The results will be

{}\hskip2pc Nixon
\vskip-\parskip
{}\hskip3pc Richard Milhous, 72
\end{description}

\newpage
\subsection*{How to make a first or second level entry {\it Without}
page numbers} 
You may occassionally want to have a major or secondary index entry
that doesn't have a page number associated with it, but is used
as a heading for the following entries. 

To do this, type the second or third level entries
as you would do ordinarily, but do not
make an index entry for the first level term by itself.  

For example, if these \btt{inxx} entries have been used in the text:
{\obeylines\parskip=0pt
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Holstein-Friesen\rc}
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Jersey\rc}
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Holy\rc}

The index will look like this:
\hskip2pc Cows
\hskip3pc Holstein-Friesen, 33
\hskip3pc Jersey, 43
\hskip3pc Holy, 23

}


The same sequence follows for second and third level entries; when
the third level is being looked at by the index formatter it will
check to see if the second level has been printed. If it hasn't
the formatter will supply the second level entry without a page number.

%\newpage
The second level without a page number is produced like this:
{\obeylines\parskip=0pt
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Four-legged,black and white\rc}
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Four-legged,gentle brown\rc}
\btt{inxx\lc Cows,Four-legged,invisible\rc}
\vskip12pt
Results in:
\hskip2pc Cows
\hskip3pc Four-legged
\hskip4pc black and white, 101
\hskip4pc gentle brown, 201
\hskip4pc invisible, 32

}




\subsection*{Index Error Control}
You might have inadvertantly neglected to supply a first level
entry and asked for second or third level entries that were to
appear under the first level entry.  In this case the index formatter
will supply the first level entry without a page number, just as
if that was your intention. Similarly, if third level entries
have been called for without the preceding second level entry
ever being asked for by itself, the second level entry will print
without a page number, as if that was your intention.

\vtop to0pt{
Thus, you have a method of index error control, that will let
you know if you neglected to enter a term with \btt{inxx} that
you intended. Scan your completed index to see if there are
entries without page numbers. If this was not your intention, either
edit your original file to supply the appropriate \btt{inxx} term,
or edit the .srt file to supply the term and page number.
\vss}
\newpage

\section*{OK, the index entries are marked, now what?}

The first thing to do is \LaTeX\ the file that contains the marked index
entries.

You will automatically produce an auxilary file named {\tt filename.inx}
with `filename' being the name of the file you \LaTeX ed and the
{\tt.inx} extension being added automatically.


\subsection*{How to sort the {\tt.inx} file}
The next step is to sort the contents of the file.
On a VAX running VMS, you do this by typing\vskip-\parskip\noindent
{\tt sort filename.inx filename.srt}.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
The UNIX command is {\tt sort -f filename.inx > filename.srt}.
\vskip-\parskip\noindent
The MS-DOS command is {\tt sort <filename.inx > filename.srt}.
\vskip-\parskip\noindent
If you are using another system, you must find the sorting
command for that system.

\subsection*{Looking at the {\tt.srt} file}
You can look at the sorted file in your editor. Notice that the
page numbers that are less than 10 will be preceded with two zeros,
and those that are more than 10 but less than 100 will be preceded
with one zero.   These
`leading zeros' will not print but are necessary for the sort algorithm to
work correctly. 

\subsection*{Special use characters: $>$\ and \~{}}
There is a `$>$' at the top of the {\tt.srt} file and 
a `\~{}' at the end of the file. These are commands to make the
index formatter work correctly. $>$ must immediately precede the index entries
and \~{} must immediately follow them, so do not change their position.

You can use \~{}\ as you would normally, except you {\bf may not}
use \~{}\ at the beginning of an index entry (and I can think of
no reason that you would want to) except as an accent (\btt{\~{} ...}).

\section*{Making changes in the {\tt.srt} file}You can make
typeface changes, add or delete index entries, add comments
to the index with the \btt{addtoindex} command, and separate
the index into alphabetical sections with the use of the \btt{ltr}
command.  However, remember: These changes will disappear
the next time you sort the {.inx} file to produce
a new {\tt.srt} file.

\subsection*{Making typeface changes to index entries}
If you want to change the typeface of an index entry, you can do
this in your sorted file with these commands:

\begin{verbatim}
\indexit{index entry} |1{003}  
\indexbf{index entry} |1{003}  
\indextt{index entry} |1{003}  
\indexsl{index entry} |1{003}  
\end{verbatim}

As you may have guessed, \btt{indexit} will produce {\it italics},
\btt{indexbf} will produce {\bf bold face},
\btt{indextt} will produce {\tt typewriter font},
and
\btt{indexsl} will produce {\sl slanted typeface}.

Assuming that you will be using this command on first level
index entries, each of these commands will cause the first
letter to be capitalized. If you want the first letter to
be lower-case use this form:

\begin{verbatim}
\lcindexit{index entry} |1{003}  
\lcindexbf{index entry} |1{003}  
\lcindextt{index entry} |1{003}  
\lcindexsl{index entry} |1{003}  
\end{verbatim}

If you change the typeface on any index entry, remember
to do the same thing for every entry of the term on the
same level.
The reason that this is important is that the index formatter
will not recognize two entries as being the same
if one is `\btt{indexbf\lc index entry\rc}'

and the next is `{\tt index entry}'. If the formatter sees
the entries as different, the second entry would print on its own line.


\subsection*{Using \btt{addtoindex}}
If you want to add a comment to your index
you can enter the commands \btt{addtoindex...}\btt{endadd}.
These commands will temporarily interrupt the index formatter
and allow you to enter text or extra vertical space at
any point in the index. See examples of this in `Indexing Examples' following.

If you want a horizontal line or lines to appear, write
\btt{hrule}. You will probably want to include extra vertical space if
you use \btt{hrule}s since there is no interline space added by default
for hrules.  

\vtop to0pt{
You must end \btt{addtoindex} with \btt{endadd}.  Here is a complete
example;

\begin{verbatim}
Grass |1{001}
\addtoindex
\vskip10pt
See also, Blue-green grass.
\vskip10pt
\endadd
\end{verbatim}
\vss}
\newpage

\subsection*{Making a page range to use with ff}
If you want to direct your reader to a page range
in which he/she will find information on a particular topic,
you can use \btt{addtoindex}:

\begin{verbatim}
\addtoindex
Grass, 51--65 {\it ff}
\endadd
\end{verbatim}

or

\begin{verbatim}
\addtoindex
See also, Grass, 51--65 {\it ff}
\endadd
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Separating index into alphabetical sections}
The command \btt{ltr\lc Letter \rc} makes it
easy to format the index into separate alphabetical areas.
Before the first entry for each new letter, use\vskip-\parskip\noindent
\btt{addtoindex}, \btt{ltr\lc Letter\rc}, \btt{endadd}.\vskip-\parskip\noindent
For instance, before the B's:\vskip-\parskip\noindent

\begin{verbatim}
\addtoindex
\ltr{B}
\endadd
\end{verbatim}

Compare the code in the example at the end of this section
with the resulting index to see this macro at work.

\subsection*{Other editing changes in the {\tt .srt} file}
You can also edit the {\tt.srt} file in other ways, if you'd like.  You can
add or delete entries, or change the page number to appear underlined
or bold by adding \btt{global}\btt{spcount =1} or 
\btt{global}\btt{spcount =2} within 
the curly brackets that surround the page number.

\newpage
\section*{Formatting the Index}
Once you have made any desired changes to your {\tt.srt} file you
can format the index in the originating file by writing this
command where you want the index to appear:

\begin{verbatim}
\printindex
\end{verbatim}


\section*{Changing the Format of the Index}

\subsection*{Automatic Capitalization of the First Letter}
Your index will be formatted automatically with the first letter
of each first level index term being capitalized. 
The second and third level
index terms will not print in uppercase unless they were typed that way 
with the \btt{inxx} command.
If for
any reason you do not like this, you can read the instructions
at the end of the macro file where you see this:

\begin{verbatim}
%% CHANGE INDEX FORMAT HERE ====>

%% If you DO NOT want the first letter of each first level index
%% entry to be capitalized, delete the % in front of the following line, 
%% and put % in front of the next line:

%\let\capthis\relax
\def\capthis#1{\uppercase{#1}}%

\indexindent=8pt %% indentation for index subentries
\indexwrap=24pt  %% indentation when term is too wide for column,
                 %% continues on following lines indented this much.
\end{verbatim}

These commands can be changed to meet your requirements.

\section*{Indexing Examples}

\subsection*{Sample of text marked for indexing}

\begin{verbatim}
Here is \inx{Edward Bear*}, coming downstairs, bump, bump,bump,
on the back of his head, behind \inx{Christopher Robin}.  It is, 
as far as he knows, the only way of \inx{coming downstairs}, but 
sometimes he feels\inxx{coming downstairs,bumping}\inxx{coming 
downstairs,stop bumping} that there really is another way, if 
only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. 

\newpage
And then he feels that perhaps there isn't.  Anyhow, here he is 
at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you\inxx{coming 
downstairs,stop bumping,at the bottom}. \inx{Winnie-the-Pooh**}.

\newpage
\section*{One Day}
One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the 
middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a 
large \inx{oak-tree}, and, from the top of the tree, there came a 
loud buzzing-noise.\inxx{oak-tree,large}\inxx{oak-tree,large,top}
\inxx{buzzing}\inxx{buzzing-noise}

\newpage
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head 
between his paws and began to think.\inxx{oak-tree,large,foot}
\inxx{trees,oak}\inxx{trees,maple}\inxx{trees,pine}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Sample {.inx} file}
When \TeX\ is run on the preceding text an {\tt.inx} file will be made.
It will look like this:

\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\begin{verbatim}
>
~
Edward Bear |{001\global \spcount =1}
Christopher Robin |{001}
coming downstairs |{001}
coming downstairs,bumping |{001}
coming downstairs,stop bumping |{001}
coming downstairs,stop bumping,at the bottom |{002}
Winnie-the-Pooh |{002\global \spcount =2}
oak-tree |{003}
oak-tree,large |{003}
oak-tree,large,top |{003}
...
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
\subsection*{Sample {.srt} file}
The {\tt.inx} file must be sorted to produce a {.srt} file.
That file will look like the following example. Notice
the leading zeros which are needed for the sorting algorithm
to work correctly. 

\begin{verbatim}
>
buzzing |{003}
buzzing-noise |{003}
coming downstairs |{001}
coming downstairs,bumping |{001}
coming downstairs,stop bumping |{001}
coming downstairs,stop bumping,at the bottom |{002}
Christopher Robin |{001}
Edward Bear |{001\global\spcount =1}
oak-tree |{003}
oak-tree,large |{003}
oak-tree,large,foot |{004}
oak-tree,large,top |{003}
...
~
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Sample formatted index}
The command \btt{printindex} will cause the {.srt} file to be
input into the original file.
Notice  `trees'  which was never
a first level entry, but is used as the first part of several second
level entries, and so is formatted as an entry without a page number.  
The index will be formatted and look like this:


\vtop to0pt{
\parskip=0pt
\hsize=.4\hsize
\beginindex
buzzing |{003}
buzzing-noise |{003}
coming downstairs |{001}

\endadd

\vskip1sp

\newpage
\section*{Making changes or additions to the 
{\tt.srt} file}

Here is the same .srt file with some comments added
with \btt{addtoindex}, and Winnie-the-Pooh changed to boldface:

\begin{verbatim}

\endadd

trees,oak |{004}
trees,pine |{004}
\indexbf{Winnie-the-Pooh} |{002\global\spcount =2}

\end{verbatim}


Which will produce the index on the following page:
\newpage

the commands to use. Lines will be preserved as you see them
on the screen, as will spaces at the beginning of the line.

% Notice that \begin{codebox}...\end{codebox} can be inserted within
%   codesamp, and will be positioned at the same distance from right
%   margin as text. codebox needs an argument for the width of the box,
