\chapter{Using the Kluwer Large Journal Macros}

\noindent
Welcome to the use of the Kluwer \LaTeX\ macro package for the 
production of articles to be published in large size Kluwer Journals.
You will find that most of the
commands found in the \LaTeX\ book will work exactly the same with
the use of this package. The few new commands, or commands that
are used somewhat differently will be shown here, followed
by a set of sample pages. The sample pages will be interspersed
with pages of the \LaTeX\ code that produced them, so 
that by comparing the code with the results
you can quite quickly see how to use the commands needed to
format your article.

If you find that you are having a problem {\bf after you have read
this documentation carefully}, help may be had by sending email
to Suzanne Rumsey at {\tt prod@world.std.com}. If possible, please
send a small file demonstrating the problem.

These are the topics to be covered:

\begin{itemize}
\item
The template and sample file\qquad{\it 2}

\item
Starting your article\qquad{\it 3}

\item
Section heads\qquad{\it 6}

\item

\subsection{The Template File}
A template file, lgjtmpl.tex is provided to make it
easier to enter the correct commands in the correct order.
It should be self-explanatory. After the \verb+\end{document}+
you will see a list of other commands that you might want
to use in the process of typesetting your article.

You are strongly urged to use this file!

\subsection{The Sample File}
The sample file, {\tt lgjsamp.tex}, may help you see how to
use the commands. All of the parts of the sample file will
be shown in this documentation, but some people find
it easier to understand how to use commands when they
actually see them in use in an on-line file.

\subsection{Using the Large Format Journal Style}

Please start by copying the template file, {\tt lgjtmpl.tex}, and
renaming it. (i.e., in DOS:\newline
{\tt copy lgtmpl.tex jourart.tex}).
You will see that the beginning of your article file will
look like this:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
%% Large Size Journal Article Template

\section{Starting Your Article}

You don't have to enter anything until you see this comment:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
%%==================================================================
%%  Authors, start here ==>>
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

Your article will start with the title, author name or names,
and other title information:

\vskip-12pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
%%  Authors, start here ==>>

%% May use \\ to start a new line in title
\title{}

\author{}

% Optional: use \email{} for email address, i.e., \email{garcia@cata.spn.edu}

%% Repeat \author{}\email{}\affil{}
%% for as many authors with separate affiliations as needed.
%% You may also use 
%    \authors{author one, author two, etc.}
%    \email{one email address 
%             or a number of email addresses separated by commas}
%    \affil{same affil.}

%% You may use \\ to start a new line in a group of authors.
%% To acknowledge funding, etc, you may use the \thanks{} command, i.e.,
%%

\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\newpage
These commands are self-explanatory with the following exceptions:


\begin{itemize}
\item
You can a new line in the title or affiliation with `\verb+\\+'

\item
You can use as many separate author names and affiliations as
you need.


\item
You can use multiple author names and with a single affiliation.

\item
You can use the \LaTeX\ command \verb+\thanks{}+ to acknowledge
funding sources.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
During the last ten years, a lot of attention has been paid to the
problem of automatic design of {\it Systolic Algorithms} (SAs)
[1]-[5]. A method for automatic design takes a specification of the
SA.  Since the final objective is to implement the SA in hardware,
aspects such as limitations in the number of PEs, fault aspects such
as limitations should be taken into account in the design procedure.
Within this context, this paper proposes a method to transform SAs for
efficient implementation using {\it Pipelined Functional Units} (PFUs).

\section{Two Column Format}
The two column format will start with the command 
\verb+\begin{article}+. Normally you will not have
to be aware of this as you build your article. There
are some cases, however, in which you may want to
use figures, tables, or algorithm examples that are
wider than the width of a single column. Also you may
have some particular type of text, such as an extended
example of an user interface or  computer code, in which
you might like to abandon the two column format temporarily,
and then return to it after the example is over.

The commands
\verb+\spanbothcolumns...\endspanbothcolumns+
will allow you to temporarily stop the two column format.
You can use this to have full page wide figures or tables.
They can be sent to the top or bottom of the page by
following \verb+\begin{figure}+  or \verb+\begin{table}+ with
a letter in square brackets to indicate the place where you want the
figure to print. As with normal \LaTeX\ syntax,
the figures in the \verb+\spanbothcolumns+ environment
will be sent to the top ({\tt[t]}) or bottom of the page
({\tt[b]}), or be printed on their own page ({\tt[p]}).

Here is an example figure spanning both columns at the top of the page:
\vskip-12pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns
\begin{figure}[t]
...
\caption{(optional caption)}
\end{figure}
\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-12pt

Send figure to span both columns at the bottom of the page:
\vskip-12pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns
\begin{figure}[b]
...
\caption{(optional caption)}
\end{figure}
\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-12pt

Send figure to span both columns on its own page:
\vskip-12pt
\vtop to0pt{
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns
\begin{figure}[p]
...
\caption{(optional caption)}
\end{figure}
\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode\vss}

\newpage

You can look at the sample pages to see examples of figures and tables in 
different positions on the page.


You may have occassion to span both columns in the
middle of a page. In that case, follow
\verb+\spanbothcolumns+ with {\tt[h]}.
\newline
\verb+\spanbothcolumns[h]...\endspanbothcolumns+

\vskip-6pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns[h]

Algorithm, or any other text
that needs more width than a single column.

\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

It is not a good idea to position a figure or table in the
middle of text, since visually they would be more effective floated
to the top or bottom of the page. If you have some compelling
reason to do this, however, you may write:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns[h]
\begin{figure}
\vspace*{1in}
\caption{ }
\end{figure}
\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-6pt

The same sequence of commands can be used for tables as for figures, just
substitute `table' for `figure' in the examples above, i.e.,
to send table to span both columns at the top of the page: 

\vskip-6pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\spanbothcolumns
\begin{table}[t]
...
\caption{(optional caption)}
\end{figure}
\endspanbothcolumns
\end{verbatim}
\endcode


\newpage
\subsection{Temporarily ending two column format}
If you have an extended example of programming code
or some other text which is too wide for a single
column, you may return to single column format by
entering the command:\newline
\verb+\endtwocolumns+.

You may return to the two column format when
your example is finished by writing\newline
\verb+\twocolumns+.

You will see an example of the need to abandon double
column format temporarily in the sample pages where
there is an extended example of an user interface.

\subsection{Bad column and page makeup}
If your article is complicated from a typesetting standpoint,
that is, uses a large number of figures or tables or goes
from two column format back to one column, there may be
pages that aren't made up as elegantly as we might like. 
That is, there may be excessive space between lines, above
sections or between paragraphs. This is the result of \TeX\
making its best calculations as to what we want but not being
able to satisfy all our demands simultaneously, i.e., not to
have `widow' or `club' lines, keep section headings with the
text immediately following them, etc. If you see that some part
of your article is not being made up correctly, there are
some commands that might be helpful:

\verb+\goodbreak+ will encourage \TeX\ to start a new right hand
column if it is used at the end of the left hand column.

\verb+\newpage+ will start a new page and can be used to end
the lefthand column. It will fill the bottom of the column
with space however.

\verb+\eject+ will start a new page and can be used to end
the lefthand column, it will not supply any extra vertical space.

You may notice examples of these commands being used in the
sample pages, and in {\tt samp.tex}.

Using \verb+\begin{figure}[h]+ is more likely to cause
trouble then \verb+\begin{figure}[t]+ or
\verb+\begin{figure}[b]+, so this is another command that
you might want to change if the columns are not being made
up as you'd like.

As the author, however, you don't need to worry about any of
the fine points of page makeup, as the final version of the
article will be produced at Kluwers anyway, and may introduce
font changes, or changes in the sizes left for illustrations.


\newpage
\section{Figures and Table Captions}
As seen in the last section, figures and figure captions can 
span both columns. Figure captions can also be used within a single
column. The syntax is the same as used for standard \LaTeX\ figures;
the letters following the \verb+\begin{figure}+ (or \verb+\begin{table}+)
will send figure or table to top of column, {\tt[t]};
bottom of the column, {\tt[b]}; where found in text, {\tt[h]},
on its own page, {\tt[p]}. There is an
exception in that if there are multiple letters following 
\verb+\begin{figure}+ i.e.,
\verb+\begin{figure}[htb]+, 
only the first letter will be  used.

Leave enough space for the figure to be added with \verb+\vspace*{<dimen>}+.

\vskip-24pt
\vskip1sp
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[t]
\vspace*{1in}
\caption{ }
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-24pt
\vskip-1sp
\subsection{Lettered figure and table captions}
The Kluwer macros give you the opportunity to use a letter with
your caption number. The resulting number/letter combination can
be cross-referenced. The new command to use is
\verb+\letteredcapion{<letter>}{<caption>}+.

\vskip-24pt
\vskip-1sp
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1a}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\label{figure1b}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\label{normalfig}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-24pt
\vtop to0pt{\vskip-24pt
\vskip1sp
\results
\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\letteredcaption{b}{Lettered figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Normal figure caption.}
\end{figure}
\endresults
\vss}
\newpage

And, of course, this works just the same for table captions:
\vskip-12pt
\vskip1sp
\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table1a}
\end{table}
\noindent Showing references: first lettered table is \ref{table1a}, first 
lettered figure is \ref{figure1a}, second lettered figure is \ref{figure1b}.
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-30pt
\vskip-1sp

\results
\begin{table}[h]
\letteredcaption{a}{A short table caption.}
\begin{tabular}{lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}\noindent
Showing references: first lettered table is 1a, first 
lettered figure is 1a, second lettered figure is 1b.
\endresults
\vskip-36pt
\vskip1sp

\subsection{Positioning figures}
You must be a bit careful about positioning your figures
or you might find that the figure numbering will not be
correct. For instance, you might use \verb+\begin{figure}[p]+
followed by \verb+\begin{figure}[b]+. The figure to
be placed at the bottom of the page will print first, the
one on its own page will print second. However, the numbering
of the captions will be set at the point where TeX encountered
them in the text, so the first encountered will have the lower
number. This means the caption which is on its own page will
have a lower caption number than the one preceding it. 

Another way the numbering can go wrong is if you have
called for \verb+\begin{figure}[b]+ thinking it would end
up on the previous page, and then \verb+\begin{figure}[t]+ .
If these ended up being in the same column, the lower numbered
caption would be at the bottom of the column, with the higher
number at the top.

After you have finished your article, please scan it to 
check that the captions are numbered correctly. If they
are not, you should move the figures or change their positions
until the numbering is correct. This same caution should
be made for tables; you may also need to reposition tables
on the page, or change their position key; {\tt[t]}, {\tt[b]}, 
{\tt[h]}, or {\tt[p]}.


\newpage
\section{Making Tables}
In order to make your table conform to the Kluwer Journal
specification you must follow several steps.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Use caption on top of the table. 

\item
Use \verb+\hline+ at the top of the table, underneath the column headers
and at the end of the table.

\item
You are discouraged from using vertical lines in tables, but
it you must include vertical lines, you must also use 
\verb+\savehline+ instead of \verb+\hline+ or there will be a
gap between the vertical and horizontal lines.
(\verb+\hline+ has been redefined to add some vertical space above and
below it.)

\item
Try to make your table span the full column or page width.
\end{itemize}

The following example shows these steps being followed and the
form of the table preamble that will cause the table
to spread out to the width of the column:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is an example table caption.}
\begin{tabular*}{\hsize}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcr}
\hline
$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\spresults
\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This is an example table caption.}
\begin{tabular*}{\hsize}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lcr}

$\alpha\beta\Gamma\Delta$ One&Two&Three\cr
\hline
one&two&three\cr
one&two&three\cr
\hline
\end{tabular*}
\end{table}
\endspresults

The caption will center if it is only a few words, and
form a paragraph if there is more text.
Please see the sample pages for more table examples.

\section{Making Equations}
Equations are made as they normally are in \LaTeX.
The Kluwer large journal style will place the equation 36 points
indented from the left margin:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Text above the displayed math.
Text above the displayed math.
Text above the displayed math.
\[
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)f_j(y|x^2)

\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\]
\endresults

If you have an equation that needs the full width of the
column to fit, use the command \verb+\begin{wideequation}+:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
Text above the displayed math.
Text above the displayed math.
Text above the displayed math.
\begin{wideequation}
\[
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)f_j(y|x^2)abcabc

\end{wideequation}
\endresults

\newpage
To split display math into two lines, you can use the\newline
\verb+\begin{splitmath}...\end{splitmath}+\newline commands.
The top line will move to the left, and the bottom line
to the right. \verb+\\+ shows where to break the lines.

Or, if you want a numbered equation:

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\begin{splitmath}

\end{splitmath}
\end{equation}
\endresults

\subsection{Lettered Equations}
You may want to letter some equations,  keeping the equation
numbers from advancing. You can do this with the command
\verb+\mathletter{<letter>}+:

\code
\begin{verbatim}

\subsection{Theorem Type Environments}
The command \verb+\begin{proclaim}{}+ can be used
for a number of similar kinds of statements. The
following example shows it used for a theorem, but
it can also be used for Corollary, Lemma, Proposition, Demonstration, etc. 

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proclaim}{Theorem 1}LEA-MONOTONE-K-CNF makes at most
$(n+1)^K$ mistakes on any monotone K-CNF formula. (Recall that
n is the size of the largest example seen...

\endresults

The proof environment has only one peculiarity: if
the proof ends with an equation you must end
the equation with the command \verb+\inmathqed+ to
make the qed box position correctly. The following two
examples show a proof, and then a proof using 
\verb+\inmathqed+.

\code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}
Thus on each mistake, we decrease the cost by at least 1, and since the 
cost is never negative, the algorithm makes less than $(n+1)^K$
mistakes total.

the qed box at the same level as the equation.

\section{To Illustrate an Algorithm}

This is the command to use when you want to illustrate an algorithm
with some pseudo code. A backslash followed with a space will
indent the line. Every line will be printed
as it is seen on the screen. Blank lines will be preserved.
Math and font changes may be used. 

If you want to break lines on the screen but not break the line
in the results, use `\%' at the end of line, as you see in
the fifth line in this example.

The command
\verb+\bit+ will produce bold italics if you are using PostScript fonts, 
boldface in Computer Modern. \verb+\note{}+ will position the
note on the right margin. A backslash followed by a space
will provide a space a bit wider than the width of 2 `M's.
(\verb+\spanbothcolumns+ is used for this example because
it is too wide to fit into a single column. 
Send the algorithm to the bottom of the page
with \verb+\begin{figure}[b]+...\verb+\end{figure}+.)

\section{User Interface Environment}

These macros are designed to help the author demonstrate
an user interface. The environment should start and end with:
\verb+\endtwocolumns...\twocolumns+. 
This environment is too wide for one column so we must
end the two column format and then re-start the
two column format afterwards. Next we must start
the environment with\newline
\verb+\begin{interface}...\end{interface}+. 

Winline can be used like this:
\verb+\winline{<window number>}{<kind of window>}+ or like this\newline 
\verb+\winline{}{<kind of window>}+ for an unnumbered window.

\section{End of Article}
When you use the template file you will be sure to get
the ending parts of the article in the right order.
End matter should go in this order:

\begin{verbatim}
acknowledgements
appendix
endnotes
references
author biography
end of article
\end{verbatim}

Each article must end with the command:
\verb+\end{article}+. This command is found in the
template file. Please do not delete it.

The use of these parts is straight-forward with the
exception of the references which will be explained
in more depth in the next section. Notice that if you choose to
use an appendix, you only need the command \verb+\appendix+.
You need not follow it with \verb+\chapter{Appendix...}+ or
\verb+\section{Appendix...}+. Equations, tables, and figures
numbers will include an `A' for appendix.

In the final production stage of the article, Kluwers may
add space above the author biography to accomodate a photo.
There is no reason for the author to worry about how much
space to leave at this point.

\section{References}
References may be made with or without Bibtex. This section will
demonstrate how to make references without Bibtex; the following
section will describe the steps needed to make a bibliography with
BibTeX.

There are two ways to make a reference section. First is the
way to make numbered references and reference citations. Second
is the method of making alphabetical references.

Here is the way to make the numbered references.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{references}
....
\end{references}
\end{verbatim}

Each reference item starts 
with the command \verb+\bibitem+ followed by a term surrounded
by curly brackets which is used for cross-referencing the 
bibliographic entry. The number of the bibliographic
entry will be printed when the term is used with \verb+\cite+:
\verb+\cite{jacobs}+, for example. (The file must be \LaTeX ed
twice for this to work. The first time the file is processed,
\verb+\cite{label}+ will produce `[?]'.)


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Here is a citation from the reference section: \cite{jacobs}.

\begin{references}
\bibitem{francis} Francis, M., ``Out-of-band response of array antennas,''
Antenna Meas.  Tech. Proc., September 28--October 2, 1987, Seattle, p.~14.

\bibitem{jacobs}Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning

\endresults
}


\newpage
\subsection{Making an Alphabetical Reference Section}
To make a alphabetized reference section is called with
the commands \newline
\verb+\begin{alphareferences}...\end{alphareferences}+.

It can be used in two ways. 

The first is to enter your
references alphabetically with a blank line between entries.
When you want to cite these references in your text, you
refer to the entry without using \verb+\cite{}+. For instance,


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Maude Francis, (Francis, 87) showed important new results
with array antennas.

\begin{alphareferences}
Francis, M., ``Out-of-band response of array 
antennas,'' Antenna Meas.  Tech. Proc., September 28--October 2,
1987, Seattle, p.~14.

Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning
Phased Array,'' Microwaves, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.
\end{alphareferences}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode

\results

Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes Scanning
Phased Array,'' Microwaves, April 1982, pp.\ 69--70.
\end{alphareferences}
\endresults
\newpage
If you want to use alphabetical references but still
use \verb+\cite{}+ you can
precede each entry with
\verb+\bibitem[<term as it will print>]{<term you write in text>}+

When you want to cite these references in your text, you
refer to the entry using \verb+\cite{}+. For instance,


\code
\begin{verbatim}
Maude Francis, \cite{fr87} showed important new results
with array antennas.  

\begin{alphareferences}
\bibitem[Jacobs, 1982]{ja82}Jacobs, E., ``Design Method Optimizes

\section{Using BibTeX}
The Kluwer large journal style does allow the use of BibTeX.

BibTeX is a separate program which can be used with LaTeX to
produce a database file and build a bibliography. Its use is described
in the LaTeX book, p. 74--75, and p.~140--147.  
If you have never used Bibtex before,
you might consider doing so. The major advantages to using BibTeX are
that you can build a database of your references
that you can reuse for other books or articles, and
you can choose from a number of bibliographic styles.

To use BibTeX follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Make a xxx.bib file, with `xxx' being any file name you choose. 
This is the database file
including all the references. The form that these entries should take
is described in the LaTeX book.

\item
In your .tex file you must enter
\verb+\bibliographystyle{(style)}+. Your choices
of bibliography style are:\hfill\break
{\tt plain, unsrt, alpha, abbrv}. \hfill\break
The styles
are described on p.~74 of the LaTeX book. 
For the style of this journal, please use {\tt plain}.


Next you must write \verb+\bibliography{xxx}+, with `xxx' being the name of 
the .bib database file that you have written. You can also use more
than one .bib file, in which case you must separate the filenames with
a comma: \verb+\bibliography{xxx,yyy}+.

\item
Run Latex on the .tex document, producing the usual .aux file. When you
look at the .aux file you will see that it now contains
\verb+\bibstyle{(style)}+ and \verb+\bibdata{xxx}+.

\item
Run BibTex on the .tex document, producing  a .bbl file, 

\item
And, finally, run LaTeX on the .tex file, and Voila! there is your
bibliography, neatly done in the style you have chosen. The citations
in the text will also take the form you have chosen when you named
the bibliography style.
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
Here is an example:

First we make a file called sample.bib which contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
@BOOK	(samp:key,
	AUTHOR = "Strunk, Jr., William and E. B. White",
	TITLE= "The Elements of Style",
	PUBLISHER = "Macmillan",
	EDITION = "Third",
	YEAR = 1979,
	ADDRESS = "New York")

@BOOK	(second:thing,
	AUTHOR = "Calvin Coolidge",
	TITLE= "The Cats of Maine",
	PUBLISHER = "Silly Press",
	YEAR = 1984,
	ADDRESS = "Chatham, Maine, USA")
\end{verbatim}

Then, in our .tex file we enter citations and the two
bibliography commands:

\vskip-24pt
\code
\begin{verbatim}
Here are citations, \cite{samp:key}, \cite{second:thing}.

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{sample}
\end{verbatim}
\endcode
\vskip-24pt

Next, we run LaTeX on the .tex file. When we look at the .aux
file we have just produced, we see that it now contains these entries:

\begin{verbatim}
\bibstyle{plain}
\bibdata{sample}
...
\end{verbatim}


Then  we run BibTeX on the same .tex file to
produce the .bbl file. You can look at, and edit the .bbl file
if you'd like. Finally, we re-LaTeX our .tex file and produce these results:

{ \linewidth=30pc
\vskip-12pt
\vskip-1pt
\results

Here are citations, [2], [1].

\begin{thebibliography}{1}
\bibitem{second:thing}

\newblock Silly Press, Chatham, Maine, USA, 1984.

\begin{abstract}
Engineered Conditioning (EC) is a Genetic Algorithm operator
that works together with the typical genetic algorithm operators;
mate selection, crossover, and mutation, in order to improve
convergence toward an optimal multiple fault diagnosis.  When
incorporated within a typical genetic algorithm, the resulting {\it
hybrid} scheme produces improved reliability by exploiting the global
nature of the genetic algorithm as well as ``local'' improvement
capabilities of the Engineered Conditioning operator.

We show the significance of the Engineered Conditioning operator
during Multiple Fault Diagnosis (i.e., finding the collection of
simultaneously occurring disorders that best explains the observed
symptoms or disorder manifestations). Within the Mulitple Fault
Diagnosis domain, we show the improvement of diagnostic reliability
when using the engineered conditioning operator with the genetic
algorithm compared to results from the genetic algorithm without the
new operator. Reliability is based on the number of diagnostic trials
for which the two versions of the genetic algorithm find the optimal
diagnosis.  For comparison purposes, optimal diagnoses have been
computed using a search method that is guaranteed to find the optimal
solution.

\section{Introduction}
Diagnosis is the process of determining the correct problem from a
collection of problems given a set of symptoms that indicate a
problem exists.  Common experiences with this process include visits
to the physician in order to determine our illness (disease) and
visits to our local mechanic to determine the cause (fault) of a
poorly operating car.  In either case, we report the symptoms of the
problem to the diagnostician (physician or mechanic) who determines
the most likely cause that best explains these symptoms.  In terms of
the complexity of determining the correct diagnosis, the
diagnostician must find a diagnosis from a set of possible diagnoses.
This is the situation in which we find ourselves.
That is, if a total of 10 diseases or faults are being considered
where only one of these is the correct one then at most 10 diagnoses
will need to be evaluated.
\end{article}
\endjourpage


\begin{verbatim}
However, in the more typical case where several problems
(diseases/faults) may occur simultaneously, the complexity of finding
a proper diagnosis increases {\it exponentially} with the number of
problems. For example, using the 10 problems considered above, the
situation changes such that any of the 1024 (i.e., $2^{10}$) possible
combinations of problems may turn out to be the correct diagnosis.

\subsection{Preliminary definition of optimization}
Our assumption has been that the goal of categorization is to predict
unknown features of various objects that we encounter.

\subsubsection{The structure of the environment}
Our theory of the structure of the environment has been focused the
structure of living things (arguably, the largest portion of the
objects in the world) because of the aid biology gives in objectively
specifying the organization of these objects.

\section{Formatting Mathematical Expressions}
Formally, this amounts to calculating:
\begin{equation}
g_i(y|f)=\sum_x P(x|F_n)f_i(y|x)
\end{equation}
where $g_i(y|F_n)$ is the function specifying the probability an object will
display a value $y$ on a dimension $i$ given $F_n$ the observed feature
structure of all the objects.


Here is an example of a wide equation:
\begin{wideequation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\sum_k P(k) \sum_i \sum_y f_i(y|k)^2
\end{equation}
\end{wideequation}

In this wide equation the `splitmath' command is used to split 
the math into two lines, moving the top half to the left
and the bottom to the right.
\[
\begin{splitmath}
[-(\Im(\alpha) +\Im(\delta)/2 -(\Im(\beta)-(\Im(\gamma))2
\\
(\Re(\alpha)-\Re(\delta))/2\quad(\Re(\beta)+\Re(\gamma))/2]
\end{splitmath}
\]

Or, if you want a numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{splitmath}
[-(\Im(\alpha) +\Im(\delta)/2 -(\Im(\beta)-(\Im(\gamma))2
\\
(\Re(\alpha)-\Re(\delta))/2\quad(\Re(\beta)+\Re(\gamma))/2]
\end{splitmath}
\end{equation}

\section{Theorems, Proofs, Examples, etc.}

\begin{proclaim}{Theorem 1}LEARN-MONOTONE-K makes at most
$(n+1)^K$ mistakes on any monotone K-CNF formula. (Recall that
$n$ is the size of the largest example seen.) 
\end{proclaim}

\begin{proof}
The running time of this algorithm is clearly polynomial in 
{\bf size}$(f_T)$ and the length of the longest example seen.
If a proof ends with displayed math \verb+\inmathqed+
must be used.

This is an example of a proof of a particular theorem.
The term you want to use should follow `proof' in
square brackets.
\end{proof}
\goodbreak % added to make next column start here.


In this section, we present an efficient formula for computing $P(B_X, D)$.
We do so by first introducing two assumptions having to do with our
database.

\begin{demo}{Assumption 1}
The database variables, which we denote as $Z$, are discrete.
\end{demo}

\begin{demo}{Assumption 2}
The database constants, which we denote as $C$, are also discrete.
\end{demo}

\begin{example}
Consider an example in which~$B_S$ is the structure.
The term $P(B_X)$ is our probability---prior to observing the data
in database $D$---that the data-generating process is a belief network with
structure $B_{S1}$. This network can be seen to have the following
qualities: monotonicity, and serial portability.
\end{example}

\subsection{Sample Text}
Diagnosis is the process of determining the correct problem from a
collection of problems given a set of symptoms that indicate a
problem exists.  Common experiences with this process include visits
to the physician in order to determine our illness (disease) and
visits to our local mechanic to determine the cause (fault) of a
poorly operating car.  In either case, we report the symptoms of the
problem to the diagnostician (physician or mechanic) who determines
the most likely cause that best explains these symptoms.  In terms of
the complexity of determining the correct diagnosis, the
diagnostician must find a diagnosis from a set of possible diagnoses.
This is the situation in which we find ourselves.
That is, if a total of 10 diseases or faults are being considered
where only one of these is the correct one.

\section{Making Tables}
Like figures, tables can be positioned in the columns at the top,
bottom, or where written in the text, and also can be made to span
both columns at the top, middle or bottom of the page. 

The table caption should be written above the table. Table notes can
be used below the table. The method of producing table notes can be
seen when looking at the code used to produce this example.
When making the table, please use \verb+\hline+ at the top of the
table, underneath the column headers and at the end of the table.
You are discouraged from using vertical lines in tables, but it you
must include vertical lines, you must also use \verb+\savehline+
instead of \verb+\hline+ or there will be a gap between the vertical
and horizontal lines.  (\verb+\hline+ has been redefined to add some
vertical space above and below it.)

\subsection{Seeds of clauses}
If an example satisfies the seed of a clause, then it satisfies the clause
as well. In addition, seeds have the following property:

\endtwocolumns
\endjourpage



\begin{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] 
If a seed of clause $c_T$, and example {\bf x} satisfies $c_T$ but not $c$, 
then {\bf x} has at least one attibute in $c_T$ that is not in $c$.
\hfill({\tt*})
\end{itemize}
The procedure below...

The answer depends on two factors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf Certainty of inference:} The probability of the inference rules
used to find or infer answers to knowledge goals, or the likelihood
that the conclusions will be true. In a logic system where an
inference rule represents a deduction, this probability is 1.

\item
{\bf Cost of inference:} The cost of making inferences or of matching
and applying inference rules.  The cheaper the inference, the more it
is worth the system's while to make it.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Memory goals:}Knowledge goals of a dynamic memory program,
arising from memory-level tasks. A dynamic memory must be able to
notice similarities, match incoming concepts to stereotypes in
memory, form generalizations, and so on.

\paragraph{Explanation goals:}Goals of an explainer that arise from
explanation-level tasks, including the detection and resolution of
anomalies,and the building of motivational and causal explanations
for the events in the story in order to understand why the characters
acted as they did, or why certain events occurred or did not occur.

\paragraph{The READ step:}AQUA reads a piece of text, guided by the
questions in memory.  It tries to answer these questions using the
new piece of information.

\begin{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item[READ] some text, focussing attention on interesting input as
determined below. Build minimal representations in memory.

\item[Retrieve]extant knowledge goals or questions indexed in memory that 
might be relevant.
\begin{description}
\item[Answer question] by either confirming or refuting it.

\item[Propagate]back to the hypothesis that the question originated from.
\end{description}
\item[Explain]the new input if necessary, i.e., if interesting and
not already explained.

\section{Material that spans both columns}
The example above shows how to fit in a small bit of code that
is too wide for one column.

The following extended example is too wide to fit within the columns
so it is good to be able to have it span both columns.
We end the columns with the command \verb+\endtwocolumns+

The procedure below...



The answer depends on two factors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\bf Certainty of inference:} The probability of the inference
rules used to find or infer answers to knowledge goals, or the
likelihood that the conclusions will be true. In a logic system
where an inference rule represents a deduction, this probability is 1.

\item
{\bf Cost of inference:} The cost of making inferences or of matching and applying inference rules.
The cheaper the inference, the more it
is worth the system's while to make it.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Memory goals:}Knowledge goals of a dynamic memory program,
arising from memory-level tasks. A dynamic memory must be able to
notice similarities, match incoming concepts to stereotypes in
memory, form generalizations, and so on.

\paragraph{Explanation goals:}Goals of an explainer that arise from
explanation-level tasks, including the detection and resolution of
anomalies,and the building of motivational and causal explanations
for the events in the story in order to understand why the characters
acted as they did, or why certain events occurred or did not occur.

\paragraph{The READ step:}AQUA reads a piece of text, guided by the
questions in memory.  It tries to answer these questions using the
new piece of information.

\begin{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item[READ] some text, focussing attention on interesting input as
determined below. Build minimal representations in memory.

\item[Retrieve]extant knowledge goals or questions indexed in memory that 
might be relevant.
\begin{description}
\item[Answer question] by either confirming or refuting it.

\item[Propagate]back to the hypothesis that the question originated from.
\end{description}
\item[Explain]the new input if necessary, i.e., if interesting and
not already explained.
\end{description}

\section{Material that spans both columns}
The example above shows how to fit in a small bit of code that
is too wide for one column.

The following extended example is too wide to fit within the columns
so it is good to be able to have it span both columns.
We end the columns with the command \verb+\endtwocolumns+
and start the two column format again with the command
\verb+\twocolumns+


This example also shows the use of commands to format
computer screen interface examples.

\begin{article}
\section{Introduction}
During the last ten years,
a lot of attention has been paid to the problem of automatic design of 
{\it Systolic Algorithms} (SAs) [1]-[5]. A method for
automatic design takes a specification of the SA.
Since the final objective is to implement
the SA in hardware, aspects such
as limitations in the number of PEs, fault aspects such as
limitations should be taken into account in the design procedure.
Within this context, this paper proposes a method to transform SAs for 
efficient implementation using {\it Pipelined Functional Units}
(PFUs).
