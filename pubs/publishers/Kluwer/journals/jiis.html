AIMS AND SCOPE

The mission of the Journal of Intelligent Information
Systems: Integrated AI and Database Technologies is to
present research and development focused on the integration of
Artificial Intelligence and Database Management technologies to
provide models, architectures, tools and techniques for the next
generation of systems - Intelligent Information Systems. The
Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is a technical
journal that focuses on the creation of information systems that
exhibit intelligent behavior and embody intelligence in their
reasoning and management processes.

Increasingly, knowledge-directed inference processes are being used to
produce information from the data contained in large shared databases.
The goal of the Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is to
provide a forum for those interested in making information systems
intelligent in which they can publish their original research and
development results. For us, intelligence may be manifested in a user
interface which has knowledge of user profiles and preferences and can
use this knowledge to foster more productive human-computer
interactions; intelligence may be embodied in the loosely or
tightly-coupled architectures for integrating knowledge-based systems
with database systems; and intelligence may reside in query
optimization algorithms that incorporate semantic integrity
constraints, heuristics as well as database statistics.

Journal of Intelligent Information Systems is an archival,
peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing the following types of
high-quality, state-of-the-art papers: - research papers - invited
papers - workshop and conference reports - survey and tutorial
articles - book reviews. In addition to papers Journal of
Intelligent Information Systems also presents: - meeting
announcements - reviews - open problems and proposed solutions.
