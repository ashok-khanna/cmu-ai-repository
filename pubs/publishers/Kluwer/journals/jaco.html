AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics provides a single
forum for papers on algebraic combinatorics which, at present, are
distributed throughout a number of journals. Within the last decade or
so, algebraic combinatorics has evolved into a mature, established and
identifiable area of mathematics. Research contributions in the field
are increasingly seen to have substantial links with other areas of
mathematics.

The journal publishes papers in which combinatorics and algebra
interact in a significant and interesting fashion. This interaction
might occur through the study of combinatorial structures using
algebraic methods, or the application of combinatorial methods to
algebraic problems. The combinatorics might be enumerative, or involve
matriods, posets, polytopes, codes, designs, or finite geometries. The
algebra could be group theory, representation theory, lattice theory
or commutative algebra, to mention just a few possibilities. Papers on
applications are welcome.

The Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics is published quarterly,
with distribution to librarians, researchers in combinatorics, and
mathematical and computer scientists with a strong interest in
combinatorial structure.

The journal maintains strict refereeing procedures through its
editorial policies in order to publish papers of only the highest
quality.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that
has neither appeared in, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit five hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Karen S. Cullen
JOURNAL OF ALGEBRAIC COMBINATORICS
Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528
Norwell,  MA 02061           E-mail: Karen@world.std.com

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
include a telephone number, fax number and e-mail address, if
available.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.


STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double space in English; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper double spaced with items referred to by numerals
and put in alphabetical order.  References in the text should be
denoted by numbers in square brackets, e.g. [12]. References
should be complete, in the following style:

Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume (year),
inclusive page numbers.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).

Examples as follows:

(Book) I.G. Macdonald, Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials,
Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1979..

(Journal Article) A.O. Morris, "The spin representation of the
symmetric group," Canadian Journal of Mathematics 17(1965), 543-
549.

(Conference Proceedings) A. A. Ivanov, "Geometric presentations
of groups with an application to the Monster," Proc. ICM-90,
Kyoto, Japan, 1990, vol. 2, pp.385-395, Springer-Verlag, 1991.

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Use ?? as an end of proof symbol. Journal style for
letter symbols is as follows: variables, italic type (indicated
by underline); constants, roman text type; matrices and vectors,
boldface type (indicated by wavy underline).  In word-processor
manuscripts, use appropriate typeface.  It will be assumed that
letters in displayed equations are to be set in italic type
unless you mark them otherwise.  All letter symbols in text
discussion must be marked if they should be italic or boldface. 
Indicate best breaks for equations in case they will not fit on
one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Figure 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the contact author for proofing, unless otherwise
informed.  The proofread copy should be received back by the
Publisher within 72 hours.
