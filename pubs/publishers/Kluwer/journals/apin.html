Applied Intelligence
The International Journal of Artificial Intelligence, Neural
Networks, and Complex Problem-Solving Technologies

AIMS AND SCOPE

The International Journal of Applied Intelligence
provides a medium for exchanging scientific research and technological
achievements accomplished by the international community. The focus of
the work is on research in artificial intelligence and neural
networks. The journal addresses issues involving solutions of
real-life manufacturing, defense, management, government and
industrial problems which are too complex to be solved through
conventional approaches and which require the simulation of
intelligent thought processes, heuristics, applications of knowledge,
and distributed and parallel processing. The integration of these
multiple approaches in solving complex problems is of particular
importance.

The emphasis of the reported work is on new and original research and
technological developments rather than reports on the application of
existing technology to different sets of data. Earlier work reported
in these fields has been limited in application and has solved
simplified, structured problems which rarely occur in real-life
situations. Only recently have researchers started addressing real and
complex issues applicable to difficult problems. The journal welcomes
such developments and functions as a catalyst in disseminating the
original research and technological achievements of the international
community in these areas.


INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that
has neither appeared in, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  The emphasis of the reported work will be on new and
original research and technological developments covering
methodologies as well as applications in the area associated with
artificial intelligence, knowledge-based expert systems, neural
networks, intelligent distributed and parallel processing, and
complex-problem solving technologies.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Karen S. Cullen
APIN - Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528

Norwell,  MA 02061

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.  Some typical key word examples are: machine
learning, planning, scheduling, monitoring, diagnosis, modeling,
design, robotics, and neural net architectures.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.  Upon acceptance of the paper, authors
must supply a brief biographical sketch.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  Authors should try to keep the length of the paper (including
figures) under 36 double-spaced pages.

7.  All papers should be written in English.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an 
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. Abstracts
will be printed with the article.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper.  References should be numbered in order of
citation within the paper.  They should be referred to within the
text by numberals in square brackets, e.g. [12].  References
should be complete, in the following style:

Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, chapter or
page numbers (if desired), year.

Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information, Freeman:
San Francisco, CA. 1982.

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Original for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING
