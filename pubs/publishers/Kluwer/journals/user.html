User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction

An International Journal

Editor

Dept. of Information Science, University of Konstanz, Germany

Scope
User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction (UMUAI) provides an
interdisciplinary forum for the dissemination of new research results on
computer systems that adapt to their current users and employ user models
to do so. The journal publishes high-quality original papers from, e.g.,
the following areas:

- acquisition of user and student models
- conceptual models, mental models
- dialog planning and response tailoring
- levels of user expertise
- explanation strategies
- intelligent information retrieval
- plan recognition and generation
- presentation planning
- recognition and correction of user misconceptions
- user stereotypes
- formal representation of user and student models
- shell systems for user modeling
- tutoring strategies

Relevant papers from the fields of psychology, linguistics and the
instructional sciences are also considered if they bear implications for
the design of computational systems.
