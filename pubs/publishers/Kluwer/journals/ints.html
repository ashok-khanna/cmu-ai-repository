AIMS AND SCOPE

Interface Science concentrates on the structure and
properties of the internal interfaces in solids. The inherently
interdisciplinary nature of interfacial phenomena extends through
materials science, physics, chemistry and mechanics, spanning a broad
range of materials. Nevertheless, the phenomena underlying interface
science serve as unifying factors, spanning in a wide range of
materials. It is just such a focus on interfacial phenomena that makes
the journal Interface Science unique, giving a wide appeal
to investigators to grain boundaries, stacking defects, interfaces
between dissimilar phases, etc. A Major focus of the journal is on the
interfaces between dissimilar materials, such as the composite
materials and films on substrates. Interface Science also covers
a wide variety of physical phenomena reflecting the disparate reasons
for either creating an interface or the means by which an interface
can be created. Structural properties, including the atomic structure
and morphology of interfaces, are key aspects of the journal's
coverage.

Interface Science covers the following topics:
- Electronic and magnetic properties of interfaces
- Effects of interfaces on bulk electronic and magnetic phenomena
- Interfacial segregation and interfacial phases
- Transport along/through interfaces
- Chemical effects at interfaces
- Mechanical properties at interfaces
- Effects of interfaces on bulk mechanical properties
- Thermodynamic properties of interfaces
- Interface migration, including twinning, grain growth, phase
  transformations, etc.
- Electronic properties and bonding at interfaces.

The list is by no means exhaustive. In its endeavour to be a bridge
between different fields, explaining phenomena and leading to a broad,
cross-disciplinary understanding, Interface Science is set to
become the journal of record in the field.
