AIMS AND SCOPE

Multidimensional Systems and Signal Processing is an
archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing survey and
original papers, spanning fundamentals as well as applicable research
contributions.

While the subject of multidimensional systems is concerned with
mathematical issues designed to tackle a broad range of models, its
applications in signal processing have been known to cover spatial and
temporal signals of diverse physical origin. The current problem
faced, due to the widely scattered mature of publications in this
area, will be circumvented through the unity of theme in this journal,
so that research is facilitated and expected with much reduced
duplication of effort much enhanced communication.

Topics of current interest include, but are not limited to:
- blurred and noisy image processing - multidimensional signal
reconstruction from partial or incomplete observations and projections
- signal modeling - spectral analysis and transform techniques - array
processing - linear and nonlinear prediction and filtering of
multidimensional processes - multidimensional spectrum estimation -
multivariate approximation - multidimensional realization theory -
multidimensional sampling strategies - interpolation and decimation
schemes - velocity filtering - fast processing of remotely sensed
multidimensional data - multivariate polynomial and matrix
factorization schemes - computer algebra for symbolic and algebraic
manipulations - concurrent architecture for multidimensional signal
processing - visual communications - neural networks and incorporate
of artificial intelligence techniques in spatio-temporal data
processing

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original works
which have not appeared, nor are under consideration, in other
journals.  Papers which have previously appeared in conference
proceedings will also be considered, and this should be so
indicated at the time of submission.

E Mail: nkb@psuecl.bitnet

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from five
to ten index terms (key phrases).

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations in the style
described below.  Alternatively, good quality copies may be sent
initially, with the originals ready to be sent immediately upon
acceptance of paper.  Also upon acceptance of the paper, authors
must supply a photograph and brief biographical sketch.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving your preferred address for
correspondence and return of proofs.  Please be sure to include
your telephone number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  Papers exceeding 40 pages in length (including figures) may
be returned to the author for shortening.

7.  All papers should be written in English.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Provide an informative 100-to 250-word abstract at the head
of the manuscript.  The abstracts are printed with the articles.

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered references.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should be numbered and listed in the order of
citation in a separate section at the end of the paper, with
citations by numbers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2], etc.).

Style for papers: Author (initials and surname), "Paper Title,"
Journal Title, volume number, date, page numbers.  For example:
J. Fox, G. Surace, and P.A. Thomas, "A Self-Testing 2-um CMOS
Chip Set for FFT Applications," IEEE Journal of Solid-State
Circuits, vol. SC-22, 1987, pp. 15-19.

Style for books: Author, Book Title, location, publisher, date,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).  For example: P.M. Kogge,
The Architecture of Pipelined Computers, New York: McGraw-Hill
Book Co., 1981


5.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
zero crossings of the second derivative of the (a) Gaussian and
(b) sine filter for the same input function."

6.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as it should appear in
print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Original for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back, or at the bottom of the
front.

8.  Include a separate page listing the captions for all figures.

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the first named author for proofing.  The proofread
copy should be received back by the Publisher within 72 hours.

COPYRIGHT

Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be required to sign a
copyright form transferring the copyright from the authors or
their employers to the publisher.

REPRINTS

First-named authors will be entitled to fifty free reprints of
their paper.
