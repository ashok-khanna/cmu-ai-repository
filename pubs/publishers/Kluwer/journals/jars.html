Journal of Automated Reasoning

Editor-in-Chief:

SCOPE
The Journal of Automated Reasoning is an interdisciplinary journal that
maintains a balance between theory, implementation, and application. The
spectrum of material ranges from the presentation of a new inference rule
with proofs of its logical properties to a detailed account of a computer
program designed to solve some problem for industry. The papers published
in this journal are from, among others, the fields of automated theorem
proving, logic programming, expert systems, program synthesis and
validation, artificial intelligence, computational logic, robotics, and
various industrial applications. The papers share the common feature of
focusing on some aspect of automated reasoning, a field whose objective is
the design and implementation of a computer program that serves as an
assistant in solving problems and in answering questions that require
reasoning. The journal provides a forum and a means for exchanging
information for those interested purely in theory, those interested
primarily in implementation, and those interested in specific research and
industrial applications.
