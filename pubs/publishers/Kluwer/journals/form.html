AIMS AND SCOPE

The focus of this journal is on formal methods for designing,
implementing, and validating the correctness of hardware (VLSI) and
software systems. The stimulus for starting a journal with this goal
comes from both academia and industry. In both areas, interest in the
use of formal methods has increased rapidly during the past few years.
The enormous cost and time required to validate new designs has led to
the realization that more powerful techniques must be developed. A
number of techniques and tools are currently being devised for
improving the reliability, and robustness of complex hardwareand
software systems. While the boundary between the (sub)components of a
system that are cast in hardware, firmware, or software continues to
blur, the relevant design disciplines and formal methods are maturing
rapidly. Consequently, an important (and useful) collection of
commonly applicable formal methods are expected to emerge that will
strongly influence future design environments and design methods.
The journal is an international forum for the dissemination of
research related to the application and development of formal methods
in both hardware (VLSI) and software system design. Papers describing
original work in all aspects of formal methods as they relate to this
general area are invited.



INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original works
which have not appeared in, nor is under consideration by, other
journals.  Papers which have previously appeared in conference
proceedings will also be considered, and this should be so
indicated at the time of submission.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Judith Kemp

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.


STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space: use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title and provide an informative 100-250
word abstract at the head of the manuscript.  The abstracts are
printed with the article.  It should be a carefully worded
description of the problem, the key ideas introduced, and the
results. 

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper.  References should be complete, in the
following style:

  Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

  Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).
The references should be cited in the text using numbers, for
example [7].

5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters displayed are to be
set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All letter
symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should be
italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in case
they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Original for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."
