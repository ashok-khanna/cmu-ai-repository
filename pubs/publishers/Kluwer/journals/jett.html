AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and
Applications is an international forum for the dissemination of
research and application information in the area of electronic
testing. This is the only journal devoted specifically to electronic
testing. The papers for publication in Journal of Electronic
Testing: Theory and Applications will be selected through a peer
review to ensure originality, timeliness, and relevance. The journal
will provide archival material, and through its quick publication
cycle, will strive to bring recent results to researchers and
practitioners. While it will emphasize publication of preciously
unpublished material, conference papers of exceptional merit that
require wider exposure will, at the discretion of the editors, also be
published provided they meet the journal's peer review standard.
Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications
will also seek clearly written survey and review articles to promote
improved understanding of the state of the art.

Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications coverage
will include, but not be limited to the following topics:
- Testing of VLSI devices printed circuit boards, and electronic
systems
- Testing of analog and digital electronic circuits
- Testing of microprocessors, memories, and signal processing devices
- Fault modeling
- Test generation
- Fault simulation
- Testability analysis
- Design for testability
- Synthesis for testability
- Built-in self-test
- Test specification
- Fault tolerance
- Formal verification of hardware
- Simulation for verification
- Design debugging
- AI methods and expert systems for test and diagnosis
- Automatic test equipment (ATE)
- Test fixtures
- Electron Beam Test Systems
- Test programming
- Test data analysis
- Economics of testing
- Quality and reliability
- CAD Tools
- Testing of wafer-scale integration devices
- Testing of reliable systems
- Manufacturing yield and design for yield improvement 
- Failure mode analysis and process improvement

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that
has not appeared, nor is under consideration by, other journals. 
Papers which have previously appeared in conference proceedings
will also be considered, and this should be so indicated at the
time of submission.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Mrs. Karen S. Cullen
JETTA - Editorial Office
Kluwer Academic Publishers   Tel.: 617-871-6300
101 Philip Drive             FAX:  617-871-6528
Assinippi Park
Norwell,  MA 02061, U.S.A.

For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.  Some typical key word examples are: ATE, test
programming, logic simulation, fault modeling.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title and provide an informative 100 to
250 word abstract at the head of the manuscript.  The abstracts
are printed with the articles.  It should be a carefully worded
description of the problem, the key ideas introduced, and the
results. 

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper.  References should be numbered and listed in
order of citation in the text, with citations by numbers in
brackets.  References should be complete, in the following style:

Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).


5.  Type or mark mathematical copy exactly as they should appear
in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING

Page proofs for articles to be included in a journal issue will
be sent to the contact author for proofing, unless otherwise
informed.  The proofread copy should be received back by the
Publisher within 72 hours.
