AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of Systems Integration is a quarterly,
peer-reviewed publication containing original, survey, application,
and research papers on all topics related to systems integration. The
intent is to encompass a collection of papers that have heretofore
been dispersed throughout a wide body of literature involving the
interaction of disciplines, technologies, methods and machines
necessary to integrate various constituent systems.
The scope of this journal generally parallels the definition of the
integration of computers systems. However, it also deals with the
general integration of processes and systems, and the development of
mechanisms and tools enabling solutions to multidisciplinary problems
found in the computer services and manufacturing industries. This
journal focuses on the following critical steps found in effective
systems integration:
- Process characterization, to understand current process
capabilities, behaviors and interfaces, - Re-engineering and
simplification of processes from a system perspective, - Convergence
on a common system architecture with a unified language for data
management, and - Automation of the processes and systems.

Since the succesful implementation of these steps for systems
integration requires diverse knowledge bases and expertise in a
variety of areas, the journal also emphasizes additional topics such
as:
- managing knowledge and information that are physically distributed
in various databases,
- computer communications impact on the system process,
- dealing with heterogeneous computers and environments, and 
- coordinating diverse computer communiciation networks with
information networks.

The aim of the journal is to provide an international and
interdisciplinary forum for the dissemination of new theoretical and
applied research results, application information and the developments
concerning management of systems integration. For instance, it
disseminates research work which deals with the problems, issues and
solutions of integrated system design, implementation and performance;
and with integration technologies that apply to multidisciplinary
areas such as computer-aided software engineering, collaborative and
distributed systems, and computer integrated manufacturing systems.


JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION 

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work 
that has neither appeared in, nor is under consideration by,
other journals.  The emphasis of the reported work will be on new
and original research and technological developments covering
methodologies as well as applications in the areas associated
with systems integration.

PROCESS FOR SUBMISSION

1.  Authors should submit six hard copies of their final
manuscript to:

Professor Peter A. Ng
Department of Computer & Information Science  Tel.: 210-596-3366
New Jersey Institute of Technology            FAX:  201-596-5777 
Newark,  New Jersey 07102            email: ng_p@vienna.njit.edu  
     
For prompt attention, all correspondence can be directed to this
address.

2.  Enclose with each manuscript, on a separate page, from three
to five key words.  Some typical key word examples are:
automation, software engineering, computer-integrated
manufacturing systems, and software engineering.

3.  Enclose originals for the illustrations, in the style
described below, for one copy of the manuscript.  Photocopies of
the figures may accompany the remaining copies of the manuscript. 
Alternatively, original illustrations may be submitted after the
paper has been accepted.

4.  Enclose a separate page giving the preferred address of the
contact author for correspondence and return of proofs.  Please
be sure to include a telephone number and a fax number.

5.  The refereeing is done by anonymous reviewers.

6.  Authors should try to keep the length of the paper (including
figures) under 36 double-spaced pages.

7.  All papers should be written in English.


STYLE FOR MANUSCRIPT

1.  Typeset, double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet only
(laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication
acceptable).

2.  Use an informative title for the paper and include an
abstract of 100 to 250 words at the head of the manuscript.  The
abstract should be a carefully worded description of the problem
addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results.  Abstracts
will be printed with the article.  

3.  Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing all footnotes,
beginning with "Affiliation of author" and continuing with
numbered footnotes.  Acknowledgement of financial support may be
given if appropriate.

4.  References should appear in a separate bibliography at the
end of the paper.  They should be referred to by numerals in
square brackets, e.g., [12].  References should be complete, in
the following style:

  Style for papers: Author(s) initials followed by last name for
each author, paper title, publication name, volume, inclusive
page numbers, month and year.

  Style for books: Author(s), title, publisher,location, year,
chapter or page numbers (if desired).
  Examples as follows:
  (Book) D. Marr, Vision, a Computational Investigation into the
Human Representation & Processing of Visual Information. 
Freeman: San Francisco, CA, 1982.
  (Journal Article) A. Rosenfeld and M. Thurston, "Edge and curve
detection for visual scene analysis," IEEE Trans. Comput. vol.
C.-20, pp. 562-569, 1971.
  (Conference Proceedings) A. Witkin, "Scales space filtering,"
in Proc. Int. Joint Conf. Artif. Intell., Karlsruhe, West
Germany, 1983, pp.1019-1021.
   (Lab. memo.) A.L. Yuille and T. Poggio, "Scaling theorems for
zero crossings," M.I.T. Artif. Intell. Lab., Massachusetts Inst.
Technol., Cambridge, MA, A.I. Memo 722, 1983.

5.  Type or mark mathematical expressions exactly as it should
appear in print.  Journal style for letter symbols is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, roman
text type; matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy
underline).  In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate
typeface.  It will be assumed that letters in displayed equations
are to be set in italic type unless you mark them otherwise.  All
letter symbols in text discussion must be marked if they should
be italic or boldface.  Indicate best breaks for equations in
case they will not fit on one line.

STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and
of good contrast.  We regret that we cannot provide drafting or
art service.

2.  Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India
ink on paper, or board.  Use 8 1/2 by 11-inch size sheets if
possible, to simplify handling of the manuscript.

3.  Each figure should be mentioned in the text and numbered
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Specify the desired
location of each figure in the text, but place the figure itself
of a separate page following the text.

4.  Number each table consecutively using Arabic numerals. 
Please label any material that can be typeset as a table,
reserving the term "figure" for material that has been drawn. 
Specify the desired location of each table in the text, but place
the table itself on a separate page following the text.  Type a
brief title above each table.

5.  All lettering should be large enough to permit legible
reduction.

6.  Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and
gradation, and any reasonable size.

7.  Number each original on the back.

8.  Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in
proper style for the typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 3. Examples of the
fault coverage of random vectors in (a) combinational and (b)
sequential circuits."

PROOFING
