AIMS AND SCOPE

The Journal of VLSI Signal Processing publishes research
and survey papers on the design and implementation of signal
processing systems with VLSI circuits. It is distributed to engineers,
researchers and educators in the fields of VLSI design and signal
processing.

The key subject areas of interest to the journal of VLSI Signal
Processing are:
- design and analysis of signal processing algorithms and architecture
- performance analysis (including measurement, modeling, and
  simulation) of signal processing systems
- VLSI design methodology (including silicon compilation)
- design of arithmetic circuits and VLSI components used in signal
  processing (such as multipliers, dividers, and digital filter sections)
- specialized number systems (including on-line arithmetic, residue
  number systems, and logarithmic number systems)
- application of advanced technology (e.g., WSI, ECL, GaAs, etc.) to
  signal processing
- generic and programmable processors
- special purpose signal processor architectures (including parallel
  and pipelined signal processors)
- systolic/wave front arrays
- neural nets

`The material in the Journal of VLSI Signal Processing is
of high standard, with contributions from many of the well-known
individuals and organizations in the field'

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Authors are invited to submit high quality original work which
has not appeared (nor is under consideration) in other journals,
transactions or books.

SUBMISSION

1.  Send five copies of the manuscript to the Coordinating Editor
at the following address:

Judy Kemp
Kluwer Academic Publishers   
101 Philip Drive
Assinippi Park
Norwell,  MA 02061     U.S.A.

Alternatively, manuscripts may be sent to any member of the
Editorial Board.

The copies should be typed, double spaced on one side of 8.5 by
11 inch sheets only.  Typeset, laser printed, typewritten, or
good quality copies are acceptable provided that they are sharp,
clean, and of good contrast.  A separate set of original camera
ready illustrations should accompany the manuscript.

2.  In the case of previously published material, the author is
responsible for obtaining the necessary copyright releases.  In
all cases, the author must obtain all necessary institution
and/or government clearances prior to submission.  Revisions of
material published previously in limited distribution workshop,
symposium, and conference proceedings will be considered,
provided that the previous publication is identified at the time
of submission.  The author is responsible for obtaining written
permission to reproduce any material that has appeared in another
publication.

3.  The copyright of all papers published in the Journal will be
vested in the publisher.  The transfer of copyright agreement
must be executed and signed by the author (or the author's
employer, if appropriate) before publication.

4.  A cover letter should accompany each submission indicating
the name, address and telephone number of the author to whom all
correspondence should be sent.

5.  All submissions will be reviewed by anonymous referees prior
to acceptance.

6.  Quick publication decisions can be achieved if manuscripts
are prepared according to the following instructions.

MANUSCRIPTS

1.  Manuscripts should be limited to thirty pages of text with no
more than fifteen pages of artwork.

2.  Each manuscript should be complete with a 100 to 250 word
abstract which will be printed at the beginning of the paper.

3.  The author affiliation and complete mailing address should be
listed at the beginning of the manuscript.  Acknowledgement of
support, if appropriate should be provided in a separate section
at the end of manuscript.

4.  The use of footnotes is strongly discouraged; the material
should be included as parenthetical material in the text wherever
possible.

5.  References should be numbered and listed in order of citation
in a separate section at the end of the paper, with citations by
numbers in square brackets (e.g., [1], [2], etc.).  

Style for papers: Author (initials and surname), "Paper Title,"
Journal Title, volume number, date, page numbers. For example: J.
Fox, G. Surace, and P.A. Thomas, "A Self-Testing 2? CMOS Chip Set
for FFT Applications," IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol.
SC-22, 1987, pp. 15-19.

Style for books: Author, Book Title, location, publisher, date,
chapter or page numbers (if desired). For example: P.M. Kogge,
The Architecture of Pipelined Computers, New York: McGraw-Hill
Book Co., 1981.


ILLUSTRATIONS

1.  Original illustrations should be laser printer output or
India ink on paper.  Original illustrations should be submitted
on separate sheets of paper following the text. When
illustrations are shown within the text, original art must be
provided. Illustrations should be sharp, clean, and of reasonable
contrast on  8.5 by 11-inch or smaller sheets.

2.  Number all artwork on the back or bottom. Indicate the
preferred orientation.

3.  Photographs should be black and white glossy prints.

4. Graphs should show only the coordinate axes with tick marks
(or at most a few grid lines).  Lettering and lines should be
large enough to permit significant reduction.

5.  Provide a list of all table and figure captions on a separate
sheet.  The captions should be in proper style for the
typesetter, e.g., "Fig. 2. Logic diagram of the parallel
multiplier."

TECHNICAL BIOGRAPHY

Enclose a brief technical biography and photograph of each
author.

PROOFING

Page proofs will be sent to the first named author for proofing. 
The proofread copy should be returned to Publisher within 72
hours.


REPRINTS

The first named author will be entitled to fifty free reprints of
each paper.  All authors will receive complimentary copies of the
issue containing their paper.
