AIMS AND SCOPE

LISP and Symbolic Computation is an international journal
that presents a forum for current and evolving symbolic computing,
focusing on LISP and object-oriented programming.
Key subject areas and topics covered in the journal include:
- Programming language notations for symbolic computing, such as data
  abstraction, parallelism, lazy evaluation, infinite data objects, self
  reference, message passing, generic functions, inheritance,
  encapsulation, protection, meta-objects.
- Implementations and techniques, such as specialized architectures,
  compiler design, combinatory models, garbage collection, storage
  management, performance analysis, smalltalks, flavors, common loops,
  etc.
- Programming logics, such as semantics and reasoning about programs,
  types and type inference.
- Programming environments and tools, such as knowledge-based
  programming tools, program transformation, specifications, debugging
  tools.
- Applications and experience with symbolic computing, such as real
  time programming, artificial intelligence tools, experience with LISP,
  object-oriented programming, window systems, user interfaces,
  operating systems, parallel/distributed computing.

Information for Authors.

LISP AND SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION: An International Journal is a
publication for significant papers on all aspects of LISP and
object-oriented programming.  Papers submitted are judged
primarily on originality and relevance.

SCOPE

Programming language notations for symbolic computing (e.g., data
abstraction, parallelism, lazy evaluation, infinite data objects,
self-reference, message-passing, generic functions, inheritance,
encapsulation, protection, metaobjects).

Implementations and techniques (e.g., specialized architectures,
compiler design, combinatory models, garbage collection, storage
management, performance analysis, smalltalks, flavours, common
loops, etc.).

Programming logics (e.g., semantics and reasoning about programs,
types and type inference).

Programming environments and tools (e.g., Knowledge-based
programming tools, program transformations, specifications,
debugging tools).

Applications and experience with symbolic computing (e.g., real-
time programming, artificial intelligence tools, experience with
LISP, object-oriented programming, window systems, user
interfaces, operating systems, parallel/distributed computing.

An editor will be assigned the responsibility of processing the
paper.  Authors are expected to keep the Editors-in-Chief
informed of any change of address.

In-depth reviews of LISP, object-oriented programming and
relevant books are considered for publication.

POLICY ON PRIOR PUBLICATIONS

The technical contributions appearing in Kluwer Academic
Publishers' journals are normally original papers which have not
been published elsewhere.  Widely disseminated conference
proceedings and newsletters are a form of publication, although
they are usually only semiarchival and often unrefereed. 
Publication, or republication, of a (perhaps revised) paper which
has been widely disseminated is permitted only if the editor
judges that (a) the revision contains significant amplification
or clarification of the original material or (b) there is
significant additional benefit to be gained from journal
republication.  In either case, any prior appearance should be
noted on the title page of the paper.

It is the obligation of the author to inform the Editors-in-Chief
if there are any circumstances about the contribution that bear
on this policy, such as the submission or publication elsewhere
of a shorter or expanded version of what is substantially the
same material.

FORMAT.  Finished manuscripts should be formatted with LaTex. A
.sty file will be provided for you via net-mail to insure
continuity.  A sample paper is available if you desire.

Five hard copies of the manuscript should be submitted for
review.  A cover submittal letter signed by the author/s
specifying which topic from the scope is appropriate should be
sent with the hard copy.  Finished page size for publication
should be 6 1/2" x 9 1/2".  Please be sure to include your
ArpaNet address.  The text should be double spaced on one side of
the paper.  To save postage, machine reproductions of papers will
not be returned to authors unless specifically requested. 
Authors' names should be given without titles or degrees along
with the names and address of the organization for which the work
was carried out.  A footnote on the first page should acknowledge
funding sources and presentation, if any, of the material at
technical meetings (give dates and sponsoring societies).

To ensure proper indexing, classification, retrieval and
dissemination, authors should include in the manuscript:

1.  Descriptive title;

2.  Author names and affiliations - with addresses in a footnote;

3.  Informative abstract;

4.  Content indicators of three types:
    (a) Categories and subject descriptors from Scope,
    (b) General terms from Scope,
    (c) Additional key words and phrases;

5.  Citations to the relevant literature.

The following suggestions may be useful in preparing this
information.

DESCRIPTIVE TITLE.  Use a specific and informative title to tell
accurately what the paper is about.  Choose title terms as highly
specific as content of the paper will permit.

AFFILIATION.  The affiliation appearing under the author's name
should be the name of the organization for which the work was
carried out.  When this is no longer the author's current
affiliation, the latter is given in the address footnote on the
first page.

INFORMATIVE ABSTRACT.  The abstract should be 150 to 200 words
and should be short and direct.  It should be informative enough
to serve as a substitute for reading the paper itself.  Work
planned but not done should not be described in the abstract.  Do
not display formulas and do not use citation reference numbers.

REVIEW CRITERIA.  Each paper will be reviewed by experts in the
area specified from the scope as the topic of the paper. 
Acceptance will be based on overall merit and significance of the
reported research, as well as the quality of the presentation.

CITATIONS.
1.  References to items in periodicals.  These should be of the
form: author, title, journal, volume, number, date, pages.  For
authors, last names are given first, even for multiple authors. 
The author's name ends with a period, either the period which
follows his initial or a period for that purpose.  The title has
only the first word and proper names starting with capital
letters, and ends with a period.  The date is given in
parentheses.

Example:
12. Anderson, J.R., and Reiser, B.J. The LISP Tutor, Byte 10, 4
(Apr. 1985) 159-175.

2.  References to Reports or proceedings: Author(s) name(s) and
title (same as above), report number, source including date and
pages.

3.  References to books: Author(s) same as periodicals.  Title,
publisher, year.  Page or chapter reference follow the year.

4.  Sequence: References should be arranged alphabetically
according to author's or editor's names.  References are to be
numbered in the list and those numbers cited in the text.

5.  Accuracy: Authors are responsible for checking that all
information in the references is correct.

6.  Completeness: Include any information necessary for finding
the work referenced.

7.  Format: All references should be typed and double spaced.

FIGURES. Diagrams should be on smooth white paper.  Photographs
should be glossy prints.  Author's name should be on back of each
figure.

COPYRIGHT.  Authors who submit a paper will be sent a sample
copyright form for review.  If the paper is accepted after
refereeing, each author will be asked to sign an actual copyright
form, either transferring copyright to Kluwer Academic Publishers
or declaring that the paper is part of government work.  The
return of the signed copyright form completes the acceptance
process.  Authors retain liberal rights to material published by
Kluwer.

PAGE CHARGE.  Authors' institutions or corporations are requested
to honor a page charge of $50.00 per printed page to help defray
the cost of publication.  Page charges apply to all contributed
papers, articles, etc.  Fifty reprints of each item are furnished
free of charge.  Payment of page charges of not a condition of
publication; editorial acceptance of a paper is unaffected by
payment or nonpayment.
