AIMS AND SCOPE

Machine Learning is an international forum for research
on computational approaches to learning. The journal publishes
articles reporting substantive research results on a wide range of
learning methods applied to a variety of task domains, including but
not limited to:

Methods

Inductive learning methods; Explanation-based learning; Genetic
algorithms; Analogy and case-based methods; Connectionist techniques;
Automated knowledge acquisition; Learning from instruction.

Task Domains

Classification and recognition; Problem solving and planning;
Reasoning and inference; Natural language processing; Design and
diagnosis; Vision and speech perception; Robotics and motor control.

The ideal paper will make a theoretical contribution supported by a
computer implementation. In addition to carefully describing the
learning component, it should also discuss knowledge representation
and performance assumptions. The article should carefully evaluate the
approach through empirical studies, theoretical analysis, or
comparison to psychological phenomena, and should discuss its relation
to other work in machine learning.

Variation from this prototype, such as critical reviews of existing
work, will be considered provided they make a clear contribution to
the field.

INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS

Machine Learning publishes articles on the mechanisms through
which intelligent systems improve their performance over time. 
We invite authors to submit papers describing computational
approaches to any aspect of learning.  We especially encourage
models of human learning, theoretical analyses of learning
tasks, and empirical studies of learning algorithms.

SUBMISSION.  
Authors should submit six (6) copies of papers as indicated:

Five (5) hard copies to:
Mrs. Karen Cullen
MACHINE LEARNING
Kluwer Academic Publishers
101 Philip Drive
Assinippi Park
Norwell, MA 02061

One (1) hard copy to:
Professor Thomas G. Dietterich
Department of Computer Science
Dearborn Hall 303
Oregon State University   
Corvallis,  OR 97331-3202

Also, please send technical and methodological notes (i.e., very
short papers for rapid review) to Mrs. Karen Cullen at the above
address.  Papers will be evaluated based on the results set
forth in the manuscript and not on work in progress.

Book Reviews: Please send two (2) copies of books to be
considered for review to Professor Alberto Segre, Department of
Computer Science, Upson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY
14853-7501.

TITLE PAGE.
Please list your name, affiliation, and complete address on the
title paper, providing a daytime telephone number, and an
electronic mail address if available.  Include a brief, one-
paragraph abstract of 100-200 words and a list of six or fewer
key words.  Also include a shortened version of your title for
use on page headings; identify this as the running head.

TEXT.
Begin the text on a new page following the title page. 
Manuscripts should be typewritten on 8 1/2 x 11 in. paper,
single-sided and double-spaced, with papers numbered
consecutively.  Papers should be 8,000 to 12,000 words in
length, with full-page figures counting for 400 words.  Use
footnotes sparingly, indicating them by consecutive numbers in
the text.  Include acknowledgements in a separate section at the
end of the text.

REFERENCES.
Authors should follow the APA Publication Manual for both the
text and the reference list, with two exceptions: (a) do not cite
the page numbers of any book, including chapters in edited
volumes; (b) use the same format for unpublished references as
for published ones.  Examples for journals, chapters, and
proceedings are given below:

anatomy of a general learning mechanism. Machine Learning, 1, 11-
46.

Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 496-501).

FIGURES AND TABLES.
Mention each figure and table in the text and number them
consecutively using Arabic numerals.  Embed them in the text if
possible to ease the reviewing process.  Figures should contain
graphical material, whereas tables should contain tabular and
typeset material.  Include a brief title above each table and a
caption below each figure.

SPELLING AND TERMINOLOGY.
Authors should employ technical terms with care, using existing
terms when defined by earlier authors and carefully specifying
the sense in which they intend ambiguous terms.  Please keep
abbreviations to a minimum.  American spelling is preferred to
British spelling.

REPRINTS AND PAGE CHARGES.
Authors of published papers will be provided with 50 reprints
free of charge.  No page charges will be levied.
