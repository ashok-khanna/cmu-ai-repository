The Computists' Communique is now available free on the day
of each full moon.  Just reply to laws@ai.sri.com and ask to be
added to the Full Moon distribution.

The Communique is a weekly 32KB newsletter from Computists 
International, a mutual-aid association for AI/IS/CS researchers, 
founded in 1991.    Members get job ads, NSF announcements, grant
and research news, journal calls, business tips, software industry 
analysis, and leads to online resources.  (Ask me if you'd like to
hear more about it.)

Please forward this offer to your friends and local bboards.
